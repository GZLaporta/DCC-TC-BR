HTLV-1 has been associated with several diseases, including an aggressive malignant disease known as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and a chronic inflammatory neurological disease called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy, while HTLV-2 has not been definitively associated with diseases. HTLV-2 is most prevalent in specific groups such as injecting drug users and the indigenous population. In Brazil, most studies about HTLV in indigenous are carried out in indigenous communities from the north of the country. Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), Central Brazil, has the second-largest indigenous population in Brazil. However, there is no available data about HTLV infection in this group. We conducted the first investigation of HTLV-1/2 infection prevalence in the indigenous population from Jaguapiru and Bororó villages in Dourados City, MS, to provide the prevalence and molecular characterization of HTLV. For that, a total of 1875 indigenous participated in the study. All the serum samples were screened by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay commercial kit for the presence of anti-HTLV-1/2 antibodies. Positive samples were confirmed by HTLV-1/2 Western Blot assay. The HTLV-1 5'LTR region was detected by nested PCR amplification and sequenced by Sanger. Most of the study population declared belonging to Guarani-Kaiowá ethnicity (69.18%), 872 (46.51%), and 1003 (53.49%) were from Jaguapiru and Bororó villages, respectively. The median age of participants was 31 years, and 74.24% were females. Two individuals were detected with HTLV-1 (0.1%; CI 95% 0.1-0.2). The phylogenetic analysis revealed that isolates belong to the Cosmopolitan subtype and the Transcontinental subgroup (HTLV-1aA). The low HTLV-1 prevalence found in this study is similar to that observed among blood donors, and pregnant populations from Mato Grosso do Sul. The absence of HTLV-2 infection among these Brazilian indigenous communities would suggest a distinct behavior pattern from other indigenous populations in Brazil."

Notification data provided by the Ministry of Health in combination with the mapping of vulnerable geographic areas is essential to forecasting possible outbreaks and more effectively combating infection through monitoring. We aim to evaluate the spatiotemporal distribution and epidemiological aspects of reported cases of CS and SiP in Brazil. A retrospective ecological study was carried out using secondary surveillance data obtained from the Brazilian National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) database, considering all reported cases of CS and SiP between 2001 to 2017. Epidemiological characteristics and time trends were analyzed using joinpoint regression models and spatial distribution, considering microregions or states/macroregions as units of analysis. A total of 188,630 (359/100,000 birth lives) CS and 235,895 of SiP (6.3/100,000 inhabitants) were reported during the period studied. In general, the epidemiologic profile of Brazil indicates most reported CS cases occurred in ""mixed-race"" newborns who were diagnosed within seven days of birth and whose mothers had received prenatal care, but the epidemiologic profile varies by Brazilian macroregion. Regarding SiP, most cases were among women who self-reported 'mixed-race', were aged 20-39 years, had up to eight years of formal education and were diagnosed with primary or latent syphilis. Approximately 549 (98.4%) and 558 (100%) microregions reported at least one case of CS and SiP, respectively. From 2012 to 2016, CS cases increased significantly in almost all Brazilian states, most notably in the South, Southeast, and Central-West macroregions, from 2001-2017 and the relative risk (RR) of SiP increased around 400% (RR: 1,00 to 445,50). Considering the epidemiological scenario of the infection in Brazil, it is necessary to enhance preventive, control and eradication measures."

METHODS: A multinational retrospective study was performed at 14 hospitals. All definite IE episodes between January 2000 and April 2021 were included. The main outcomes were maternal mortality and pregnancy-related complications. RESULTS: Twenty-five episodes of IE were included. Median age at IE diagnosis was 33.2 years (IQR 28.3-36.6) and median gestational age was 30 weeks (IQR 16-32). Thirteen (52%) patients had no previously known heart disease. Sixteen (64%) were native IE, 7 (28%) prosthetic and 2 (8%) cardiac implantable electronic device IE. The most common aetiologies were streptococci (n = 10, 40%), staphylococci (n = 5, 20%), HACEK group (n = 3, 12%) and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 3, 12%). Twenty (80%) patients presented at least one IE complication; the most common were heart failure (n = 13, 52%) and symptomatic embolism other than stroke (n = 4, 16%). Twenty-one (84%) patients had surgery indication and surgery was performed when indicated in 19 (90%). There was one maternal death and 16 (64%) patients presented pregnancy-related complications (11 patients ≥1 complication): 3 pregnancy losses, 9 urgent Caesarean sections, 2 emergency Caesarean sections, 1 fetal death, and 11 preterm births. Two patients presented a relapse during a median follow-up of 3.1 years (IQR 0.6-7.4). CONCLUSIONS: Strict medical surveillance of pregnant women with IE is required and must involve a multidisciplinary team including obstetricians and neonatologists. Furthermore, the potential risk of IE during pregnancy should never be underestimated in women with previously known underlying heart disease."

The human infection usually manifests as a febrile and incapacitating arthritogenic illness, self-limiting and non-lethal. However, since 2013, CHIKV spreading through the tropics and to the Americas was accompanied by an increasing number of cases of atypical disease presentation, namely severe neuropathies and neonatal infection due to intrapartum vertical transmission. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these conditions have not been fully elucidated. However, arbovirus intrahost genetic diversity is thought to be linked to viral pathogenesis. To determine whether particular viral variants could be somehow associated, we analyzed the intrahost genetic diversity of CHIKV in three infected patients with neurological manifestations and three mothers infected during the intrapartum period, as well as their babies following vertical transmission. No statistically supported differences were observed for the genetic variability (nucleotide substitutions/gene length) along the genome between the groups. However, the newborn and cerebrospinal fluid samples (corresponding to virus passed through the placenta and/or the blood-brain barrier (BBB)) presented a different composition of their intrahost mutant ensembles compared to maternal or patient serum samples, even when concurrent. This finding could be consistent with the unidirectional virus transmission through these barriers, and the effect of selective bottlenecks during the transmission event. In addition, a higher proportion of defective variants (insertions/deletions and stop codons) was detected in the CSF and maternal samples and those were mainly distributed within the viral non-structural genes. Since defective viral genomes in RNA viruses are known to contribute to the outcome of acute viral infections and influence disease severity, their role in these atypical cases should be further investigated. Finally, with the in silico approach adopted, we detected no relevant non-conservative mutational pattern that could provide any hint of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these atypical cases. The present analysis represents a unique contribution to our understanding of the transmission events in these cases and generates hypotheses regarding underlying mechanisms, that can be explored further."

They gave birth between August 2020 to January 2021, a period in which there was still no vaccination for COVID-19 in Brazil. In addition, their placental alterations were later investigated, focusing on macroscopic, histopathological, and ultrastructural aspects compared to a prepandemic sample. Three of five placentas presented SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCRq at least two to twenty weeks after primary pregnancy infection symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was detected in all placentas by immunoperoxidase assay. The macroscopic evaluation of the placentas presented congested vascular trunks, massive deposition of fibrin, areas of infarctions, and calcifications. Histopathological analysis showed fibrin deposition, inflammatory infiltrate, necrosis, and blood vessel thrombosis. Ultrastructural aspects of the infected placentas showed a similar pattern of alterations between the samples, with predominant characteristics of apoptosis and detection of virus-like particles. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in placental tissue, vertical transmission."

The exact mechanism by which the placenta participates in regulating the TH concentration in the fetus and mother and the role of TH in the placenta are still poorly studied. In this review, we aim to summarize the available data in the area and highlight significant gaps in our understanding of the ontogeny and cell-specific localization of TH transporters, TH receptors, and TH metabolic enzymes in the placenta in both human and rodent models. Significant deficiencies also exist in the knowledge of the contribution of genomic and nongenomic effects of TH on the placenta and finally, how the placenta reacts during pregnancy when the mother has thyroid disease. By addressing these key knowledge gaps, improved pregnancy outcomes and management of women with thyroid alterations may be possible."

In humans, early overnutrition has been associated with higher susceptibility to obesity and metabolic disorders in childhood and adulthood. In rodents, using a rodent litter size reduction model (small litter) to mimic early overfeeding, the same metabolic profile has been described. Therefore, the rodent small litter model is an efficient tool to investigate the adaptive mechanisms involved in obesogenesis. Besides central and metabolic dysfunctions, studies have pointed to the contribution of the endocrine system to the small litter phenotype. Hormones, especially leptin, insulin, and adrenal hormones, have been associated with satiety, glucose homeostasis, and adipogenesis, while hypothyroidism impairs energy metabolism, favoring obesity. Behavioral modifications, hepatic metabolism changes, and reproductive dysfunctions have also been reported. In this review, we update these findings, highlighting the interaction of early nutrition and the adaptive features of the endocrine system. We also report the sex-related differences and epigenetic mechanisms. This model highlights the intense plasticity during lactation triggering many adaptive responses, which are the basis of the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) concept. Our review demonstrates the complexity of the adaptive mechanisms involved in the obesity phenotype promoted by early overnutrition, reinforcing the necessity of adequate nutritional habits during lactation."

The Inc-5 strain showed increased infectivity and modulated IL-1β, IL-10 and TLR-4, decreasing their expression after 24 h of infection. Both strains (Inc-5 and Ninoa) stimulated the production of TNF-α and decreased IL-6 levels 96 h after infection. An important detachment of the syncytiotrophoblast caused by infection with T. cruzi was observed after 24 h of infection. In this study, ex vivo infection of human placental villi was performed to better understand interactions involving parasitic T. cruzi and human placental tissue. It was concluded that the strains of TcIa present parasitism in placental tissue, modulation of the innate immune system of the placenta, and cause intense detachment of the syncytiotrophoblast, a fact that may be more associated with abortion and premature birth events than the congenital transmission itself, justifying the low rate of this transmission mechanism by this genotype.

METHODS: This study was a post hoc analysis of an open-label randomized trial to evaluate the virologic response of 2 ART regimens. The participants were ART-naive women living with HIV initiating ART regimens between 20 and 36 weeks of pregnancy recruited at 19 clinical sites in 6 countries. Participants were randomized to receive 400 mg of raltegravir 2 times a day or 600 mg of efavirenz 4 times a day in addition to 150 mg of lamivudine and 300 mg of zidovudine 2 times a day.

ZIKV neurotropism is well characterized, but the role of peripheral viral amplification to brain infection remains unknown. Here, we found that ZIKV replicates in human primary skeletal muscle myoblasts, impairing its differentiation into myotubes but not interfering with the integrity of the already-formed muscle fibers. Using mouse models, we showed ZIKV tropism to muscle tissue either during embryogenesis after maternal transmission or when infection occurred after birth. Interestingly, ZIKV replication in the mouse skeletal muscle started immediately after ZIKV inoculation, preceding viral RNA detection in the brain and causing no disruption to the integrity of the blood brain barrier, and remained active for more than 2 weeks, whereas replication in the spleen and liver were not sustained over time. In addition, ZIKV infection of the skeletal muscle induces necrotic lesions, inflammation, and fiber atrophy. We also found a reduction in the expression of regulatory myogenic factors that are essential for muscle repair after injury. Taken together, our results indicate that the skeletal muscle is an early site of viral amplification and lesion that may result in late consequences in muscle development after ZIKV infection. IMPORTANCE Zika Virus (ZIKV) neurotropism and its deleterious effects on central nervous system have been well characterized. However, investigations of the initial replication sites for the establishment of infection and viral spread to neural tissues remain underexplored. A complete description of the range of ZIKV-induced lesions and others factors that can influence the severity of the disease is necessary to prevent ZIKV's deleterious effects. ZIKV has been shown to access the central nervous system without significantly affecting blood-brain barrier permeability. Here, we demonstrated that skeletal muscle is an earlier site of ZIKV replication, contributing to the increase of peripheral ZIKV load. ZIKV replication in muscle promotes necrotic lesions and inflammation and also impairs myogenesis. Overall, our findings showed that skeletal muscle is involved in pathogenesis and opens new fields in the investigation of the long-term consequences of early infection."

Here we evaluated ZIKV neutralizing antibody (nAb) kinetics in infants born to mothers with PCR-confirmed ZIKV infection during pregnancy. METHODS: Neonates (n = 98) had serum specimens tested repeatedly for ZIKV nAb over the first 2 years of life using virus neutralization test (VNT). ZIKV neonatal infection was confirmed by RT-PCR in blood or urine and/or presence of ZIKV IgM antibodies, and results were correlated with infant clinical features. RESULTS: Postnatal laboratory evidence of ZIKV vertical transmission was obtained for 60.2% of children, while 32.7% exhibited clinical abnormalities. Congenital abnormalities were found in 37.3% of children with confirmed ZIKV infection and 31.0% of children without confirmed infection (P = .734). All but 1 child displayed a physiologic decline in ZIKV nAb, reflecting maternal antibody decay, despite an early ZIKV-IgM response in one-third of infants. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with antenatal ZIKV exposure do not develop ZIKV nAb despite an early IgM response. Therefore, ZIKV VNT in children is not useful for diagnosis of congenital infection. In light of these findings, it remains to be determined if children infected in utero are potentially susceptible to reinfection."

RESULTS: Of 5895 pregnant women analysed, 54.7% showed seronegativity and 44.4% showed seropositivity for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii. This seropositivity rate increased to 68.3% when only considering participants from rural areas. Multivariate analysis revealed higher odds of being seropositive associated with age (odds ratio [OR] 1.06 [confidence interval {CI} 1.05 to 1.07]) and with living in rural areas (OR 2.96 [CI 1.64 to 5.36]). The spatial distribution of IgG seropositivity indicated a higher prevalence concentrated in rural and peripheral neighbourhoods.

A key player in placental lipid handling is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). PPARγ influences global gene expression via its regulation of the epigenetic modifier lysine methyltransferase 5A (KMT5A), which places a methyl group on histone 4 lysine 20 (H4K20me) of target genes. Here we test the hypothesis that KMT5A is present in both the human and rat placentas and is affected by uteroplacental insufficiency (UPI) in the rat in association with increased placental lipid accumulation. We assessed levels and localization of KMT5A, as well as lipid droplet accumulation, in human placental tissue collected from maternal donors after delivery by planned cesarean section. Using a rat model of UPI, we also evaluated the effects of UPI on lipid accumulation, PPARγ, KMT5A, and H4K20me in the rat placenta. In this study, we show for the first time the presence and activity of KMT5A, in human and in rat placentas.

At the same time, the role of Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) is limited by the low proportion of symptomatic infections and the low average viral load. Here, we compared the diagnostic performance of commercially available IgM, IgAM, and IgG ELISAs in sequential samples during the ZIKV and chikungunya (CHIKV) epidemics and co-circulation of dengue virus (DENV) in Brazil and Venezuela. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Acute (day of illness 1-5) and follow-up (day of illness ≥ 6) blood samples were collected from nine hundred and seven symptomatic patients enrolled in a prospective multicenter study between June 2012 and August 2016. Acute samples were tested by RT-PCR for ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV. Acute and follow-up samples were tested for IgM, IgAM, and IgG antibodies to ZIKV using commercially available ELISAs. Among follow-up samples with a RT-PCR confirmed ZIKV infection, anti-ZIKV IgAM sensitivity was 93.5% (43/46), while IgM and IgG exhibited sensitivities of 30.3% (10/33) and 72% (18/25), respectively. An additional 24% (26/109) of ZIKV infections were detected via IgAM seroconversion in ZIKV/DENV/CHIKV RT-PCR negative patients. The specificity of anti-ZIKV IgM was estimated at 93% and that of IgAM at 85%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings exemplify the challenges of the assessment of test performance for ZIKV serological tests in the real-world setting, during co-circulation of DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV. However, we can also demonstrate that the IgAM immunoassay exhibits superior sensitivity to detect ZIKV RT-PCR confirmed infections compared to IgG and IgM immunoassays. The IgAM assay also proves to be promising for detection of anti-ZIKV seroconversions in sequential samples, both in ZIKV PCR-positive as well as PCR-negative patients, making this a candidate assay for serological monitoring of pregnant women in future ZIKV outbreaks."

Understanding the mechanism could inform the development of potential therapies against prenatal ZIKV brain calcification. In perivascular cells, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) is an osteogenic factor that undergoes maturation to activate osteogenesis and calcification. Here, we show that ZIKV infection of cultivated primary human brain pericytes triggers BMP2 maturation, leading to osteogenic gene expression and calcification. We observed extensive calcification near ZIKV(+) pericytes of fetal human brain specimens and in vertically transmitted ZIKV(+) human signal transducer and activator of transcription 2-knockin mouse pup brains. ZIKV infection of primary pericytes stimulated BMP2 maturation, inducing osteogenic gene expression and calcification that were completely blocked by anti-BMP2/4 neutralizing antibody. Not only did ZIKV NS3 expression alone induce BMP2 maturation, osteogenic gene expression and calcification, but purified NS3 protease also effectively cleaved pro-BMP2 in vitro to generate biologically active mature BMP2. These findings highlight ZIKV-induced calcification where the NS3 protease subverts the BMP2-mediated osteogenic signalling pathway to trigger brain calcification."

Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in pregnant women and the rate of congenital transmission in the Federal District. A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of T. cruzi from 2014 to 2016 in the population of pregnant women attended by the public health service throughout the Federal District and a descriptive cohort for the evaluation of congenital transmission. During the study, prenatal data of 98,895 women were consulted and pregnant women registered in 2016, presenting with positive T. cruzi serology, were part of the descriptive cohort. The estimated prevalence of T. cruzi infection in the three years was 0.19% and the congenital transmission rate was 1/40 (2.5%).

The primary objective was to determine whether the same model structure could be used to represent pertussis disease dynamics in differing socioeconomic conditions. METHODS: We tested three model structures (SIR, SIRS, SIRSIs) to represent population-level transmission in three socio-demographically distinct Brazilian states: São Paulo, Paraná and Bahia. Two strategies were evaluated: infant wP vaccination alone versus maternal aP immunization plus infant wP vaccination. Model projections for 2014-2029 include outpatient and inpatient pertussis cases, pertussis deaths, years of life lost, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost, and costs (in 2014 USD) of maternal aP vaccination, infant vaccination, and pertussis medical treatment. Incremental cost per DALY averted is presented from the perspective of the Brazilian National Health System. RESULTS: Based on goodness-of-fit statistics, the SIRSIs model fit best, although it had only a modest improvement in statistical quantitative assessments relative to the SIRS model. For all three Brazilian states, maternal aP immunization led to higher costs but also saved infant lives and averted DALYs. The 2014 USD cost/DALY averted was $3068 in Sao Paulo, $2962 in Parana, and $2022 in Bahia. These results were robust in sensitivity analyses with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios exceeding per capita gross regional product only when the probability that a pertussis case is reported was assumed higher than base case implying more overt cases and deaths and therefore more medical costs.

Current flavivirus serology for ZIKV infections lacks specificity due to cross-reacting antibodies from closely related other flaviviruses. In this study, we evaluated novel serological tests for accurate ZIKV IgG detection. METHODS: Our ELISAs are based on immune complex binding. The high specificity is achieved by the simultaneous incubation of labelled ZIKV antigen and unlabelled flavivirus homolog protein competitors. Two assays were validated with a panel of 406 human samples from PCR-confirmed ZIKV patients collected in Brazil (n = 154), healthy blood donors and other infections from Brazil, Europe, Canada and Colombia (n = 252). RESULTS: The highest specificity (100% [252/252, 95% confidence interval (CI) 98.5-100.0]) was shown by the ZIKV ED3 ICB ELISA using the ED3 antigen of the ZIKV envelope. A similar test using the NS1 antigen (ZIKV NS1 ICB ELISA) was slightly less specific (92.1% [232/252, 95% CI 88.0-95.1]). The commercial Euroimmun ZIKV ELISA had a specificity of only 82.1% (207/252, 95% CI 76.8-86.7). Sensitivity was high (93-100%) from day 12 after onset of symptoms in all three tests. Seroprevalence of ZIKV IgG was analysed in 87 samples from Laos (Asia) confirming that the ED3 ELISA showed specific reactions in other populations. CONCLUSIONS: The novel ED3 ICB ELISA will be useful for ZIKV-specific IgG detection for seroepidemiological studies and serological diagnosis for case management in travellers and in countries where other flavivirus infections are co-circulating."

Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a rapid point-of-care test (RT) and treatment of positive mothers immediately compared with a laboratory-based standard test (ST) with treatment at next follow-up visit. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between antenatal syphilis screening strategies. The model was built with lifetime horizon from Brazilian health system perspective using 3% and 5% discount rates. A hypothetical cohort of pregnant women at reproductive age were used in the model. Health outcomes: low birth weight, stillbirths, neonatal deaths and congenital syphilis were estimated in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost. Microcosting study and secondary data provided parameters of direct medical costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: For base case, the mean cost per pregnant woman screened was $2.63 (RT) and $2.48 (ST), respectively. Maternal syphilis was associated with a loss of 0.0043 DALYs (RT) and 0.0048 DALYs (ST) per mother screened. Expected value of incremental cost per DALY averted was $298.08. After 10 000 probabilistic sensitivity analysis model runs, incremental cost and health benefits were $0.15 (95% credible interval -1.56 to 1.92) and 0.00042 DALYs (95% credible interval -0.0036 to 0.0044), respectively, with a mean ICER of $357.44 per DALY. Screening with RT has a 58% chance of being the optimal strategy at a threshold of $3,200 per DALY. CONCLUSIONS: In Brazil, antenatal screening with syphilis RT and immediate treatment is likely to be cost-effective compared with standard screening and must be prioritized in local settings."

This study reviews knowledge on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and describes the outcome of published cases of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMed®, Scopus®, Web of Science®, and MedRxiv® up to 26th June 2020, using PRISMA standards, to identify original published studies describing pregnant women at any gestational age diagnosed COVID-19. There were no date or language restrictions on the search. All identified studies were included irrespective of assumptions on study quality. Results: We identified 161 original studies reporting 3,985 cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 (1,007 discharged while pregnant). The 2,059 published cases with pregnancy outcomes resulted in 42 abortions, 21 stillbirths, and 2,015 live births. Preterm birth occurred in 23% of cases. Around 6% of pregnant women required admission to an intensive care unit and 28 died. There were 10 neonatal deaths. From the 163 cases with amniotic fluid, placenta, and/or cord blood analyzed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 10 were positive. Sixty-one newborns were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Four breast milk samples from 92 cases showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: Emerging evidence suggests that vertical transmission is possible, however, there is still a limited number of reported cases with intrapartum samples. Information, counseling and adequate monitoring are essential to prevent and manage adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy."

The minimal progress in the development of new drugs highlights the need for advances in basic research on crucial biochemical pathways in T. cruzi to identify new targets. Here, we report on the T. cruzi presenilin-like transmembrane aspartyl enzyme, a protease of the aspartic class in a unique phylogenetic subgroup with T. vivax separate from protozoans. Computational analyses suggest it contains nine transmembrane domains and an active site with the characteristic PALP motif of the A22 family. Multiple linear B-cell epitopes were identified by SPOT-synthesis analysis with Chagasic patient sera. Two were chosen to generate rabbit antisera, whose signal was primarily localized to the flagellar pocket, intracellular vesicles, and endoplasmic reticulum in parasites by whole-cell immunofluorescence. The results suggest that the parasitic presenilin-like enzyme could have a role in the secretory pathway and serve as a target for the generation of new therapeutics specific to the T. cruzi. © 2020 by the authors.

METHODS: Transcriptome data from placental tissues of pregnant women naturally infected with Zika virus during the third trimester were compared to those from women who tested negative for Zika infection. The findings were validated using both a cell culture model and an immunohistochemistry/morphological analysis of naturally infected placental tissues. RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis revealed that Zika virus infection induces downregulation of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) gene, an essential factor for fetal development. The Caco-2 cell culture model that constitutively expresses IGF2 was used for the transcriptome validation. Asiatic and African Zika virus strains infection caused downregulated IGF2 gene expression in Caco-2 cells, whereas other flaviviruses, such as dengue serotype 1, West Nile and wild-type yellow fever viruses, had no effect on this gene expression. Immunohistochemical assays on decidual tissues corroborated our transcriptome analysis, showing that IGF2 is reduced in the decidua of Zika virus-infected women. CONCLUSIONS: Our results draw attention to IGF2 modulation in uterine tissues, and this finding is expected to support future studies on strategies to ameliorate the harmful effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy."

The level of parasitemia is a known risk factor for congenital transmission. Benznidazole (BZN) is the drug of choice for preconceptional treatment to reduce parasitic load. The fear of treatment-related side effects limits the implementation of the Argentine guideline recommending BZN 60d/300 mg (or equivalent) treatment of T. cruzi seropositive women during the postpartum period to prevent transmission in a future pregnancy. A short and low dose BZN treatment might reduce major side effects and increase compliance, but its efficacy to reduce T. cruzi parasitic load compared to the standard 60d/300 mg course is not yet established. Clinical trials testing alternative BZN courses among women of reproductive age are urgently needed. Methods and design: We are proposing to perform a double-blinded, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial comparing a short low dose 30-day treatment with BZN 150 mg/day (30d/150 mg) vs. BZN 60d/300 mg. We will recruit not previously treated T. cruzi seropositive women with a live birth during the postpartum period in Argentina, randomize them at 6 months postpartum, and follow them up with the following specific aims: Specific aim 1: to measure the effect of BZN 30d/150 mg compared to 60d/300 mg preconceptional treatment on parasitic load measured by the frequency of positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (primary outcome) and by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), immediately and 10 months after treatment.

The data were pooled using a random-effects model, and choropleth maps were created based on geopolitical regions and countries. RESULTS: The search identified 7788 articles, of which 50 were eligible. We observed a 9% prevalence of Chagas disease among pregnant women in the Americas (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8-10, I(2)  = 99.96%). High disease prevalence was identified in pregnant women in South American countries (12%, 95% CI: 11-13), while lower values were identified in pregnant women in North America (2%, 95% CI: 1-3). Countries with medium Human Development Index (HDI) had a higher prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women (15%, 95% CI: 13-16, I(2)  = 99.98%) than countries with high HDI (3%, 95% CI: 2-3). The rate of vertical transmission in the continent was 2% (95% CI: 1-2). The statistical analysis showed that this heterogeneity was explained by the study design, region of the Americas and mean income of the country. CONCLUSION: South and Central American countries have a high prevalence and vertical transmission of Chagas disease. Therefore, systematic screens for this disease during the prenatal period are necessary in addition to the diagnosis and treatment of children at risk for Trypanosoma cruzi infection."

Infected individuals have different symptoms, including rash and pruritus, which can be relieved by the administration of antiallergics. In the case of pregnant women, ZIKV can cross the placenta and infect the fetus leading to congenital defects. We have identified that mast cells in the placentae of patients who had Zika during pregnancy can be infected. This led to our investigation on the possible role of mast cells during a ZIKV infection, using the HMC-1 cell line. We analyzed their permissiveness to infection, release of mediators and ultrastructural changes. Flow cytometry detection of ZIKV-NS1 expression 24 h post infection in 45.3% of cells showed that HMC-1 cells are permissive to ZIKV infection. Following infection, β-hexosaminidase was measured in the supernatant of the cells with a notable release at 30 min. In addition, an increase in TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and VEGF levels were measured at 6 h and 24 h post infection. Lastly, different intracellular changes were observed in an ultrastructural analysis of infected cells. Our findings suggest that mast cells may represent an important source of mediators that can activate other immune cell types during a ZIKV infection, which has the potential to be a major contributor in the spread of the virus in cases of vertical transmission."

An invigorated global END TB Strategy seeks to increase efforts in scaling up TB preventive therapy (TPT) as a central intervention for HIV programmes in an effort to contribute to a 90% reduction in TB incidence and 95% reduction in mortality by 2035. TPT in PLHIV should be part of a comprehensive approach to reduce TB transmission, illness and death that also includes TB active case-finding and prompt, effective and timely initiation of anti-TB therapy among PLHIV. However, the use and implementation of preventive strategies has remained deplorably inadequate and today TB prevention among PLHIV has become an urgent priority globally. DISCUSSION: We present a summary of the current and novel TPT regimens, including current evidence of use with antiretroviral regimens (ART). We review challenges and opportunities to scale-up TB prevention within HIV programmes, including the use of differentiated care approaches and demand creation for effective TB/HIV services delivery. TB preventive vaccines and diagnostics, including optimal algorithms, while important topics, are outside of the focus of this commentary. CONCLUSIONS: A number of new tools and strategies to make TPT a standard of care in HIV programmes have become available. The new TPT regimens are safe and effective and can be used with current ART, with attention being paid to potential drug-drug interactions between rifamycins and some classes of antiretrovirals. More research and development is needed to optimize TPT for small children, pregnant women and drug-resistant TB (DR-TB). Effective programmatic scale-up can be supported through context-adapted demand creation strategies and the inclusion of TPT in client-centred services, such as differentiated service delivery (DSD) models. Robust collaboration between the HIV and TB programmes represents a unique opportunity to ensure that TB, a preventable and curable condition, is no longer the number one cause of death in PLHIV."

Subsequently, the evidence has continued to accumulate, which we incorporate in regular updates of the original work, rendering it a living systematic review. Methods: We present an update of our living systematic review on the causal relation between ZIKV infection and adverse congenital outcomes and between ZIKV and GBS for four dimensions of causality: strength of association, dose-response, specificity, and consistency. We assess the evidence published between January 18, 2017 and July 1, 2019. Results: We found that the strength of association between ZIKV infection and adverse outcomes from case-control studies differs according to whether exposure to ZIKV is assessed in the mother (OR 3.8, 95% CI: 1.7-8.7, I (2)=19.8%) or the foetus/infant (OR 37.4, 95% CI: 11.0-127.1, I (2)=0%). In cohort studies, the risk of congenital abnormalities was 3.5 times higher after ZIKV infection (95% CI: 0.9-13.5, I (2)=0%). The strength of association between ZIKV infection and GBS was higher in studies that enrolled controls from hospital (OR: 55.8, 95% CI: 17.2-181.7, I (2)=0%) than in studies that enrolled controls at random from the same community or household (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 0.8-5.4, I (2)=74.6%). In case-control studies, selection of controls from hospitals could have biased results. Conclusions: The conclusions that ZIKV infection causes adverse congenital outcomes and GBS are reinforced with the evidence published between January 18, 2017 and July 1, 2019."

Additionally, a decrease in placental Abca1 (ABCA1), Abcb1b (P-glycoprotein), Abcb9 and Abcg2 (BCRP) expression was observed in MiP mice. In conclusion, MiP associated with PTD impairs placental ABC transporters' expression, potentially modulating placental nutrient, environmental toxin and xenobiotic biodistribution within the fetal compartment, and may, at some degree, be involved with pregnancy outcome in MiP."

In the absence of a ZIKV vaccine or prophylactics, principal investigators (PIs) and international leaders in ZIKV research have formed the ZIKV Individual Participant Data (IPD) Consortium to identify, collect and synthesise IPD from longitudinal studies of pregnant women that measure ZIKV infection during pregnancy and fetal, infant or child outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will identify eligible studies through the ZIKV IPD Consortium membership and a systematic review and invite study PIs to participate in the IPD meta-analysis (IPD-MA). We will use the combined dataset to estimate the relative and absolute risk of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), including microcephaly and late symptomatic congenital infections; identify and explore sources of heterogeneity in those estimates and develop and validate a risk prediction model to identify the pregnancies at the highest risk of CZS or adverse developmental outcomes. The variable accuracy of diagnostic assays and differences in exposure and outcome definitions means that included studies will have a higher level of systematic variability, a component of measurement error, than an IPD-MA of studies of an established pathogen. We will use expert testimony, existing internal and external diagnostic accuracy validation studies and laboratory external quality assessments to inform the distribution of measurement error in our models. We will apply both Bayesian and frequentist methods to directly account for these and other sources of uncertainty. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The IPD-MA was deemed exempt from ethical review. We will convene a group of patient advocates to evaluate the ethical implications and utility of the risk stratification tool. Findings from these analyses will be shared via national and international conferences and through publication in open access, peer-reviewed journals.

RESULTS: The epidemiological profile of American trypanosomiasis, which is still considered a neglected disease of the poor people of Latin America, has changed over time. A family-based study demonstrated that the blood protozoan T. cruzi can be transmitted sexually from infected males and females to naïve mates. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence that Chagas disease can be transmitted sexually, coupled with the migration of individuals with Chagas disease to previously non-endemic countries and increased travel to endemic countries, has implications for public health.

To reduce these restrictions, we developed a strategy involving use of molecules containing repetitive fragments of Trypanosoma cruzi conserved proteins. Diagnostic performance of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens (Molecular Biology Institute of Paraná - IBMP in Portuguese acronym) was assessed to diagnose T. cruzi-infected and non-infected immigrants living in Barcelona (Spain), a non-endemic setting for Chagas disease. Methods: Reactivity of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 was assessed using an in-house automated ELISA with 347 positive and 331 negative individuals to Chagas disease. Antigenic cross-reactivity was measured with sera samples from pregnant women with Toxoplasma gondii (n = 98) and Zika virus (n = 75) antibodies. Results: The area under the curve values was 1 and 0.99 for the IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 proteins, respectively, demonstrating excellent diagnostic accuracy. The reactivity index was higher for IBMP-8.1 than IBMP-8.4 in positive samples and no significant difference in reactivity index was observed in negative samples. Sensitivity ranged from 99.4% for IBMP-8.1 to 99.1% for IBMP-8.4 and was not statistically different. Specificity for IBMP-8.1 reached 100 and 99.7% for IBMP-8.4, both nearly 100% accurate. No antigenic cross-reactivity was observed and reactivity index was similar to that for negative Chagas disease individuals. Conclusions: Our results showed an outstanding performance of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens by ELISA and suggest both chimeric antigens could also be used for Chagas disease diagnosis in immigrants living in non-endemic settings. © 2019 The Author(s)."

OBJECTIVES: To perform general movement assessment (GMA) at 9 to 20 weeks' postterm age and to evaluate whether the findings are associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 12 months in infants prenatally exposed to acute maternal illness with rash in Brazil during the ZIKV outbreak and in age-matched controls. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, infants prenatally exposed to acute maternal illness with rash were recruited at medical institutions in Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, Brazil, from February 1, 2016, to April 30, 2017, while infants without any exposure to maternal illness originated from the Graz University Audiovisual Research Database for the Interdisciplinary Analysis of Neurodevelopment. Participants were 444 infants, including 76 infants without congenital microcephaly, 35 infants with microcephaly, and 333 neurotypical children matched for sex, gestational age at birth, and age at GMA. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: General movement assessment performed at 9 to 20 weeks' postterm age, with negative predictive value, positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity generated, as well as clinical, neurologic, and developmental status (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition [Bayley-III] scores) at age 12 months. Motor Optimality Scores were generated based on the overall quality of the motor repertoire. Adverse outcomes were defined as a Bayley-III score less than 2 SD in at least 1 domain, a score less than 1 SD in at least 2 domains, and/or atypical neurologic findings. RESULTS: A total of 444 infants were enrolled, including 111 children prenatally exposed to a maternal illness with rash and 333 children without any prenatal exposure to maternal illness (57.7% male and mean [SD] age, 14 [2] weeks for both groups); 82.1% (46 of 56) of ZIKV-exposed infants without congenital microcephaly were healthy at age 12 months. Forty-four of 46 infants were correctly identified by GMA at 3 months, with a negative predictive value of 94% (95% CI, 85%-97%). Seven of 10 ZIKV-exposed children without microcephaly with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes were identified by GMA. The GMA positive predictive value was 78% (95% CI, 46%-94%), sensitivity was 70% (95% CI, 35%-93%), specificity was 96% (95% CI, 85%-99%), and accuracy was 91% (95% CI, 80%-97%). Children with microcephaly had bilateral spastic cerebral palsy; none had normal movements. The Motor Optimality Score differentiated outcomes: the median Motor Optimality Score was 23 (interquartile range [IQR], 21-26) in children with normal development, 12 (IQR, 8-19) in children with adverse outcomes, and 5 (IQR, 5-6) in children with microcephaly, a significant difference (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that although a large proportion of ZIKV-exposed infants without microcephaly develop normally, many do not. The GMA should be incorporated into routine infant assessments to enable early entry into targeted treatment programs."

METHODS: Infectious morbidity, mortality and undernutrition were evaluated within a cohort of 1000 HEU infants enrolled between April 2004 and April 2010 in Brazil (n = 766) and South Africa (n = 234) as part of the NICHD/HPTN 040 trial of 3 different antiretroviral regimens to decrease intrapartum HIV vertical transmission. RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of infants had at least 1 infectious serious adverse effect. Infants born to mothers with <12 years of education [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-5.9), with maternal viral load of >1,000,000 copies/mL at delivery (AOR, 9.9; 95% CI, 1.6-63.1) were more likely to have infectious serious adverse effects. At 6 months, the infant mortality rate per 1000 live births overall was 22 ± 2.6, 9.1 ± 1.8 in Brazil and 64.1 ± 3 in South Africa. Undernutrition and stunting peaked at 1 month of age with 18% having a weight-for-age Z score ≤-2, and 22% with height for Z score ≤-2. The likelihood of infant mortality was greater among infants born in South Africa compared with Brazil (AOR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2.5-15.8), high maternal viral load (AOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.01-2.9) and birth weight-for-age Z score ≤-2 (AOR, 5.2; 95% CI, 1.8-14.8). CONCLUSIONS: There were high rates of undernutrition, stunting and infectious serious adverse effect in this study's formula-fed HEU population. Suppressing maternal HIV viral load during the peripartum period may be a modifiable risk factor to decrease infant mortality."

Hence, the infection-induced alterations of maternal immunity often lead to adverse outcomes for mother and/or child. The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women has been associated with more than 3,000 cases of microcephaly and nervous system malformations. METHODS: To explore the potential correlation of ZIKV-induced alteration of maternal immunity with fetal abnormalities, we performed extensive sera immunoprofiling of 74 pregnant women: 30 symptomatic ZIKV+ pregnant patients and 30 healthy pregnant controls in ZIKV-endemic Rio de Janeiro, along with 14 healthy pregnant controls in non-endemic Los Angeles. RESULTS: Extensive multiplexing analysis of 69 cytokines revealed that CXCL10, CCL2, and CCL8 chemokines were specifically associated with symptomatic ZIKV+ infection during pregnancy, and distinct immunoprofiles were detected at different trimesters in ZIKV-infected pregnant women. Intriguingly, the high CCL2 level and its inverse correlation with CD163, TNFRSF1A, and CCL22 levels was apparently associated with ZIKV-induced abnormal birth. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide insights into the alteration of ZIKV-elicited maternal immunity, serving as a potential clinical biomarker platform.

METHODS: Infants with antenatal ZIKV exposure were referred for evaluation during the 2015-2016 Rio de Janeiro outbreak. Mothers with symptomatic ZIKV infection during pregnancy and/or infants with microcephaly or other findings that were suggestive of suspected antenatal exposure were tested with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Complete eye examinations were performed by pediatric ophthalmologists between January 2016 and February 2017. The main outcome measure was eye abnormalities in RT-PCR-positive and suspected (ie, not tested or RT-PCR-negative) antenatal ZIKV cases. RESULTS: Of 224 infants, 189 had RT-PCR testing performed. Of 189 patients, 156 had positive RT-PCR results in their blood, urine, and/or placenta. Of 224 infants, 90 had central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities, including microcephaly (62 infants). Eye abnormalities were present in 57 of 224 (25.4%) infants. Optic nerve (44 of 57; 77.2%) and retina abnormalities (37 of 57; 64.9%) were the most common. The group with suspected ZIKV infection (68 infants) had proportionally more eye (36.8% vs 20.5%; P = .022) and CNS abnormalities (68.3% vs 28.1%; P = .008), likely because of referral patterns. Eye abnormalities consistent with ZIKV infection were clinically comparable in both RT-PCR-positive and unconfirmed groups, including 4 RT-PCR-positive infants of 5 without any CNS abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Similar eye manifestations were identified regardless of laboratory confirmation. Well-appearing infants were also found to have eye abnormalities. Therefore, all infants born after ZIKV outbreaks should be universally screened for eye abnormalities."

In Brazil, the first reported case of ZIKV infection was in May 2015. Additionally, dengue (DENV) is endemic and there has been a recent outbreak of chikungunya (CHIKV). Since the clinical manifestations of different arboviral infections (AI) can be similar, definitive diagnosis requires laboratory testing. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV infections in a Brazilian cohort of HIV-infected pregnant women, to assess clinical/immunological characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of women with evidence of recent AI. STUDY DESIGN: Laboratory diagnosis of ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV infections utilized serological assays, RT-PCR and PRNT. The tests were performed at the first visit, 34-36 weeks of gestation and at any time if a woman had symptoms suggestive of AI. Mann-Whitney tests were used for comparison of medians, Chi-square or Fisher's to compare proportions; p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Poisson regression was used to analyze risk factors for central nervous system (CNS) malformations in the infant according to maternal symptomatology. RESULTS: Of 219 HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled, 92% were DENV IgG+; 47(22%) had laboratory evidence of recent AI. Of these, 34 (72%) were ZIKV+, nine (19%) CHIKV+, and two (4%) DENV+. Symptoms consistent with AI were observed in 23 (10%) women, of whom 10 (43%) were ZIKV+, eight (35%) CHIKV+. No CNS abnormalities were observed among infants of DENV+ or CHIKV+ women; four infants with CNS abnormalities were born to ZIKV+ women (three symptomatic). Infants born to ZIKV+ women had a higher risk of CNS malformations if the mother was symptomatic (RR = 7.20), albeit not statistically significant (p = 0.066). CONCLUSIONS: Among HIV-infected pregnant women with laboratory evidence of a recent AI, 72% were ZIKV-infected.

METHODS: A case-control design of 1:4 (1 transmitter to 4 nontransmitters) was utilized to evaluate DRMs as a predictor of HIV MTCT in specimens obtained from mother-infant pairs. ViroSeq HIV-1 genotyping was performed on mother-infant specimens to assess for clinically relevant DRMs. RESULTS: One hundred forty infants acquired HIV infection; of these, 123 mother-infant pairs (88%) had specimens successfully amplified using ViroSeq and assessed for drug resistance genotyping. Additionally, 483 of 560 (86%) women who did not transmit HIV to infants also had samples evaluated for DRMs. Sixty-three of 606 (10%) women had clinically relevant DRMs; 12 (2%) had DRMs against >1 drug class.

In univariate and multivariate analyses, DRMs in mothers were not associated with increased HIV MTCT (adjusted odds ratio, 0.8 [95% confidence interval, .4-1.5]). Presence of DRMs in transmitting mothers was strongly associated with DRM presence in their infants (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Preexisting DRMs were common in untreated HIV-infected pregnant women, but did not increase the risk of HIV MTCT. However, if women with DRMs are not virologically suppressed, they may transmit resistant mutations, thus complicating infant management."

The objective of this study was to describe the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella virus and vaccination coverage against HBV in pregnant adolescents who received care in the city of Belém, Pará, Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed with 324 pregnant adolescents from 2009 to 2010. After the interview and blood collection, the patients were screened for antibodies and/or antigens against HIV-1/2, HTLV-1/2, CMV, rubella virus and HBV. The epidemiological variables were demonstrated using descriptive statistics with the G, χ(2) and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 15.8 years, and the majority (65.4%) had less than 6 years of education. The mean age at first intercourse was 14.4 years, and 60.8% reported having a partner aged between 12 and 14 years. The prevalence of HIV infection was 0.3%, and of HTLV infection was 0.6%. Regarding HBV, 0.6% of the participants had acute infection, 9.9% had a previous infection, 16.7% had vaccine immunity and 72.8% were susceptible to infection. The presence of anti-HBs was greater in adolescent between 12 and 14 years old (28.8%) while the anti-HBc was greater in adolescent between 15 and 18 years old (10.3%). Most of the adolescents presented the IgG antibody to CMV (96.3%) and rubella (92.3%). None of the participants had acute rubella infection, and 2.2% had anti-CMV IgM. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first report of the seroepidemiology of infectious agents in a population of pregnant adolescents in the Northern region of Brazil. Most of the adolescents had low levels of education, were susceptible to HBV infection and had IgG antibodies to CMV and rubella virus.

Prenatal GBS screening of pregnant women for vaginal-rectal colonization is recommended in many countries to manage appropriate intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis for those identified as carriers. In this study, a novel melting-curve based multiplex real-time PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of GBS and macrolide and lincosamide resistance markers was developed. The usefulness of the assay was evaluated for rapid and accurate prenatal GBS screening. METHODS: One hundred two pregnant women who were at 35-37 weeks of gestation were enrolled in this study. The analytical performance of the multiplex real-time PCR was first tested using a panel of reference and clinical bacterial and fungal strains. To test the clinical performance, vaginal-rectal swabs were obtained from pregnant women who were seen at the teaching hospital for regular prenatal care. The results of real-time were compared with those obtained from microbiological analyses. RESULTS: The real-time PCR assay showed 100% specificity and a limit of detection of 10(4) colony forming units equivalent per reaction. The prevalence of GBS colonization among the population studied was 15.7% (16/102) based on a positive culture and the real-time PCR results. Agreement between the two assays was found for 11 (68.75%) GBS colonized women. Using the culture-based results as a reference, the multiplex real-time PCR had a sensitivity of 91.7% (11/12, CI 59.7-99.6%), a specificity of 95.5% (86/90, CI 89.8-98.7%), a positive predictive value of 73.3% (11/15, CI 44.8-91.1%) and a negative predictive value of 98.9% (86/87, CI 92.9-99.9%). CONCLUSION: The multiplex real-time PCR is a rapid, affordable and sensitive assay for direct detection of GBS in vaginal-rectal swabs."

Asthma-like symptoms, microbiota composition and frequencies of the total CD4+ T lymphocytes and CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells were evaluated in both groups. Probiotic administration to neonates, but not to adults, was necessary and sufficient for the absolute prevention of experimental allergen-induced sensitization. The neonatally acquired tolerance, transferrable to probiotic-untreated adult recipients by splenic cells from tolerant donors, was associated with modulation of gut bacterial composition, augmented levels of cecum butyrate and selective accumulation of Treg cells in the airways. Our findings reveal that a cross-talk between a healthy microbiota and qualitative features inherent to neonatal T cells, especially in the Treg cell subset, might support the beneficial effect of perinatal exposure to probiotic bacteria on the development of long-term tolerance to allergens."

METHODS: A cross-sectional study in Teresina, Brazil, from January to May 2015, was conducted with 366 physicians and nurses working in PNC, corresponding to 70% of eligible professionals. We evaluated 20 knowledge and practice criteria related to the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis during pregnancy with a 95% compliance standard. We performed descriptive analysis of the data and used χ(2) statistical test to verify differences according to professional category. RESULTS: Only 2 criteria, ""knowledge about mother to child transmission according to gestational age"" and ""counselling on infection,"" reached 95% compliance. Knowledge of the epidemiological profile of congenital syphilis and the goal of elimination of congenital syphilis and knowledge about serological tests had scores below 50%, while practices related with posttest counselling, cure control, and treatment of partners reached 60%. We identified organisational barriers related to the late initiation of PNC, to the delayed return of syphilis test results, to the application of benzathine penicillin in primary care units and to the treatment of partners. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies for early initiation of PNC, implementation of rapid tests for syphilis, ensuring treatment of pregnant women with penicillin, adequate partner treatment, and continued education of health professionals on clinical management and counselling in sexually transmitted diseases are necessary to eliminate congenital syphilis."

A previous study in Brazil reported an increased incidence of non-severe congenital heart defects in infants with diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome but without laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection in the mother or infant. The objective of this study is to report echocardiographic (ECHO) findings in infants with laboratory confirmed antenatal exposure to ZIKV. METHODOLOGY: Cross sectional study of cardiologic assessments of infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to ZIKV in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. RESULTS: The study enrolled 120 children with a median age of 97 days (1 to 376 days). In utero exposure to ZIKV was confirmed in 97 children (80,8%) through positive maternal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results during pregnancy or a positive PCR result at birth; 23 additional children (19.2%) had maternal positive PCR results during pregnancy and postnatally. Forty- eight infants (40%) had cardiac defects noted on ECHO. Thirteen infants (10.8%) had major cardiac defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). None of the defects were severe. The frequency of major defects was higher in infants whose mothers had a rash in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, or who had altered Central Nervous System (CNS) imaging postnatally or were preterm. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with in utero ZIKV exposure have a higher prevalence of major cardiac defects, however none were severe enough to require immediate intervention. For this reason, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow general newborn screening guidelines, which significantly reduces the burden of performing emergent fetal or neonatal ECHOs in a setting where resources are not available, such as most Brazilian municipalities."

We used cases of pregnant women infected with HIV identified in the ""Birth in Brazil"" study, and cases of AIDS in children under 5 years old identified in the NIS, to estimate the MTCT of HIV infection in the country, with a 95% confidence interval. We also estimated the HIV cascade (HIV diagnosis; use of antiretroviral treatment (ART) during pregnancy, labour, and for the newborn; adequate care during childbirth considering viral load at birth; and no breastfeeding) using data from the same sources. RESULTS: MTCT of HIV of 2.0% (95% CI 0.3%-13.8%). At birth, 84.0% of HIV infected woman showed a positive HIV diagnosis, 74.9% received combined ART during pregnancy, 80.7% received ART during childbirth, 77.1% received adequate care during childbirth, 86.8% of newborns received ART within the first 24 hours after birth, and 2.8% of newborns were breastfed.

Methods: Animals were infected with T. cruzi H4 strain (TcI lineage) before gestation (IBG) or during gestation (IDG). Tissue and sera samples of dams and fetuses were obtained near parturition. Results: All IBG and IDG dams were seropositive by two tests, and exhibited blood parasite load of 1.62±2.2 and 50.1±62 parasites/μl, respectively, by quantitative PCR. Histological evaluation showed muscle fiber degeneration and cellular necrosis in all infected dams. Parasite nests were not detected in infected dams by histology. However, qPCR analysis detected parasites-eq/g heart tissue of 153±104.7 and 169.3±129.4 in IBG and IDG dams, respectively. All fetuses of infected dams were positive for anti-parasite IgG antibodies and tissue parasites by qPCR, but presented a low level of tissue inflammatory infiltrate. Fetuses of IDG (vs. IBG) dams exhibited higher degree of muscle fiber degeneration and cellular necrosis in the heart and skeletal tissues. The placental tissue exhibited no inflammatory lesions and amastigote nests, yet parasites-eq/g of 381.2±34.3 and 79.2±84.9 were detected in IDG and IBG placentas, respectively. Fetal development was compromised, and evidenced by a decline in weight, crow-rump length, and abdominal width in both groups. Conclusions: T. cruzi TcI has a high capacity of congenital transmission even when it was inoculated at a very low dose before or during gestation. Tissue lesions, parasite load, and fetal under development provide evidence for high virulence of the parasite during pregnancy. Despite finding of high parasite burden by qPCR, placentas were protected from cellular damage. Our studies offer an experimental model to study the efficacy of vaccines and drugs against congenital transmission of T. cruzi. These results also call for T. cruzi screening in pregnant women and adequate follow up of the newborns in endemic areas. © 2018 Torres-Vargas et al."

Brain tissue samples were collected from 15 cases, including 10 microcephalic ZIKV-positive neonates with fatal outcome and five neonatal control flavivirus-negative neonates that died due to other causes, but with preserved central nervous system (CNS) architecture. In microcephaly cases, the histopathological features of the tissue samples were characterized in three CNS areas (meninges, perivascular space, and parenchyma). The changes found were mainly calcification, necrosis, neuronophagy, gliosis, microglial nodules, and inflammatory infiltration of mononuclear cells. The in situ immune response against ZIKV in the CNS of newborns is complex. Despite the predominant expression of Th2 cytokines, other cytokines such as Th1, Th17, Treg, Th9, and Th22 are involved to a lesser extent, but are still likely to participate in the immunopathogenic mechanisms of neural disease in fatal cases of microcephaly caused by ZIKV."

METHODS: This is a descriptive study on the linkage of Brazilian databases with primary data from the ""Nascer no Brasil"" study and secondary database collection from national health information systems. The ""Nascer no Brasil"" is a national-based study carried out in 2011-2012 with 23,894 pregnant women, which identified HIV-infected pregnant women using prenatal and medical records. We searched for cases of HIV-infected pregnant women identified in the ""Nascer no Brasil"" study in the Information System of Notifiable Diseases, the Control System for Laboratory Tests of the National CD4+/CD8+ Lymphocyte Count and HIV Viral Load Network, and the Logistics Control System for Medications. We used the OpenRecLink software for the linkage of databases. We estimated the notification coverage, with the respective confidence interval, of the evaluated Brazilian health information systems. RESULTS: We estimated the coverage of the reporting of HIV-infected pregnant women in the Information System of Notifiable Diseases as 57.1% (95%CI 42.9-70.2), and we located 89.3% of the HIV-infected pregnant women (95%CI 81.2-94.2) in some of the Brazilian health information systems researched.

ZIKV cases markedly declined in February 2016, which coincided with the start of a CHIKV outbreak. Rainfall predicted ZIKV and CHIKV with a lead time of 3 weeks each time. The association between rainfall and epidemics reflects vector ecology as the larval stages of Aedes aegypti require pools of water to develop.

We report the characterization of monoclonal antibody pairs that have been translated into rapid immunochromatography tests to specifically detect the viral nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein antigen and distinguish the four DENV serotypes (DENV1-4) and ZIKV without cross-reaction. To complement visual test analysis and remove user subjectivity in reading test results, we used image processing and data analysis for data capture and test result quantification. Using a 30-μl serum sample, the sensitivity and specificity values of the DENV1-4 tests and the pan-DENV test, which detects all four dengue serotypes, ranged from 0.76 to 1.00. Sensitivity/specificity for the ZIKV rapid test was 0.81/0.86, respectively, using a 150-μl serum input. Serum ZIKV NS1 protein concentrations were about 10-fold lower than corresponding DENV NS1 concentrations in infected patients; moreover, ZIKV NS1 protein was not detected in polymerase chain reaction-positive patient urine samples. Our rapid immunochromatography approach and reagents have immediate application in differential clinical diagnosis of acute ZIKV and DENV cases, and the platform can be applied toward developing rapid antigen diagnostics for emerging viruses."

METHODS: A literature search was performed using PubMed, SciELO and Google Scholar and throughout collected articles' references. Narrative analysis was structured around five main themes identified: vector transmission, control programme, transfusion, oral and congenital transmission. RESULTS: In Brazil, the Chagas' Disease Control Programme was fully implemented in the 1980s, when it reached practically all the endemic areas, and in 1991, the Southern Cone Initiative was created, aiming to control the disease transmission through eliminating the Triatoma infestans and controlling blood banks. As a result, the prevalence of chagasic donors in blood banks reduced from 4.4% in the 1980s to 0.2% in 2005. In 2006, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) certified the interruption of transmission of ChD through this vector in Brazil. However, there are still challenges, such as the domiciliation of new vector species, the need for medical care of the infected individuals, the prevention of alternative mechanisms of transmission, the loss of political concern regarding the disease and the weakening of the control programme. CONCLUSION: Despite the progress towards control, there are still many challenges ahead to maintain and expand such control and minimise the risk of re-emergence."

This review discusses current malaria data, policies and challenges in four South American Amazon countries: Brazil, Colombia, Peru and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Challenges to continuing efforts to further decrease malaria incidence in this region include: a significant increase in malaria cases in recent years in Venezuela, evidence of submicroscopic and asymptomatic infections, peri-urban malaria, gold mining-related malaria, malaria in pregnancy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and primaquine use, and possible under-detection of Plasmodium malariae. Some of these challenges underscore the need to implement appropriate tools and procedures in specific regions, such as a field-compatible molecular malaria test, a P. malariae-specific test, malaria diagnosis and appropriate treatment as part of regular antenatal care visits, G6PD test before primaquine administration for P. vivax cases (with weekly primaquine regimen for G6PD deficient individuals), single low dose of primaquine for P. falciparum malaria in Colombia, and national and regional efforts to contain malaria spread in Venezuela urgently needed especially in mining areas.

The detection of suspected cases by the surveillance system depends on the case definition adopted. As the laboratory diagnosis of Zika infection still relies on the use of expensive and complex molecular techniques with low sensitivity due to a narrow window of detection, most suspected cases are not confirmed by laboratory tests, mainly reserved for pregnant women and newborns. In this context, an accurate definition of a suspected Zika case is crucial in order for the surveillance system to gauge the magnitude of an epidemic. METHODOLOGY: We evaluated the accuracy of various Zika case definitions in a scenario where Dengue and Chikungunya viruses co-circulate. Signs and symptoms that best discriminated PCR confirmed Zika from other laboratory confirmed febrile or exanthematic diseases were identified to propose and test predictive models for Zika infection based on these clinical features. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our derived score prediction model had the best performance because it demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity, 86·6% and 78·3%, respectively. This Zika case definition also had the highest values for auROC (0·903) and R2 (0·417), and the lowest Brier score 0·096. CONCLUSIONS: In areas where multiple arboviruses circulate, the presence of rash with pruritus or conjunctival hyperemia, without any other general clinical manifestations such as fever, petechia or anorexia is the best Zika case definition."

OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients with Chagas disease, younger than 18 years, who had undergone pacemaker implantation in Brazil between 1994 and 2011, and its temporal trend. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Brazilian Pacemaker Registry database. The following variables were analyzed: year when pacemaker was implanted, location, age, sex, ethnic group, functional class and the main electrocardiographic findings at baseline. RESULTS: In a total of 183,123 implants performed between 1994 and 2011, 214 implants of cardiac stimulation device in Chagas disease patients aged younger than 18 years were identified. Mean age at implantation was 5.6 ± 6.2 years. Second- and third-degree atrioventricular blocks corresponded to 71% of indications for pacemaker implantation. Fifty-six percent of the procedures were performed in the southeast region. Regarding the total number of pacemaker implants per year, there was a remarkable increase in the implants for all causes. However, time series analysis of the implants in Chagas disease patients younger than 18 years revealed a significant reduction in the annual number of implants. CONCLUSION: There has been an important reduction in the number of pacemaker implantations among children and adolescents with Chagas disease, suggesting a reduction in the vertical transmission of the parasite.

We hypothesized that first trimester 25(OH)D inadequacy is associated with lower concentrations of HDL-c and higher LDL-c, TC, TG, TG/HDL-c, and TC/HDL-c ratios throughout pregnancy. METHODS: A prospective cohort study with 3 visits at 5-13 (baseline), 20-26, and 30-36 gestational weeks, recruited 194 pregnant women attending a public health care center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Plasma 25(OH)D concentrations were measured in the first trimester using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 25(OH)D concentrations were classified as adequate (≥75nmol/L) or inadequate (<75nmol/L). Serum TC, HDL-c, and TG concentrations were measured enzymatically. Crude and adjusted longitudinal linear mixed-effects models were employed to evaluate the association between the first trimester 25(OH)D status and changes in serum lipid concentrations throughout pregnancy. Confounders adjusted for in the multiple analysis were age, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA), early pregnancy BMI, leisure time physical activity before pregnancy, energy intake, and gestational age. RESULTS: At baseline, 69% of the women had inadequate concentrations of 25(OH)D. Women with 25(OH)D inadequacy had higher mean LDL-c than those with adequate concentrations (91.3 vs. 97.5mg/dL; P=0.064) at baseline. TC, HDL-c, LDL-c TG, TG/HDL-c ratios, and TC/HDL-c ratios, increased throughout pregnancy independently of 25(OH)D concentrations (ANOVA for repeated measures P<0.001). The adjusted models showed direct associations between the first trimester 25(OH)D status and changes in TC (β=9.53; 95%CI=1.12-17.94), LDL-c (β=9.99; 95% CI=3.62-16.36) concentrations, and TC/HDL-c ratios (β=0.16; 95% CI=0.01-0.31) throughout pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Inadequate plasma 25(OH)D concentrations during early pregnancy were associated with more pronounced changes of TC, LDL-c concentrations, and TC/HDL-c ratios throughout pregnancy. Changes in these cardiovascular markers suggest the importance of ensuring adequate vitamin D status at the beginning of pregnancy."

OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of aβ2GP1-Dm1 in a cohort of patients with thrombotic APS, and to evaluate whether testing for aβ2GP1-Dm1 could have a clinical impact upon the risk assessment of the disease. METHODS: Patients were tested for aβ2GP1-Dm1 antibodies by chemiluminescence (BioFlash/AcuStar®, ES). The presence of aβ2GP1-Dm1 was evaluated in different clinical presentations of the disease. RESULTS: Eight-four patients with a history of venous or arterial thrombosis were included. Forty-five (54%) patients had aβ2GP1 antibodies and 40% of them were positive for aβ2GP1-Dm1. Levels of aβ2GP1-Dm1 were higher in patients with systemic autoimmune disease (AUC=0.665; 95% CI=0.544-0.786; P=0.01), positive antinuclear antibody (AUC=0.654; 95% CI=0.535-0.772; P=0.01), triple antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) positivity (AUC=0.680; 95% CI=0.534-0.825; P=0.02) and positive lupus anticoagulant (AUC=0.639; 95% CI=0.502-0.776; P=0.07). In this cohort, aβ2GP1-Dm1 antibodies were not associated with the site of the first thrombosis (OR=0,62, 95% CI=0.20-1.94, P=0.42), thrombosis recurrence (OR=1.0, 95% CI=0.37-2.71, P=1.0) or pregnancy morbidity (OR=1.5, 95% CI=0.33-7.34, P=0.58). In multivariate analysis, positivity for aβ2GP1-Dm1 antibodies was associated with the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune disease (OR=4.01, 95% CI=1.14-14.2; P=0.03) and triple aPL positivity (OR=3.59, 95% CI=0.87-14.85; P=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: In the present cohort of thrombotic-APS patients, aβ2GP1-Dm1 antibodies were related to the diagnosis of systemic autoimmunity and complex serological profile of the disease, as triple aPL positivity and positive antinuclear antibody.

Univariate logistic regression was performed to verify factors associated with congenital syphilis. Estimated incidence of congenital syphilis was 3.51 per 1,000 live births (95%CI: 2.29-5.37) and vertical transmission rate was 34.3% (95%CI: 24.7-45.4). Congenital syphilis was associated with lower maternal schooling, black skin color, higher rate of risk factors for prematurity, late initiation of prenatal care, fewer prenatal visits, and lower rate of prenatal serological testing. Fetal mortality was six times higher in congenital syphilis, and newborns with congenital syphilis showed higher hospital admission rates. Congenital syphilis is a persistent public health problem in Brazil and is associated with greater social vulnerability and gaps in prenatal care."

Of these, 27 (79 %) animals were symptomatic. Leishmania was detected in the mammary glands of 13 (65 %) females. L. infantum was isolated for the first time from the seminal fluid and uterus of naturally infected dogs. The parasite burden and intensity of the inflammatory reaction were greater in the prepuce and glans of males and in the vulva and mammary glands of females. In addition to inflammation, testicular degeneration, atrophy, absence of spermatogenesis, and necrosis were observed. Detection of amastigote forms in the mammary gland lumen indicates possible elimination of this parasite in milk. The frequent parasitism observed in the genital tract of infected males and females and the viability of L. infantum in seminal fluid and uterus suggest the possibility of bidirectional venereal and vertical transmission."

Congenital microcephaly is associated with genetic factors and several causative agents. Epidemiological data suggest that microcephaly cases in Brazil might be associated with the introduction of Zika virus. We aimed to detect and sequence the Zika virus genome in amniotic fluid samples of two pregnant women in Brazil whose fetuses were diagnosed with microcephaly. METHODS: In this case study, amniotic fluid samples from two pregnant women from the state of Paraíba in Brazil whose fetuses had been diagnosed with microcephaly were obtained, on the recommendation of the Brazilian health authorities, by ultrasound-guided transabdominal amniocentesis at 28 weeks' gestation. The women had presented at 18 weeks' and 10 weeks' gestation, respectively, with clinical manifestations that could have been symptoms of Zika virus infection, including fever, myalgia, and rash. After the amniotic fluid samples were centrifuged, DNA and RNA were extracted from the purified virus particles before the viral genome was identified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic reconstruction and investigation of recombination events were done by comparing the Brazilian Zika virus genome with sequences from other Zika strains and from flaviviruses that occur in similar regions in Brazil. FINDINGS: We detected the Zika virus genome in the amniotic fluid of both pregnant women. The virus was not detected in their urine or serum. Tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, HIV, Treponema pallidum, and parvovirus B19 were all negative. After sequencing of the complete genome of the Brazilian Zika virus isolated from patient 1, phylogenetic analyses showed that the virus shares 97-100% of its genomic identity with lineages isolated during an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013, and that in both envelope and NS5 genomic regions, it clustered with sequences from North and South America, southeast Asia, and the Pacific. After assessing the possibility of recombination events between the Zika virus and other flaviviruses, we ruled out the hypothesis that the Brazilian Zika virus genome is a recombinant strain with other mosquito-borne flaviviruses. INTERPRETATION: These findings strengthen the putative association between Zika virus and cases of microcephaly in neonates in Brazil. Moreover, our results suggest that the virus can cross the placental barrier. As a result, Zika virus should be considered as a potential infectious agent for human fetuses. Pathogenesis studies that confirm the tropism of Zika virus for neuronal cells are warranted.

We observed chronic placentitis (TORCH type) with viral protein detection by immunohistochemistry in Hofbauer cells and some histiocytes in the intervillous spaces. We also demonstrated the neurotropism of the virus via the detection of viral proteins in glial cells and in some endothelial cells and the observation of scattered foci of microcalcifications in the brain tissues. Lesions were mainly located in the white matter. ZIKV RNA was also detected in these tissues by real-time-polymerase chain reaction.

We performed next-generation sequencing to generate seven Brazilian ZIKV genomes sampled from four self-limited cases, one blood donor, one fatal adult case, and one newborn with microcephaly and congenital malformations. Results of phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses show a single introduction of ZIKV into the Americas, which we estimated to have occurred between May and December 2013, more than 12 months before the detection of ZIKV in Brazil. The estimated date of origin coincides with an increase in air passengers to Brazil from ZIKV-endemic areas, as well as with reported outbreaks in the Pacific Islands. ZIKV genomes from Brazil are phylogenetically interspersed with those from other South American and Caribbean countries. Mapping mutations onto existing structural models revealed the context of viral amino acid changes present in the outbreak lineage; however, no shared amino acid changes were found among the three currently available virus genomes from microcephaly cases. Municipality-level incidence data indicate that reports of suspected microcephaly in Brazil best correlate with ZIKV incidence around week 17 of pregnancy, although this correlation does not demonstrate causation. Our genetic description and analysis of ZIKV isolates in Brazil provide a baseline for future studies of the evolution and molecular epidemiology of this emerging virus in the Americas."

Previous studies have evaluated the genetic susceptibility to Chagas disease in humans, including the polymorphisms of cytokine genes, demonstrating correlations between the genetic polymorphism and cardiomyopathy development in the chronic phase. However, the relationship between the galectin-3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and phenotypic variations in Chagas disease has not been evaluated. Objective: The present study aimed to determine whether genetic polymorphisms of galectin-3 may predispose to the development of cardiac forms of Chagas disease. Methods: Fifty-five subjects with Chagas disease were enrolled in this observational study. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for genotyping the variants rs4644 and rs4652 of the galectin-3 gene. Results: For the SNP rs4644, the relative risk for the cardiac form was not associated with the genotypes AA (OR = 0.79, p = 0.759), AC (OR = 4.38, p = 0.058), or CC (OR = 0.39, p = 0.127).

In this study, we explore T. cruzi infection multiclonality in the context of age, sex and clinical profile among a cohort of chronic patients, as well as paired congenital cases from Cochabamba, Bolivia and Goias, Brazil using amplicon deep sequencing technology. METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A 450bp fragment of the trypomastigote TcGP63I surface protease gene was amplified and sequenced across 70 chronic and 22 congenital cases on the Illumina MiSeq platform. In addition, a second, mitochondrial target--ND5--was sequenced across the same cohort of cases. Several million reads were generated, and sequencing read depths were normalized within patient cohorts (Goias chronic, n = 43, Goias congenital n = 2, Bolivia chronic, n = 27; Bolivia congenital, n = 20), Among chronic cases, analyses of variance indicated no clear correlation between intra-host sequence diversity and age, sex or symptoms, while principal coordinate analyses showed no clustering by symptoms between patients. Between congenital pairs, we found evidence for the transmission of multiple sequence types from mother to infant, as well as widespread instances of novel genotypes in infants. Finally, non-synonymous to synonymous (dn:ds) nucleotide substitution ratios among sequences of TcGP63Ia and TcGP63Ib subfamilies within each cohort provided powerful evidence of strong diversifying selection at this locus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results shed light on the diversity of parasite DTUs within each patient, as well as the extent to which parasite strains pass between mother and foetus in congenital cases. Although we were unable to find any evidence that parasite diversity accumulates with age in our study cohorts, putative diversifying selection within members of the TcGP63I gene family suggests a link between genetic diversity within this gene family and survival in the mammalian host."

Endemic areas exhibit wide variations regarding severe disease frequency. This study, conducted simultaneously in Brazil and India, constitutes, to our knowledge, the first multisite study focused on clinical characterization of P. vivax severe disease. METHODS: Patients admitted with P. vivax mono-infection at reference centers in Manaus (Amazon - Brazil) and Bikaner (Rajasthan - India), where P. vivax predominates, were submitted to standard thorough clinical and laboratory evaluations in order to characterize clinical manifestations and identify concurrent co-morbidities. RESULTS: In total, 778 patients (88.0% above 12 years old) were hospitalized at clinical discretion with PCR-confirmed P. vivax mono-infection (316 in Manaus and 462 in Bikaner), of which 197 (25.3%) presented at least one severity criterion as defined by the World Health Organization (2010). Hyperlactatemia, respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation were more frequent in Manaus. Noteworthy, pregnancy status was associated as a risk factor for severe disease (OR = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.2-3.4; P = 0.007). The overall case fatality rate was 0.3/1,000 cases in Manaus and 6.1/1,000 cases in Bikaner, with all deaths occurring among patients fulfilling at least one severity criterion. Within this subgroup, case fatality rates increased respectively to 7.5% in Manaus and 4.4% in Bikaner. CONCLUSION: P. vivax-associated severity is not negligible, and although lethality observed for complicated cases was similar, the overall fatality rate was about 20-fold higher in India compared to Brazil, highlighting the variability observed in different settings.

For this purpose, infected/uninfected BeWo cells were treated with IL10, TGFB1 (50 ng/ml), and IFNG (20 or 100 ng/ml) in order to verify the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1), STAT3, and Smad2, parasite intracellular proliferation, as well as the Th1/Th2/IL17A cytokine production. The treatment of BeWo cells with IL10 and TGFB1 favored T. gondii proliferation, and these findings were associated with STAT3 and Smad2 phosphorylation, respectively (P < 0.05). Also, these cytokine treatments were able to down-modulate TNF alpha (TNFA) and IL6 production (P < 0.05). Low concentration of IFNG was unable to control T. gondii infection but was able to trigger STAT1 phosphorylation and up-regulate IL6 and IL17A production; whereas a high concentration of IFNG was unable to activate STAT1 but down-modulated IL6 and TNFA and increased T. gondii proliferation (P < 0.05).

Pregnant women are susceptible to the same adverse reactions to ARVs as nonpregnant adults as well as to specific pregnancy-related reactions. In addition, we should consider adverse pregnancy outcomes and adverse reactions in children exposed to ARVs during intrauterine life. However, studies designed to assess the safety of ARV in pregnant women are rare, usually with few participants and short follow-up periods. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we discuss studies reporting adverse reactions to ARV drugs, including maternal toxicity, adverse pregnancy outcomes and the consequences of exposure to ARV in infants. We included results of observational studies, both prospective and retrospective, as well as randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. EXPERT OPINION: The benefits of ARV use during pregnancy outweigh the risks of adverse reactions identified to date. More studies are needed to assess the adverse effects in the medium- and long term in children exposed to ARVs during pregnancy, as well as pregnant women using lifelong antiretroviral therapy and more recently available drugs."

There is evidence that patients with Chagas heart disease have lower Se levels than healthy individuals and patients with T. cruzi infection without of cardiac disease. The aim of this investigation is to estimate the effect of Se treatment on prevention of heart disease progression in patients with chagasic cardiopathy.Methods: The Selenium Treatment and Chagasic Cardiopathy trial is a superiority, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. The eligibility criteria are as follows: (1) a Chagas disease diagnosis confirmed by serology; (2) segmental, mild or moderate global left ventricular systolic dysfunction; and (3) age between 18 and 65 years. The exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) pregnancy, (2) diabetes mellitus, (3) tobacco use, (4) alcohol abuse, (5) evidence of nonchagasic heart disease, (6) depression, (7) dysphagia with evidence of food residues in the esophagus, (8) dysphagia with weight loss higher than 15% of usual weight in the last four months and/or (9) conditions that may result in low protocol adherence. The intervention will be 100 μg of sodium selenite once daily for 365 consecutive days compared to placebo. The following are the primary outcomes to be measured: (1) the trajectories of the left ventricular ejection fraction in the follow-up period; (2) reduction of heart disease progression rates, with progression defined as a 10% decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction; and (3) rate of hospital admissions attributable to dysrhythmia, heart failure or stroke due to Chagas disease. One hundred thirty patients will be randomly allocated into either the intervention or placebo group at a ratio of 1:1. The sequence allocation concealment and blinding were planned to be conducted with the strategy of numbered boxes. Both patients and health-care providers will remain blinded to the intervention groups during the 5 years of follow-up.Discussion: If Se treatment reduces the progression of Chagas cardiopathy, the inclusion of this micronutrient in the daily diet can improve the therapeutic regimen for this neglected tropical disease at low cost.Trial registration: Clinical Trials.gov ID: NCT00875173 (registered 20 October 20 2008). © 2014 Alvarenga Americano do Brasil et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

METHODS: We searched electronic databases, grey literature and reference lists of included publications to identify epidemiological studies on the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women and on the congenital transmission rate of T. cruzi infection in Brazil published between January 1980 and June 2013. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using fixed- and random-effects models. RESULTS: Sixteen articles were included - 12 studies on the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women (549,359 pregnant women) and nine on congenital transmission rates (1687 children born to infected mothers). Prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women ranged from 0.1% to 8.5%, and congenital transmission rates from 0% to 5.2%. The pooled prevalence of Chagas disease among pregnant women across studies was 1.1% (95% CI: 0.6-2.0); the pooled congenital transmission rate was 1.7% (95% CI: 0.9-3.1). In 2010, 34,629 pregnant women were estimated to be infected with T. cruzi, and 312-1073 children born (mean: 589 cases) with congenital infection. CONCLUSION: Congenital Chagas disease is a neglected public health problem in Brazil. Systematic congenital Chagas disease control programs through routine prenatal screening for T. cruzi should be widely implemented in Brazil's endemic areas, to identify infected pregnant women and newborns at risk of congenital infection."

A prospective study was carried out from February 2005 to May 2006. Women were classified according to their ART status during pregnancy diagnosis: ARV-experienced (ARTexp) or ARV-naïve (ARTn). Two hundred fourteen HIV-infected pregnant women were included: 36 ARTexp and 178 ARTn. ARTexp women have not experienced ADR. Among ARTn, 20.2% presented ADR. Incidence rate of ADR was 70.8 per 1000 person-months and the most common ADRs observed were: gastrointestinal (belly or abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea and vomit) in 16.3%, cutaneous (pruritus and rash) in 6.2%, anemia (2.2%) and hepatitis (1.7%). The frequency of obstetrical complications, pre-term delivery, low birth weight and birth abnormalities was low in this population. ADRs ranged from mild to moderate intensity, none of them being potentially fatal. Only in a few cases it was necessary to discontinue ART.

The worst prognosis and the progression of this cardiomyopathy are associated with an exacerbated immune response and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which also occur in other cardiomyopathies. Some nutrients, including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), promote the inhibition and/or stimulation of cytokine production. The objective of this trial is to study the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on the inflammatory response and lipid profile in patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial with 40 patients that will be conducted at a reference unit for Chagas disease patients, where the patients will be selected. The study will include patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy who are 18 years of age or older. The exclusion criteria are (a) ongoing diarrheal disease, (b) inflammatory bowel disease, (c) diabetes or other endocrine disease, (d) use of fibrates, niacin, or statins, (e) use of anti-inflammatory drugs, (f) pregnant and lactating women, (g) use of vitamin, mineral, or omega-3 supplementation during the previous 30 days, (h) hospital admission during the study, and (i) other associated cardiomyopathies. The intervention will be treatment with omega-3 PUFAs at a dose of 3 g/day for 8 weeks, compared to placebo (corn oil). The primary endpoints will be the concentrations of inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, interferon (IFN)γ, and transforming growth factor (TGF)β). Secondary endpoints will be the fasting glucose, lipid, and anthropometric profiles. For statistical analysis, we plan to run either a t test or Wilcoxon test (numerical variables) and Pearson's χ2 or Fisher's exact test (categorical data), as appropriate. DISCUSSION: Evidence suggests that the anti-inflammatory action of omega-3 PUFAs may have beneficial effects on chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, as shown for other cardiomyopathies, due to improved control of the inflammatory response. At the end of the study, we predict that patients will have lower inflammatory markers and an improved metabolic and anthropometric profile.

To estimate the severity of maternal dengue infection, the available data that were compiled from January 2007 to December 2008 by the official surveillance information system of the city of Rio de Janeiro were reviewed. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the study period, 151,604 cases of suspected dengue infection were reported. Five hundred sixty-one women in their reproductive age (15-49 years) presented with dengue infection; 99 (18.1%) pregnant and 447 (81.9%) non-pregnant women were analyzed. Dengue cases were categorized using the 1997 WHO classification system, and DHF/DSS were considered severe disease. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare maternal age, according to gestational period, and severity of disease. A chi-square test was utilized to evaluate the differences in the proportion of dengue severity between pregnant and non-pregnant women. Univariate analysis was performed to compare outcome variables (severe dengue and non-severe dengue) and explanatory variables (pregnancy, gestational age and trimester) using the Wald test. A multivariate analysis was performed to assess the independence of statistically significant variables in the univariate analysis. A p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. A higher percentage of severe dengue infection among pregnant women was found, p = 0.0001. Final analysis demonstrated that pregnant women are 3.4 times more prone to developing severe dengue (OR: 3.38; CI: 2.10-5.42). Mortality among pregnant women was superior to non-pregnant women. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women have an increased risk of developing severe dengue infection and dying of dengue."

T. cruzi infection was confirmed in mothers through positive serology in two different tests, and infected mothers were required to have their infants serologically tested after the age of 6 months. The birth conditions of the neonates were obtained from the System of Information on Live Births database. RESULTS: The study included 407 children born to T. cruzi-infected mothers and 407 children born to uninfected mothers. The average age of seropositive mothers was 32 years (CI95% 31.3-32.6), which was greater than the average age of seronegative mothers - 25 years (CI95% 24.8-25.2). The mothers' level of education was higher among uninfected mothers (41% had 8 or more years of education, versus 22% between the infected mothers).

Pregnant women diagnosed with syphilis were identified through interviews, checking their antenatal care card and searching for reported cases in the public health information systems. Cases of congenital syphilis were sought at the disease reporting system (Sinan), the Mortality Information System (SIM) and the SUS's Hospital Information System (SIH). RESULTS: Syphilis was identified in 46 of the pregnancies, and 16 cases of congenital syphilis were identified, resulting in a prevalence of 1.9% (95%CI 1.3;2.6) of syphilis in pregnancy and an incidence of 6/1,000 (95%CI 3;12/1,000) of congenital syphilis. The vertical transmission rate was 34.8% with three cases resulting in death (1 abortion, 1 stillborn and 1 neonatal death) and high proportions of prematurity and low birth weight. The healthcare pathway of those women revealed flaws in the care they received, such as late entry to antenatal care, syphilis remaining undiagnosed during pregnancy and lack of treatment for the partner. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative strategies are needed to improve the outcomes of syphilis in pregnancy, including improving the laboratory network, the quality of care delivered to the pregnant women and their sexual partners and, most important of all, investigating every case of congenital syphilis as a sentinel event in the quality of antenatal care."

CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence of HTLV infection in pregnant women assisted in basic health units from the State of Pará, Northern Brazil, was 0.3% similar to those described in other Brazilian studies. The variables related to infection were important indicators in identifying pregnant women with a higher tendency to HTLV seropositivity, being a strategy for disease control and prevention, avoiding vertical transmission."

Many cases could be prevented by simple precautions during pregnancy. Aiming to assess the knowledge about toxoplasmosis among professionals working in antenatal care in a high prevalent region, a questionnaire was administered to 118 obstetric nurses and physicians attending at primary care units and hospitals. The questionnaire was self-completed and included questions on diagnosis, clinical issues, and prevention. Only 44% of total answers were corrected. Lower scores were observed among those with over 10 years of graduation, working in primary care units, and nurses. Errors were mainly observed in questions of prevention and diagnosis. As congenital toxoplasmosis is a mother-to-child (MTC) transmitted disease, early diagnosis and treatment can prevent serious and irreversible fetal damage. Thus, doctors and nurses who provide prenatal care must be appropriately trained on prophylactic, diagnostic, and clinical aspects of toxoplasmosis. The authors suggest that measures should be taken for continuing education regarding toxoplasmosis in pregnancy."

Blood on filter paper was collected from 104,954 children and screened in a single laboratory with two serological tests: indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme linked immunoassay. All samples with positive or indetermined results, as well as 10% of all the negative samples were submitted to a quality control reference laboratory, which performed both tests a second time, as well as the western blot assay of TESA (Trypomastigote Excreted Secreted Antigen). All children with confirmed final positive result (n = 104, prevalence = 0.1%) had a follow-up visit and were submitted to a second blood collection, this time a whole blood sample. In addition, blood samples from the respective mothers and familiar members were collected. The infection was confirmed in only 32 (0.03%) of those children. From them, 20 (0.025%) had maternal positive results, suggesting congenital transmission; 11 (0.01%) had non-infected mothers, indicating a possible vectorial transmission; and in one whose mother had died the transmission mechanism could not be elucidated. In further 41 visited children the infection was confirmed only in their mothers, suggesting passive transference of maternal antibodies; in other 18, both child and mother were negative; and in 13 cases both were not localized. The 11 children that acquired the infection presumably through the vector were distributed mainly in the Northeast region of Brazil (States of Piauí, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba and Alagoas), in addition to one case in Amazonas (North region) and another in Parana (South region). Remarkably, 60% of the 20 cases of probably congenital transmission were from a single State, Rio Grande do Sul, with the remaining cases distributed in other states. This is the first report demonstrating regional geographical differences in the vertical transmission of Chagas disease in Brazil, which probably reflects the predominant Trypanosoma cruzi group IId and IIe (now TcV and TcVI) found in this state. Overall, these results show that the regular and systematic control programs against the transmission of Chagas disease, together with socioeconomic changes observed in Brazil in the last decades, interrupted the vectorial transmission in Brazil, resumed in the few cases found in this national survey. Furthermore they reinforce the need for maintenance of control programs for the consolidation of this major advance in public health."

METHODS: Clinical event rates after postpartum HAART discontinuation were calculated for all WHO stage 2-3 events, as well as for HIV progression warranting HAART re-initiation, defined by a WHO stage 4 event and/or CD4(+) T-cell decrease to ≤200 cells/mm(3). Predictors of the WHO stage 2-3 events and HIV progression outcomes were evaluated with Cox's proportional hazards models. RESULTS: A total of 120 women were followed for a mean of 1.5 years after delivery. Overall, 26 women had 30 events as follows: 20 developed WHO stage 2-3 events, yielding an incidence rate of 13/100 person-years (PY; 95% CI 8-20); 10 developed HIV progression requiring HAART re-initiation (incidence ratio 6/100 PY, 95% CI 3-11). Among progressors, a single woman developed a WHO stage 4 clinical event and the remainder had CD4(+) T-cell decreases. Women who had baseline CD4(+) T-cell counts between 200-500 cells/mm(3) had a hazard ratio for WHO stage 2-3 events of 2.5 compared to women with baseline ≥500 cells/mm(3) (95% CI 1.0-6.3; P=0.05).

A cluster found by an algorithm often spreads through large portions of the map, impacting its geographical meaning. Penalized likelihood methods for Kulldorff's spatial scan statistics have been used to control the excessive freedom of the shape of clusters. Penalty functions based on cluster geometry and non-connectivity have been proposed recently. Another approach involves the use of a multi-objective algorithm to maximize two objectives: the spatial scan statistics and the geometric penalty function. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: We present a novel scan statistic algorithm employing a function based on the graph topology to penalize the presence of under-populated disconnection nodes in candidate clusters, the disconnection nodes cohesion function. A disconnection node is defined as a region within a cluster, such that its removal disconnects the cluster. By applying this function, the most geographically meaningful clusters are sifted through the immense set of possible irregularly shaped candidate cluster solutions. To evaluate the statistical significance of solutions for multi-objective scans, a statistical approach based on the concept of attainment function is used. In this paper we compared different penalized likelihoods employing the geometric and non-connectivity regularity functions and the novel disconnection nodes cohesion function. We also build multi-objective scans using those three functions and compare them with the previous penalized likelihood scans. An application is presented using comprehensive state-wide data for Chagas' disease in puerperal women in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. CONCLUSIONS: We show that, compared to the other single-objective algorithms, multi-objective scans present better performance, regarding power, sensitivity and positive predicted value. The multi-objective non-connectivity scan is faster and better suited for the detection of moderately irregularly shaped clusters. The multi-objective cohesion scan is most effective for the detection of highly irregularly shaped clusters."

METHODS: Study based on a convenience sample of women unaware of their HIV serostatus when they were admitted to delivery in public maternity hospitals in Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre, Brazil, between March 2000 and April 2002. Women were counseled and tested using the Determine HIV1/2 Rapid Test. HIV infection was confirmed using the Brazilian algorithm for HIV infection diagnosis. In utero transmission of HIV was determined using HIV-DNA-PCR. There were performed descriptive analyses of sociodemographic data, number of previous pregnancies and abortions, number of prenatal care visits, timing of HIV testing, HIV rapid test result, neonatal and mother-to-child transmission interventions, by city studied. RESULTS: HIV prevalence in women was 6.5% (N=1,439) in Porto Alegre and 1.3% (N=3.778) in Rio de Janeiro. In Porto Alegre most of women were tested during labor (88.7%), while in Rio de Janeiro most were tested in the postpartum (67.5%). One hundred and forty-four infants were born to 143 HIV-infected women. All newborns but one in each city received at least prophylaxis with oral zidovudine. It was possible to completely avoid newborn exposure to breast milk in 96.8% and 51.1% of the cases in Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro, respectively. Injectable intravenous zidovudine was administered during labor to 68.8% and 27.7% newborns in Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro, respectively. Among those from whom blood samples were collected within 48 hours of birth, in utero transmission of HIV was confirmed in 4 cases in Rio de Janeiro (4/47) and 6 cases in Porto Alegre (6/79). CONCLUSIONS: The strategy proved feasible in maternity hospitals in Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre. Efforts must be taken to maximize HIV testing during labor. There is a need of strong social support to provide this population access to health care services after hospital discharge."

Although successful vector-control strategies have decreased the incidence of Chagas disease in several Latin American countries, both migration to urban areas and immigration have spread the disease worldwide; and now, blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and vertical transmission are a concern. The pathogenesis of Chagas cardiomyopathy involves complex host-parasite interactions, where low-grade but incessant systemic infection and triggered autoimmune reaction are the main mechanisms for its development, with the contribution of autonomic damage and microvascular disturbances. Chagas cardiomyopathy is the most important clinical presentation of Chagas disease and comprises a wide range of manifestations, including heart failure, arrhythmias, heart blocks, sudden death, thromboembolism, and stroke. Recently, simple clinical prognostic scores have been developed to identify high-risk patients and help with management. The treatment of Chagas cardiomyopathy focuses mostly on managing heart failure, arrhythmias, and thromboembolism. The role of specific antiparasitic therapy in the chronic form is not yet defined, and a randomized trial is now under way to address this crucial point. In this article, we review the main clinical aspects of Chagas cardiomyopathy and underscore some upcoming challenges for the appropriate control, diagnosis, and management of this complex disease."

As a neglected tropical disease potentially controllable with a major impact on morbimortality and socioeconomic aspects, Chagas disease (CD) was approved at the WHO global plan to interrupt four transmission routes by 2030 (vector/ blood transfusion/organ transplant/congenital). Implementation of universal or target screening for CD are highly recommended in blood banks of non-endemic regions; in organ transplants donors in endemic/non-endemic areas as well as in women at risk from endemic areas (reproductive age women/ pregnant women- respective babies). Moreover, main challenges for surveillance are the application of molecular methods for identification of infected babies, donor transmitted infection and of live parasites in the food. In addition, the systematic recording of acute/non-acute cases and transmission sources is crucial to establish databases for control and surveillance purposes. Remarkably, antiparasitic treatment of infected reproductive age women and infected babies is essential for the elimination of congenital CD by 2030."

Vector-borne and mother-to-child transmission cause several thousand new infections per year, and at least 5 million people carry Trypanosoma cruzi. Access to diagnosis and medical care, however, is far from universal. Starting in the 1990s, CD-endemic countries and the Pan American Health Organization-World Health Organization (PAHO-WHO) launched a series of multinational initiatives for CD control-surveillance. An overview of the initiatives’ aims, achievements, and challenges reveals some key common themes that we discuss here in the context of the WHO 2030 goals for CD. Transmission of T. cruzi via blood transfusion and organ transplantation is effectively under control. T. cruzi, however, is a zoonotic pathogen with 100+ vector species widely spread across the Americas; interrupting vector-borne transmission seems therefore unfeasible. Stronger surveillance systems are, and will continue to be, needed to monitor and control CD. Prevention of vertical transmission demands boosting current efforts to screen pregnant and childbearing-aged women. Finally, integral patient care is a critical unmet need in most countries. The decades-long experience of the initiatives, in sum, hints at the practical impossibility of interrupting vector-borne T. cruzi transmission in the Americas.

Success in these programs has been extensively reported in the literature, yet the strategies used for their implementation, as a model for such actions in different communities, have not been described. OBJECTIVES: To describe the aspects of prenatal care strategies in 13 municipalities within the regional healthcare unit of Araçatuba, in the northwestern region of the state of São Paulo in 2017, focusing on congenital toxoplasmosis. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive study on prenatal healthcare within the Brazilian National Health Sys-tem, in 13 participating municipalities. METHODS: Data on serological tests, referral clinics, notifications, healthcare strategies, health education and drugs for infected children were requested through a questionnaire that was sent via e-mail to people responsible for healthcare services in these municipalities. RESULTS: Major differences relating to diagnoses, reference outpatient clinics, notifications, health education and healthcare and drugs for infected children were reported among the prenatal strategies of these 13 municipal healthcare services. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of standardized prenatal strategy in the study area may compromise the prevention of infection. However, our identification of each aspect of prenatal care corroborates the need to implement a healthcare surveillance program relating to congenital toxoplasmosis. © 2020 by Associação Paulista de Medicina."

The control of the disease is restricted to toxic and potentially teratogenic drugs, which limit the use during pregnancy. The use of food supplementation offers a safe and low-cost form to alleviate Chagas disease symptoms, mostly in areas with alimentary risk. For example, zinc demonstrates positive effects in immune response, including in Chagas disease during pregnancy. Purpose: This study describes the innate response in pregnant rats chronically infected with T. cruzi and supplemented with zinc. Methods: Pregnant female Wistar rats, infected with T. cruzi, were treated with 20 mg/kg/day zinc sulfate and euthanized on the 18th day. Samples (plasma, splenocytes, and peritoneal exudate) were collected and several immune parameters (nitric oxide, RT1B, CD80/CD86, MCP-1, CD11b/c, NK/NKT, IL-2, IL-10, INF-cc, and apoptosis) evaluated. Results: Under Zinc supplementation and/or T. cruzi infection, the gestation developed normally. Several innate immune parameters such as RT1B, CD80/CD86, MCP-1 expressing lymphocytes, IL-2, and IL-17 were positively altered, whereas nitric oxide, CD11b/c, NK/NKT, apoptosis, INF-γ, and corticosterone demonstrated a pro-pregnancy pattern. Conclusion: Our results indicated that zinc has diverse effects on immune response during pregnancy. An anti-T. cruzi immunity, as well as a pro-gestation response, were observed after zinc supplementation. The complete comprehension of zinc supplementation in pregnancy will base an adequate strategy to alleviate Chagas disease symptoms and propagation, especially for populations from endemic areas. © 2020, Witold Stefański Institute of Parasitology, Polish Academy of Sciences."

Plasmodium vivax causes 76% of the regional malaria burden and appears to be less affected than P. falciparum by current elimination efforts. This is in part due to the parasi-te’s ability to stay dormant in the liver and originate relapses within months after a single mos-quito inoculation. Primaquine (PQ) is routinely combined with chloroquine (CQ) or other schizontocidal drugs to supress P. vivax relapses and reduce the risk of late blood-stage recrudescences of parasites with low-grade CQ resistance. However, PQ is contraindicated for pregnant women, who remain at increased risk of repeated infections following CQ-only treatment. Here we apply a mathematical model to time-to-recurrence data from Juruá Val-ley, Brazil0 s main malaria transmission hotspot, to quantify the extra burden of parasite recurrences attributable to PQ ineligibility in pregnant women. The model accounts for competing risks, since relapses and late recrudescences (that may be at least partially prevented by PQ) and new infections (that are not affected by PQ use) all contribute to recurrences. We compare recurrence rates observed after primary P. vivax infections in 158 pregnant women treated with CQ only and 316 P. vivax infections in non-pregnant control women, matched for age, date of infection, and place of residence, who were administered a standard CQ-PQ combination. We estimate that, once infected with P. vivax, 23% of the pregnant women have one or more vivax malaria recurrences over the next 12 weeks; 86% of these early P. vivax recurrences are attributable to relapses or late recrudescences, rather than new infections that could be prevented by reducing malaria exposure during pregnancy. Model simulations indicate that weekly CQ chemoprophylaxis extending over 4 to 12 weeks, starting after the first vivax malaria episode diagnosed in pregnancy, might reduce the risk of P. vivax recurrences over the next 12 months by 20% to 65%. We conclude that post-treatment CQ prophylaxis could be further explored as a measure to prevent vivax malaria recurrences in pregnancy and avert their adverse effects on maternal and neonatal health. © 2020 Corder et al."

HTLV-1 can be transmitted via sexual intercourse, contact with blood and from mother to child, mainly by breastfeeding. Treatments for the high morbidity/mortality associated diseases (ATL and HAM/TSP) are limited, therefore, infection prevention is of utmost importance. However, antenatal screening is not routinely performed in Brazil. A lack of data regarding the number of individuals infected via breastfeeding impairs the development of government policies. The objective is to estimate the number of HTLV-1 infections occurring annually due to mother to child transmission (MTCT) in Brazil, nationally and regionally. Methodology: To estimate HTLV-1 MTCT in Brazil the following variables are modelled: number of births, prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in pregnant women, breastfeeding duration rate and transmission risk according to breastfeeding period. The number of cases of HAM/TSP and ATL attributable to MTCT are also estimated. Principal findings: In 2008, there were 2,934,828 live births in Brazil. HTLV prevalence in pregnant women in Brazil ranges between 0.1–1.05% by region. An estimated 16,548 HTLV-1 infected women are pregnant each year. According to the breastfeeding pattern and HTLV-1 prevalence of each region there are an estimated 3,024 new cases of HTLV-1 infection due to MTCT annually of which 2,610 are preventable through infant feeding advice. These 3,024 transmissions will result in 120–604 cases of ATL and 8–272 of HAM/TSP. North-East region comprises the high number of MTCT cases, followed by South-East. Conclusions/significance: A high number of new HTLV-1 infections due to MTCT occur every year in Brazil. Antenatal screening and avoiding breastfeeding are essential to prevent subsequent development of HTLV-1-associated diseases. © 2018 Rosadas et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/."

Selenium is a key element in selenoproteins involved in the in the maintenance of the antioxidant defense. Diet with selenium is beneficial for the treatment of diseases correlated with high levels of oxidative stress, also observed in the Chagas disease. Chagas disease is a neglected disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and several research groups are focused on the illness treatment. Immunomodulation of the infection using microelements is an important tool to avoid deleterious effects of the Chagas disease. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the effects of selenium supplementation on pregnant Wistar rats infected with T. cruzi. Selenium treatment stimulated the weight and length of fetuses and placentas allied to the decrease of blood parasitemia. However, selenium demonstrated a low influence on T cells, diminishing the B cell population (CD45RA+). Moreover, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was downregulated under selenium administration. Low pro-inflammatory cytokines levels probably are related to the increase in the number of amastigote nests in infected and treated animals. Thus, selenium supplementation during pregnancy could impair the local placental immune response. Further studies are necessary to assess the interaction between selenium and the acute Chagas’ disease during pregnancy, which will base future supplementation strategies. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH"

Several articles have described the importance of micronutrients on pregnancy, which is sensitive to infections. In Trypanosoma cruzi endemic regions, the Chagas disease is aggravated by the lack of micronutrients in an average diet, to which pregnant women are more susceptible. The aim of this study was to evaluate distinct T cells phenotypes and intracellular cytokines by flow cytometry in pregnant Wistar rats under zinc therapy during experimental Chagas' disease. Twenty female Wistar rats were infected with 1 × 105 blood trypomastigotes (Y strain) and 30 days after infection the animals were mated and grouped: pregnant infected (PI–n = 5), pregnant infected/zinc supplied (PIZ–n = 5), pregnant control (PC–n = 5), control/zinc supplied (PCZ–n = 5). Zinc supplementation: 20 mg of zinc/Kg/day (gavage) for 18 days followed by euthanasia. The immune parameters showed: decreased percentages of CD62LlowCD44high surface marker for infected and treated group (PIZ) when compared to PI (p &lt; 0.05). Concerning to T regulatory cells (Treg cells), a significantly lower percentage of splenic Treg cells was found in the infected and treated group (PIZ) as compared to the PI group (p &lt; 0.05). The expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD28+ displayed a significant reduced percentage in TCD8+ for infected and zinc treated group (PIZ) as compared to (PI). The percentages of CD4+/CD11a+ T cells subsets were lower on PIZ as compared to PI. Concerning to CD45RA+ (B lymphocytes) analysis, infected pregnant and treated group (PIZ) showed a significant decrease in CD45RA percentage when compared to (PI) (p &lt; 0.05). The intracellular cytokine profiles for TCD4+ and TCD8+ producing IL-4 and IFN-γ revealed that zinc treated and untreated infected pregnant group (PI and PIZ) displayed increased cytokines concentrations as compared to zinc treated and untreated pregnant controls (PC and PCZ). Our data revealed the involvement of zinc as a signaling molecule in the modulation of the inflammatory process and immune response which occurs during pregnancy of T. cruzi infected rats. Zinc acted in a dual fashion, modulating the host's immune response in a way to protect the organism against the deleterious effects of the infection and an overwhelming pro-inflammatory response during pregnancy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

Demographic and Chagas disease status data were collected. Samples for Chagas disease serology were obtained on filter paper and the reactive results were confirmed with conventional samples. A total of 1,786 subjects were screened and 73 positive screening results were obtained: 17 were from children and 56 were from women. The Trypanosoma cruzi infection risk was greater in those individuals who had relatives with Chagas disease, who remember seeing kissing bugs, who were of Bolivian nationality or were born in the Argentine province of Santiago del Estero. The overall prevalence of Chagas disease was 4.08%. Due to migration, Chagas disease is currently predominantly urban. The observed prevalence requires health programme activities that are aimed at urban children and their mothers. Most children were infected congenitally, which reinforces the need for Chagas disease screening of all pregnant women and their babies in Argentina. The active search for new cases is important because the appropriate treatment in children has a high cure rate."

This presentation aims to focus on and update epidemiological data, research methods, involved factors, control strategy and possible prevention of congenital infection with T. cruzi. Considering that etiological treatment of the child is always effective if performed before one year of age, the diagnosis of infection in pregnant women and their newborns has to become the standard of care and integrated into the surveillance programs of syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus. In addition to the standard tests, polymerase chain reaction performed on blood of neonates of infected mothers one month after birth might improve the diagnosis of congenital infection. Recent data bring out that its transmission can be prevented through treatment of infected women before they become pregnant. The role of parasite genotypes and host genetic factors in parasite transmission and development of infection in foetuses/neonates has to be more investigated in order to better estimate the risk factors and impact on health of congenital infection with T. cruzi. © 2015, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

A major unanswered question is why reported transmission rates from T. cruzi-infected mothers vary so widely among study populations. Women with high parasite loads during pregnancy are more likely to transmit to their infants, but the factors that govern maternal parasite load are largely unknown. Better understanding of these factors could enable prioritization of screening programs to target women most at risk of transmission to their infants. Methodology/Principal Findings: We screened pregnant women presenting for delivery in a large urban hospital in Bolivia and followed infants of infected women for congenital Chagas disease. Of 596 women screened, 128 (21.5%) had confirmed T. cruzi infection; transmission occurred from 15 (11.7%) infected women to their infants. Parasite loads were significantly higher among women who transmitted compared to those who did not. Congenital transmission occurred from 31.3% (9/29), 15.4% (4/26) and 0% (0/62) of women with high, moderate and low parasite load, respectively (χx2 for trend 18.2; p<0.0001). Twin births were associated with higher transmission risk and higher maternal parasite loads. Infected women without reported vector exposure had significantly higher parasite loads than those who had lived in an infested house (median 26.4 vs 0 parasites/mL; p<0.001) with an inverse relationship between years of living in an infested house and parasite load. Conclusions/Significance: We hypothesize that sustained vector-borne parasite exposure and repeated superinfection by T. cruzi may act as an immune booster, allowing women to maintain effective control of the parasite despite the down-regulation of late pregnancy. © 2015 Rendell et al."

The aims of this study were to evaluate parasitemia, corticosterone levels, production of nitric oxide (NO), fetal morphological measurements, and histology of heart and placenta. Twenty pregnant Wistar rats (180-220 g) were grouped in: pregnant control (PC), pregnant control and L-arginine supplied (PCA), pregnant infected (PI), pregnant infected and L-arginine supplied (PIA). Females were infected with 1 x 10(5) trypomastigotes of the Y strain (3rd day of pregnancy). Animals were supplied with 21 mg of L-arginine/kg/day during 14 days. PIA showed significant decreased levels of corticosterone and parasitemia. For control groups, any alteration in NO production was found with L-arginine supplementation; for PIA, enhanced nitrite concentrations were observed as compared to PI. Weights and lengths of fetuses were higher in L-arginine treated and infected pregnant rats as compared to untreated ones. Placental weight from the PIA group was significantly increased when compared to PI. In l-arginine treated animals, cardiac tissue showed reduced amastigote burdens. PIA and PI displayed similar placental parasitism. Based on these results,L-arginine supplementation may be potentially useful for the protection against Trypanosoma cruzi during pregnancy.

Methods: We searched electronic databases, grey literature and reference lists of included publications to identify epidemiological studies on the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women and on the congenital transmission rate of T. cruzi infection in Brazil published between January 1980 and June 2013. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using fixed- and random-effects models. Results: Sixteen articles were included - 12 studies on the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women (549 359 pregnant women) and nine on congenital transmission rates (1687 children born to infected mothers). Prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women ranged from 0.1% to 8.5%, and congenital transmission rates from 0% to 5.2%. The pooled prevalence of Chagas disease among pregnant women across studies was 1.1% (95% CI: 0.6-2.0); the pooled congenital transmission rate was 1.7% (95% CI: 0.9-3.1). In 2010, 34 629 pregnant women were estimated to be infected with T. cruzi, and 312-1073 children born (mean: 589 cases) with congenital infection. Conclusion: Congenital Chagas disease is a neglected public health problem in Brazil. Systematic congenital Chagas disease control programs through routine prenatal screening for T. cruzi should be widely implemented in Brazil's endemic areas, to identify infected pregnant women and newborns at risk of congenital infection. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

The aim of the present study was to examine the potential role of zinc treatment during Trypanosoma cruzi infection in pregnant animals. Methods: Female Wistar rats weighing 180-200 g were used in all experiments. Production of nitric oxide, peritoneal macrophages counts, and concentrations of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were measured, and the potential protective effects of zinc on fetal development were assessed at 14-day post-infection. Results: Nitric oxide concentrations were higher in pregnant zinc-treated animals than in their untreated counterparts, despite similar levels of the macrophages, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Zinc therapy was associated with a significant reduction in parasitemia and cardiac parasite burden. Higher placental and birth weights were observed in animals given prenatal zinc supplementation compared to untreated animals. Conclusions: These data confirm the critical importance of adequate zinc intake during the peri-conceptional period and indicate that zinc has an effective role in preventing adverse outcomes of pregnancy and reducing the risk of common infections such as Chagas' disease.

This study evaluated HIV-1 subtypes amongst pregnant women living in the metropolitan area and in the interior cities from central western Brazil. From June 2008 to June 2010, 86.9% of confirmed cases of HIV-1 infection amongst pregnant women (172 out of 198 cases) were recruited in Goiania/Goias state. The HIV-1 pol gene was sequenced after nested-PCR. HIV-1 subtypes were assigned by REGA, phylogenetic, and bootscan analyses. The median age of participants was 26 years (15-41 years range); 58.7% of participants were diagnosed during prenatal care and 51.7% of participants came from >50 interior cities within Goias state. Amongst the 131 HIV-1 pol sequences, 64.9% were subtype B, 13.0% were BF1 recombinant, 11.4% were subtype C, 7.6% were subtype F1, and 2.3% were BC recombinant. According to the HIV-1 diagnosis date (1994-2010), a significant increase in subtype C and a decrease of BF1 mosaics were observed over time. All subtype C patients lived in interior cities where the highest prevalence of subtype C outside southern Brazil was observed (18.4%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple independent introductions of the Brazilian subtype C clade from the southern/southeastern regions of Brazil. The HIV-1 epidemic in women from central western Brazil infected by the heterosexual route is characterized by an unexpectedly high prevalence of subtype C viruses highly related to those circulating in southern/southeastern Brazil. These findings highlight the importance of molecular surveillance programs outside large metropolitan regions in Brazil. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

Infected infants were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. Recovery was assessed by parasite seeking at 1 month and 2 months as well as serological tests at 9 months. Assessment of treatment adherence was based on weekly home visits and use of electronic monitors. Results: Benznidazole was given to 63 newborns in group A (5 mg/kg in two daily doses for 60 days) and 61 newborns in group B (7.5 mg/kg in a single daily dose for 30 days). There was no difference in compliance between the two groups. The study confirmed the efficacy and good tolerance of both benznidazole regimens in the treatment of congenital Chagas disease. Conclusions: The short treatment should be preferred as it allows reducing the dose of benznidazole as well as the cost of treatment."

However, the effects of neem on lipid metabolism and oxidative stress during pregnancy remain to be investigated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Azadirachta indica (neem) on maternal reproductive performance and biochemical parameters in non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced mild diabetic rats (MD). Materials and methods: Pregnant rats were randomly distributed into six experimental groups: ND=non-treated non-diabetic (n=13); NDOil=non-diabetic treated with 1.2 mL/day neem seed oil (n=12); NDPA=non-diabetic treated with 1.0 mg/mL/day azadirachtin (n=12); D=non-treated diabetic (n=13); DOil: diabetic treated with neem seed oil (n=12), and DPA=diabetic treated with azadirachtin, n=13. Treatment with either neem oil (1.2 mL/day) or azadirachtin (1.0 mg/mL/day) was orally administered throughout pregnancy. Glucose test tolerance (GTT) was performed at day 17 of pregnancy and used as an inclusion criterion. At term pregnancy, maternal reproductive outcomes, lipid profile and oxidative stress status were assessed. Results: Treatment with neem oil and azadirachtin during pregnancy (1) had no hypoglycemic and anti-hyperglycemic effects on non-diabetic and diabetic rats, respectively; (2) affected OGTT glycemic levels in diabetic rats; (3) increased the proportion of fetuses classified as small for pregnancy age (SPA) in all groups; and (4) did not interfere with the lipid profile in non-diabetic dams. Neem oil reduced the rate of total cholesterol and NEFA in diabetic animals. Both neem oil and azadirachtin increased lipoperoxidation, characterized by increased MDA levels in non-diabetic rats. Conclusion: Both neem seed oil and azadirachtin impaired intrauterine development and altered antioxidant/oxidative status during pregnancy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

In the present study, we investigated the effects of zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) supplementation (20 mg/kg/day) during pregnancy in mice, Swiss Webster strain infected by the Y strain of Trypanosoma cruzi. Oral supplementation of zinc sulphate in pregnant and non-pregnant infected animals did not affect the count of blood parasites as well as tissue parasitism in the heart, liver, and spleen. Zinc supplementation did not alter female body weight, the length of fetuses and neonates, placental size/weight and mortality rate. Among zinc supplied animals, no significant plasmatic zinc concentrations were observed. Concerning to tissue zinc concentrations, only the liver displayed enhanced values as compared to other organs. For placental parasitism, zinc supplied group displayed a significant decrease in amastigote burdens (P < 0.05). However due to the reduced number of parasite burdens in placenta of animals supplied with zinc, these data suggest that zinc was partially effective in up-regulating the host's immune response against parasite, probably attenuating the infection in fetuses.

In this longitudinal cohort study we evaluated the congenital transmission of Chagas disease (CD) in a nonendemic area. The aim of this work was to analyze the predictive value of a Trypanosoma cruzi-positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result in pregnant women for the diagnosis of vertical transmission and to evaluate the use of PCR as a tool for early detection of infection. Methods. The offspring of 59 seropositive pregnant mothers were followed up. The parasitological status of mothers was studied by PCR in a total of 64 pregnancies; 10 of these women had received treatment before pregnancy. Sixty-five infants (including a pair of twins) were monitored at 0, 6, 9, and 12 months of age by PCR and serology. In cases of congenital transmission, hemoculture and parasite lineage typing were performed. Results. Nine infants had acquired CD congenitally. This represents a transmission rate of 13.8% among seropositive mothers (9 infected newborns of 65 total live births). All infants were infected with T. cruzi discrete typing unit V strain. A statistically significant correlation was found between T. cruzi vertical transmission and a positive PCR result during pregnancy (31%; 9 infected newborns in 29 live births). No infected infants were detected among 10 mothers who were treated before they became pregnant, compared with 16.4% (9 of 55 live births) among untreated mothers. Conclusions. PCR is a useful tool for the detection of congenital CD, and the treatment of infected women of childbearing age seems to be useful for preventing vertical transmission."

Method: ELISA and IFI IgG for ChD was performed for the pregnant women. PCR for T. cruzi was done for all chagasic mothers and their newborns. The congenital infection was confirmed by serial positive PCR and/or ELISA or IFI IgG after age of nine months. The placentas of mothers, with and without ChD, were submitted for histopathology and immunohistochemical study. Results: From 4831 deliveries in 2005 - 2009 with a serological coverage of 88.6%, it was established that 147 cases (3.4%) had ChD. More than 80% of the pregnancies had a physiological evolution and 90% of the newborn were term. Congenital transmission was demonstrated in six children (4.7%) of the 127 newborn studied by serial PCR (at birth and/or between 3 - 18 months) and/or ELISA or IIF IgG after age nine months. Most of congenital cases were asymptomatic (67%). The histopathology shows edema, necrosis, fibrinoid deposit in the placentas of 28 of 29 chagasic mothers. In three cases the immnunochemistry demonstrated a decrease in actin expression in trophoblast cells. In one congenital case amastigote nests was observed. Conclusions: These results indicate that T. cruzi infection in pregnant women and vertical transmission in Chile are still prevalent. For this reason it is important to propose control measures in endemic areas of the country."

Finally, 37% of the children were lost to follow-up in the exploratory phase and 53% during the operational phase (P = 0.002), significantly fewer than in most passive case detection studies. Conclusion Despite poorer outcomes after door-to-door screening activities have been transferred to the health system, a combined strategy based on active and passive case detection appeared to be efficient for identifying rural cases of congenital Chagas disease."

Sensitivity of kDNA-PCR increased from 75.6% to 95.6% when one to three sequential blood samples were analysed. Congenital infection (CI) was diagnosed in 3 neonates born to kDNA-PCR positive mothers, one who had transmitted CI in a previous gestation, pointing to family clustering of congenital transmission. Fourteen of 44 placental samples were kDNA-PCR positive, all from non-CI transmitting women, indicating that placental PCR is not useful for CI diagnosis. Placental PCR positivity was not related to maternal bloodstream PCR positivity and placental parasitic subpopulations not observed in bloodstream were detected by minicircle signatures. PCR targeted to intergenic regions of spliced-leader genes and serological tests using trypomastigote small surface recombinant antigens showed predominance of DTU group TcII/V/VI and only one patient infected with TcI. To our knowledge, this is the first PCR-based follow-up study of bloodstream and placental T. cruzi infections during pregnancy, including identification of DTUs. kDNA-PCR assays in serial blood samples provided high sensitivity for detection of T. cruzi DNA in pregnant women with chronic Chagas disease.

Preliminary results indicated that in this study period, 3.7% of the women who gave birth in the Province have Chagas disease and 2.5% of their newborns were infected. The most frequent T. cruzi genotypes found in mothers studied during pregnancy were TCI and TCIId, either alone or in mixed infections. A high percentage (74.3%) of the grandmothers studied was infected with the parasite. In 29 placentas from mothers with Chagas disease we observed edema, necrosis, fibrinoid deposits and slight lymphoplasmocyte infiltration. In three placentas we found erythroblastosis and in one of them amastigote forms of T. cruzi; this was one of the cases of congenital infection. The evaluation of the diagnostic and control protocols generated will allow us to determine if it has been possible to modify the natural history of vertical transmission of T. cruzi in Chile."

Congenital transmission is a major concern worldwide. In 2010, the Public Health Agency of Catalonia (ASPCAT) launched a screening protocol for Trypanosoma cruzi infection in pregnant women and their newborns. In 2012, ASPCAT detected appropriate follow-up of pregnant women but incomplete information about their offspring. Methods: The PROSICS community health team carried out active surveillance and community health action in target populations. These activities included active case searches, group awareness workshops and visualization campaigns as well as investigation of all lost children born from pregnant women with CD and their families. Results: Overall, 42/179 (23.5%) cases were included in the study: 35/42 (83.3%) children were born in Hospitalet de Llobregat (Catalonia, Spain); 4/42 (16.7%) were born in Latin America; two were miscarried and one was stillborn. The mean age of pregnant women was 31.3 years (SD 5.52; range: 21-44): 90.5% were Bolivian, of whom 74% were diagnosed with CD during pregnancy. Of the 35 newborns, 31 were recovered by community health action; 12/31 were correctly controlled at Hospitalet de Llobregat and 19/31 were controlled at a primary health centre. Of these 19 (73.7%)cases, 14 were not tested for CD by family paediatricians and were recovered by the PROSICS community health team. Finally, two (6.9%)of the 29 newborns tested with serology were positive. Conclusions: It is essential to implement active surveillance, education and information activities at paediatric primary care and community levels to avoid the loss of CD-infected mothers and their newborns. Training sessions addressed to paediatricians and other involved health professionals would consolidate surveillance and care reference circuits, improving the control of congenital CD."

To control transmission, it is essential to test all pregnant women living in endemic countries and all pregnant women having migrated from, or having lived in, endemic countries. All children born to seropositive mothers should be tested not only within the first month of life but also at similar to 6 months and similar to 12 months of age.

The seroprevalence against HIV, HBV, HCV, rubeola, T. gondii, T. pallidum and T. cruzi was determined in every pregnant immigrant, as well as in a representative group of Spanish pregnant women. Results: A total of 2526 immigrant and 157 Spanish pregnant women were studied. None of the Spanish and 0.5% of the foreigners showed antibodies against HIV; 18.9% of them were Sub-Saharan women. Antigen HBs was detected in 2% of the immigrant women and in 1.1% of the Spanish women. Asian women had the highest rate of type B Hepatitis (10.9%). There was 0.9% of type C Hepatitis among the immigrants and 1% among the Spanish. Within the cases with RPR >= 1/8, 1.6% were immigrants, most of whom were Latin American.

Young women of childbearing age and children infected with Tlypanosoma cruzi from endemic areas are at risk of developing the disease years later, and pregnant women can transmit the infection through the placenta. Methods: Serological screening for anti-T. cruzi antibodies was performed on all immigrant children coming from a Chagas endemic area and seen in our Pathology Unit between 2003 and 2008, as well as on newborns of T. cruzi positive infected pregnant women coming from Latin America. Two ELISA tests were used (bioelisa Chagas Biokit (R) with recombinant antigens, and an 'in house' ELISA with crude antigen). Patients with sufficient sample were also screened by nested PCR (TCZ3/Z4). Results: A total of 202 children, aged 1 day to 14 years old were included in the study, of whom 22 (10.8%) were diagnosed with asymptomatic infection, 5 of which were congenital as they were born in this country. All infected patients received treatment with benznidazole, with three of them currently with a serologically negative result after treatment. Conclusion: Chagas disease is a new imported paediatric disease that can affect children from endemic countries, but can also be acquired in our country by vertical transmission. Therefore, we believe that it is essential to perform serological screening on all children and pregnant women in the prenatal care from endemic areas, and provide specific treatment for those infected patients, given the good results observed in the paediatric population.

A total of 1,473 women met the inclusion criteria for the screening program with a resulting seroprevalence for T. cruzi of 3.5% (2.2-5.2% 95% confidence interval [95% CI]). One case of congenital infection was identified. Screening programs for vertically transmitted T. cruzi acute infection are beneficial in non-endemic areas for early detection and treatment of acute infection."

The aim of the study is to assess the knowledge of Chagas disease among doctors and nurses attending at-risk pregnant women in our province. Method: descriptive study through a performed anonymous and voluntary knowledge questionnaire for 278 physicians and nurses working at maternity and children's health services in the three hospitals in the province. In Poniente Hospital was established in 2007 a program of screening for the disease in pregnant women. For statistical analysis, quantitative variables were described using the mean and standard deviation. For comparison of qualitative variables we used the chi-square test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. Differences in age and years of experience depending on the hospital were measured by Brown-Forsythe robust test. Results: 116 (41.7%) professionals agreed to participate in the study. 80 (69%) were women and 36 (31%) men, mean age 36.78 years. By professional categories, physicians have a mean of 73.9% correct responses, the nurses 50.7%. Poniente Hospital had the highest percentage of correct answers on aspects of the geographical distribution of the disease (73.7%), the mechanisms of transmission (86%) and diagnosis (82.5%). Conclusions: The Poniente Hospital professionals generally have a better Knowledge about Chagas disease compared with two other professionals hospitals, which probably is related to the existence of the screening program for the disease."

Therefore, we investigated the rates of congenital infection of Trypanosoma cruzi by examining the seroprevalence among 1448 pregnant women in Oaxaca, Jalisco and Mexico City. We performed ELISAs to screen for recombinant and total antigens in mothers, and examined the frequency of congenital T. cruzi transmission by PCR with cord blood and antibody testing in children when they reached two years old. Our results showed that the prevalence of infection in pregnant women was 7.32% (106/1448) overall, and 4.4% (35/794) in Oaxaca, 12.02% (67/557) in Jalisco and 4.12% (4/97) in the Mexico City. In Oaxaca, T. cruzi infection was detected by PCR in 20% (7/35) of infants born to seroreactive mothers and 11.9% (8/67) in Jalisco. No infections were identified in infants from the Mexico City. From these only eleven serological follow up their children are agree to take blood. Therefore, the maternal-fetal overall transmission rate was 4.08% (4/98) in Oaxaca and 9.1% (3/33) in Jalisco 1.5% (1/65) children with positive serology were given specific treatment Chagas. In conclusion, these are the first reports of the rates of congenital Chagas disease in Mexico. The seroprevalence was higher in mothers from Jalisco, and could be related to that there is not the periodic fumigation of the transmitting vector performed in that state. The high rates of maternal-fetal transmission found in Oaxaca could be related to the differences of pathogenicity of trypanosome. No association between both the rate of congenital transmission and the gynecologic anthropometric data was observed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

With increased globalisation and immigration, it is a risk in any country, partly through congenital transmission. The frequency of congenital transmission is unclear. ObjectiveTo assess the frequency of congenital transmission of T.cruzi. Search strategyPubMed, Journals@Ovid Full Text, EMBASE, CINAHL, Fuente Academica and BIREME databases were searched using seven search terms related to Chagas disease or T.cruzi and congenital transmission. Selection criteriaThe inclusion criteria were the following: Dutch, English, French, Portuguese or Spanish language; case report, case series or observational study; original data on congenital T.cruzi infection in humans; congenital infection rate reported or it could be derived. This systematic review included 13 case reports/series and 51 observational studies. Data collection and analysisTwo investigators independently collected data on study characteristics, diagnosis and congenital infection rate. The principal summary measure - the congenital transmission rate - is defined as the number of congenitally infected infants divided by the number of infants born to infected mothers. A random effects model was used. Main resultsThe pooled congenital transmission rate was 4.7% (95% confidence interval: 3.9-5.6%). Countries where T.cruzi is endemic had a higher rate of congenital transmission compared with countries where it is not endemic (5.0% versus 2.7%). ConclusionsCongenital transmission of Chagas disease is a global problem. Overall risk of congenital infection in infants born to infected mothers is about 5%. The congenital mode of transmission requires targeted screening to prevent future cases of Chagas disease."

The mechanisms of congenital infection are uncertain. It has been suggested that the parasite reaches the fetus through the bloodstream by crossing the placental barrier, and that congenital Chagas' disease is the result of complex interactions between the immune response, placental factors, and the parasite's characteristics. We review the cellular and molecular mechanisms of infection and invasion of the parasite and how immune and placental factors may modulate this process.

Symptoms are usually mild with severe acute disease occurring in less than 1% of patients. Orally transmitted Trypanosoma cruzi outbreaks can have more severe acute morbidity and higher mortality than vector-borne infection. Congenital T. cruzi infection occurs in 1-10% of infants of infected mothers. Most congenital infections are asymptomatic or cause non-specific signs, requiring laboratory screening for detection. A small proportion of congenital infections cause severe morbidity with hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia, meningoencephalitis and/or respiratory insufficiency, with an associated high mortality. Infected infants are presumed to carry the same 20-30% lifetime risk of cardiac or gastrointestinal disease as other infected individuals. Most control programs in Latin America employ prenatal serological screening followed by microscopic examination of cord blood from infants of seropositive mothers. Recent data confirm that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is more sensitive and detects congenital infections earlier than conventional techniques. For infants not diagnosed at birth, conventional serology is recommended at at 6 to 9 months of age. In programs that have been evaluated, less than 20% of at risk infants completed all steps of the screening algorithm. A sensitive, specific and practical screening test for newborns is needed to enable Chagas disease to be added to newborn screening programs."

To date, there is no published information about clinical characteristics in children. Methods: We reviewed the medical files of all children (<18 years) with Chagas disease managed in 2 hospitals in Barcelona, Spain and Geneva, Switzerland between January 2004 and July 2012. Results: Forty-five cases were identified. Two children (4.4%) were diagnosed during the acute phase and the remaining 43 (95.6%) were in the chronic phase of the infection. All but 1 were asymptomatic. Of the 41 treated children, 40 (97.6%) completed 60 days of treatment. Thirty-five (85.4%) received benznidazole, 5 (12.2%) nifurtimox and 1 (2.4%) both drugs consecutively. There were 2 (4.9%) treatment interruptions due to adverse events. The most frequent adverse events were rash (24.4%), anorexia or insufficient weight gain (14.6%) and anemia (2.4%). Twenty-nine (64.4%) children were followed up by serology after 2 years. Five (17.2%) were cured. Conclusions: Pediatric Chagas disease is an emerging health issue in Europe that requires enhanced attention. Greater emphasis should be put on screening pregnant women at risk and their newborns in case of infection along with older children and relatives.

It highlights the epidemiological features of this transmission mode for the three main congenital parasitic infections due to Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi and Plasmodium sp. Information on the possible maternal-fetal routes of transmission, the placental responses to infection and timing of parasite transmission are synthesized and compared. The factors susceptible to be involved in parasite transmission and development of congenital parasitic diseases, such as the parasite genotypes, the maternal co-infections and parasitic load, the immunological features of pregnant women and the capacity of some fetuses/neonates to overcome their immunological immaturity to mount an immune response against the transmitted parasites are also discussed and compared. Analysis of clinical data indicates that parasitic congenital infections are often asymptomatic, whereas symptomatic newborns generally display non-specific symptoms. The long-term consequences of congenital infections are also mentioned, such as the imprinting of neonatal immune system and the possible trans-generational transmission. The detection of infection in pregnant women is mainly based on standard serological or parasitological investigations. Amniocentesis and cordocentesis can be used for the detection of some fetal infections. The neonatal infection can be assessed using parasitological, molecular or immunological methods; the place of PCR in such neonatal diagnosis is discussed. When such laboratory diagnosis is not possible at birth or in the first weeks of life, standard serological investigations can also be performed 8-10 months after birth, to avoid detection of maternal transmitted antibodies. The specific aspects of treatment of T. gondii, T. cruzi and Plasmodium congenital infections are mentioned. The possibilities of primary and secondary prophylaxes, as well as the available WHO corresponding recommendations are also presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Chagas disease was first described in 1909 by the Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, and due to the parasite's distribution throughout North, Central and South America, the disease is commonly known as American trypanosomiasis. However, this disease is now present in non-endemic countries such as Canada, the United States of America, and several countries in Europe (principally Spain). Moreover, Chagas disease was recently designated by the World Health Organization as one of the main neglected tropical diseases. The aim of this review is to summarize the research efforts recently described in studies conducted in Mexico on Chagas disease. In this country, there are no existing vector control programs. In addition, there is no consensus on the diagnostic methods for acute and chronic Chagas disease in maternity wards and blood banks, and trypanocidal therapy is not administered to chronic patients. The actual prevalence of the disease is unknown because no official reporting of cases is performed. Therefore, the number of people infected by different routes of transmission (vector, congenital, blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or oral) is unknown. We believe that by promoting education about Chagas disease in schools starting at the basic elementary level and including reinforcement at higher education levels will ensure that the Mexican population would be aware of this health problem and that the control measures adopted will have more acceptance and success. We hope that this review sensitizes the relevant authorities and that the appropriate measures to reduce the risk of infection by T. cruzi are undertaken to provide the Mexican people a better quality of life.

However, cases have been increasingly recorded also in non-endemic countries. The estimated number of infected people in Europe is in a wide range of 14000 to 181000 subjects, mostly resident in Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom. Methodology/Principal Findings: Retrospective, observational study describing the characteristics of patients with CD who attended the Centre for Tropical Diseases (Negrar, Verona, Italy) between 2005 and 2013. All the patients affected by CD underwent chest X-ray, ECG, echocardiography, barium X-ray of the oesophagus and colonic enema. They were classified in the indeterminate, cardiac, digestive or mixed category according to the results of the screening tests. Treatment with benznidazole (or nifurtimox in case of intolerance to the first line therapy) was offered to all patients, excluding the ones with advanced cardiomiopathy, pregnant and lactating women. Patients included were 332 (73.9% women). We classified 68.1% of patients as having Indeterminate Chagas, 11.1% Cardiac Chagas, 18.7% as Digestive Chagas and 2.1% as Mixed Form. Three hundred and twenty-one patients (96.7%) were treated with benznidazole, and most of them (83.2%) completed the treatment. At least one adverse effect was reported by 27.7% of patients, but they were mostly mild. Only a couple of patients received nifurtimox as second line treatment. Conclusions/Significance: Our case series represents the largest cohort of T. cruzi infected patients diagnosed and treated in Italy. An improvement of the access to diagnosis and cure is still needed, considering that about 9200 infected people are estimated to live in Italy. In general, there is an urgent need of common guidelines to better classify and manage patients with CD in non-endemic countries."

Conclusions: Oral transmission, through ingestion of contaminated food items has been the most frequent mode of transmission in Brazil in recent years. Other alternative mechanisms of transmission occur less frequently. It is important to understand these occurrences, especially now that vector transmission of the parasite is under control. Preventive measures have been presented, according to each of the situations considered, in line with current knowledge."

S. National Library of Medicine from 1940 to 2009. The search strategy was: Chagas disease [MeSH] OR Trypanosoma cruzi [MeSH]. Results: A total of 13,989 references were retrieved. The number of publications increased steadily over time from 1,361 (1940-1969) to 5,430 (20002009) (coefficient of determination for linear fit, R-2=0.910). Eight journals contained 25% of the Chagas disease literature. Of the publications, 64.2% came from endemic countries. Brazil was the predominant country (37%), followed by the United States (17.6%) and Argentina (14%). The ranking in production changed when the number of publications was normalized by estimated cases of Chagas disease (Panama and Uruguay), population (Argentina and Uruguay), and gross domestic product (Bolivia and Brazil). Conclusions: Several Latin American countries, where the prevalence of T. cruzi infection was not very high, were the main producers of the Chagas disease literature, after adjusting for economic and population indexes. The countries with more estimated cases of Chagas disease produced less research on Chagas disease than some developed countries."

Forty-two articles with relevant prevalence data were identified from a total of 4985 references. Prevalence ranged from 0% to 25.1%. Most surveys were performed in the Northeast region, especially in the state of Piaui. We observed a high degree of heterogeneity in most pooled estimates (I-2 > 75%; p < 0.001).

METHODS: First, the captured triatomines were identified using insect identification keys, then their intestinal content was examined by abdominal compression, and the samples containing trypanosomatid forms were inoculated in LIT medium and Swiss mice. RESULTS: Six triatomine species were collected in cities in Bahia, namely Panstrongylus geniculatus (01), Triatoma melanocephala (11), T. lenti (94), T. pseudomaculata (02), T. sherlocki (26) and T. sordida (460), and two in cities in Rio Grande do Sul, namely T. circummaculata (11) and T. rubrovaria (115).

Groups of 10 Swiss mice were inoculated with eight strains of TcIV obtained from acute cases (7) from two outbreaks of orally acquired ChD, and from the triatomine Rhodnius robustus (1) from Amazonas; and three strains of Tcll obtained from chronic patients in Parana. We evaluated the pre-patent period, patent period, maximum peak of parasitemia, day of maximum peak of parasitemia, area under the parasitemia curve, inflammatory process, and tissue parasitism in the acute phase. TcIV was less virulent than Tcll, and showed significantly (p < 0.005) lower parasitemia levels. Although the levels of tissue parasitism did not differ statistically, mice infected with TcIV displayed significantly (p <0.001) fewer inflammatory processes than mice infected with Tcll. This supported the working hypothesis, since TcIV from Amazonas was less pathogenic than Tcll from Parana; and agreed with the lower severity of human cases of ChD in the Amazon region.

Similar findings were observed in tissue samples from a human case of Chagasic cardiomyopathy. T cruzi infection of cultured cells displayed increased invasion with increasing cholesterol levels in the medium. Studies of infected host cells demonstrated alterations in their cholesterol regulation.

Oral infection is produced by the ingestion of infected triatomine bugs or their feces, undercooked meat from infested host animals and food contaminated with urine or anal secretion of infected marsupials.

Municipalities' vulnerability was assessed based on socioeconomic, demographic, entomological, and environmental indicators using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). Overall, 2275 municipalities were positive for at least one of the six triatomine species analyzed (Panstrongylus megistus, Triatoma infestans, Triatoma brasiliensis, Triatoma pseudomaculata, Triatoma rubrovaria, and Triatoma sordida). The municipalities that were most vulnerable to vector-borne CD were mainly in the northeast region and exhibited a higher occurrence of domiciliated triatomines, lower socioeconomic levels, and more extensive anthropized areas. Most of the 39 new vector-borne CD cases confirmed between 2001 and 2012 in non-Amazonian regions occurred within the more vulnerable municipalities. Thus, MCDA can help to identify the states and municipalities that are most vulnerable to the transmission of T. cruzi by domiciliated triatomines, which is critical for directing adequate surveillance, prevention, and control activities.

Belem, the capital of Para state, reports the highest number of acute Chagas disease (ACD) cases associated with the consumption of acai juice. Methodology/Principal Findings: The wild and domestic enzootic transmission cycles of Trypanosoma cruzi were evaluated in the two locations (Jurunas and Val-de Caes) that report the majority of the autochthonous cases of ACD in Belem city. Moreover, we evaluated the enzootic cycle on the three islands that provide most of the acai fruit that is consumed in these localities. We employed parasitological and serological tests throughout to evaluate infectivity competence and exposure to T. cruzi. In Val-de-Caes, no wild mammal presented positive parasitological tests, and 56% seroprevalence was observed, with low serological titers. Three of 14 triatomines were found to be infected (TcI). This unexpected epidemiological picture does not explain the high number of autochthonous ACD cases. In Jurunas, the cases of ACD could not be autochthonous because of the absence of any enzootic cycle of T. cruzi. In contrast, in the 3 island areas from which the acai fruit originates, 66.7% of wild mammals and two dogs displayed positive hemocultures, and 15.6% of triatomines were found to be infected by T. cruzi. Genotyping by mini-exon gene and PCR-RFLP (1f8/Akw21I) targeting revealed that the mammals and triatomines from the islands harbored TcI and Trypanosoma rangeli in single and mixed infections. Conclusion/Significance: These findings show that cases of Chagas disease in the urban area of Belem may be derived from infected triatomines coming together with the acai fruits from distant islands. We term this new epidemiological feature of Chagas disease as ""Distantiae transmission""."

Maternal antibodies may be indicators of risk or immunity. The aim here was to evaluate seropositivity for anti-Toxoplasma gondii (anti-T. gondii) immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and IgG avidity in pregnant women and their newborn infants. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study in a high-risk pregnancy outpatient clinic. METHODS: Serum samples from pregnant women (n = 87) and their respective newborns (n = 87) were evaluated for anti-T. gondii antibodies using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) (IgM and IgG), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (IgG) and an avidity test. RESULTS: Anti-T. gondii antibodies were identified in 64.4% of the serum samples from the mothers and their infants (56/87). Except for two maternal serum samples (2.3%), all others were negative for anti-T. gondii IgM antibodies, using IIF. The results showed that 92.9% of the pregnant women had high IgG avidity indexes (> 30%) and four samples had avidity indexes between 16 and 30%. Two women in the third trimester of pregnancy were positive for anti-T. gondii IgM antibodies; their babies had avidity indexes between 16 and 30%. The avidity indexes of serum from the other 83 newborns were similar to the results from their mothers. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that 2% of the pregnant women were at risk of T. gondii transmission during the gestational period. These data seem to reflect the real situation of gestational toxoplasmosis in the northwestern region of the state of Sao Paulo."

In 2008 to 2010, all subjects underwent medical history, physical examination, ECGs, and echocardiograms. ECG and echocardiogram results were classified by blinded core laboratories, and records with abnormal results were reviewed by a blinded panel of 3 cardiologists who adjudicated the outcome of Chagas cardiomyopathy. Associations with Chagas cardiomyopathy were tested with multivariate logistic regression. Mean follow-up time between index donation and outcome assessment was 10.5 years for the seropositives and 11.1 years for the seronegatives. Among 499 T cruzi seropositives, 120 (24%) had definite Chagas cardiomyopathy, and among 488 T cruzi seronegatives, 24 (5%) had cardiomyopathy, for an incidence difference of 1.85 per 100 person-years attributable to T cruzi infection. Of the 120 seropositives classified as having Chagas cardiomyopathy, only 31 (26%) presented with ejection fraction <50%, and only 11 (9%) were classified as New York Heart Association class II or higher.

Six discrete typing units (DTUs) of T. cruzi, named TcI to TcVI, are currently recognized. One unanswered question concerning the epidemiology of T. cruzi is the distribution pattern of TcII and hybrid DTUs in nature, including their virtual absence in the Brazilian Amazon, the current endemic area of Chagas disease in Brazil. Herein, we characterized biological samples that were collected in previous epizootiological studies carried out in the Amazon Basin in Brazil. We performed T. cruzi genotyping using four polymorphic genes to identify T. cruzi DTUs: mini-exon, 1f8, histone 3 and gp72. This analysis was conducted in the following biological samples: (i) two T. cruzi isolates obtained by culturing of stools from the triatomine species Rhodnius picttipes and (ii) five serum samples from dogs in which trypomastigotes were observed during fresh blood examination. We report for the first time the presence of TcII and hybrid DTUs (TcV/TcVI) in the Amazon region in mixed infections with TcI. Furthermore, sequencing of the constitutive gene, gp72, demonstrated diversity in TcII even within the same forest fragment. These data show that TcII is distributed in the five main Brazilian biomes and is likely more prevalent than currently described. It is very probable that there is no biological or ecological barrier to the transmission and establishment of any DTU in any biome in Brazil."

Because Chagas disease is primarily a zoonotic infection, we compared the enzootic Trypanosoma cruzi transmission cycles in three different environmental areas of Abaetetuba to better understand this new epidemiological situation. Philander opossum was the most abundant mammalian species collected (38% of the collected mammals) with a T. cruzi prevalence of 57%, as determined by hemocultures. Didelphis inarsupialis was abundant only in the area with the higher level of environmental disturbance (approximately 42%) and did not yield detectable parasitemia. Despite similarities observed in the composition of the small mammalian fauna and the prevalence of T. cruzi infection among the studied areas, the potential of these hosts to infect vectors differed significantly according to the degree of land use (with prevalences of 5%, 41%, and 64% in areas A3, A1 and A2, respectively). Domestic mammals were also found to be infected, and one canine T. cruzi isolate was obtained. Our data demonstrated that the transmission of T. cruzi in the Amazon basin is far more complex than had been previously taught and showed that the probability of humans and domestic mammals coming into contact with infected bugs can vary dramatically, even within the same municipality. The exposure of dogs to T. cruzi infection (indicated by positive serology) was the common feature among the studied localities, stressing the importance of selecting domestic mammals as sentinels in the identification of T. cruzi transmission hotspots.

Quantitative genetic techniques have been used to estimate the heritabilities for seropositivity for T. cruzi infection and traits that are associated with disease progression in chronic T. cruzi infection. These studies have demonstrated that a significant proportion of the variation in seropositivity and a number of traits related to Chagas disease progression is attributable to genetic factors. Candidate gene studies have provided intriguing evidence for the roles of numerous individual genes in determining cardiac outcomes in chronically infected individuals. Recent results from a long-term study of Chagas disease in a rural area of Brazil have documented that over 60% of the variation in seropositivity status is attributable to genetic factors in that population. Additionally, there are significant genetic effects on a number of electrocardiographic measures and other Chagas disease-related traits.

Since the introduction of benznidazole and nifurtimox approximately 40 years ago, many natural and synthetic compounds have been assayed against Trypanosoma cruzi, yet only a few compounds have advanced to clinical trials. This reflects, at least in part, the lack of consensus regarding appropriate in vitro and in vivo screening protocols as well as the lack of biomarkers for treating parasitaemia. The development of more effective drugs requires (i) the identification and validation of parasite targets, (ii) compounds to be screened against the targets or the whole parasite and (iii) a panel of minimum standardised procedures to advance leading compounds to clinical trials.

The objective of this study was to describe patterns of serologic results among donors to the three Brazilian REDS-II blood centers and correlate with epidemiologic characteristics. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The centers screened donor samples with one Trypanosoma cruzi lysate enzyme immunoassay (EIA). EIA-reactive samples were tested with a second lysate EIA, a recombinant-antigen based EIA, and an immunfluorescence assay. Based on the serologic results, samples were classified as confirmed positive (CP), probable positive (PP), possible other parasitic infection (POPI), and false positive (FP). RESULTS: In 2007 to 2008, a total of 877 of 615,433 donations were discarded due to Chagas assay reactivity. The prevalences (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) among first-time donors for CP, PP, POPI, and FP patterns were 114 (99-129), 26 (19-34), 10 (5-14), and 96 (82-110) per 100,000 donations, respectively. CP and PP had similar patterns of prevalence when analyzed by age, sex, education, and location, suggesting that PP cases represent true T. cruzi infections; in contrast the demographics of donors with POPI were distinct and likely unrelated to Chagas disease. No CP cases were detected among 218,514 repeat donors followed for a total of 718,187 person-years. CONCLUSION: We have proposed a classification algorithm that may have practical importance for donor counseling and epidemiologic analyses of T. cruzi-seroreactive donors. The absence of incident T. cruzi infections is reassuring with respect to risk of window phase infections within Brazil and travel-related infections in nonendemic countries such as the United States. © 2010 American Association of Blood Banks."

Some of these collected triatomines were infected by Trypanosoma cruzi in several developmental stages. Furthermore, the lactoacetic orcein method was used for cytogenetic analysis. Several abnormalities were observed during meiosis of the T. sordida mutants, including condensed chromosomes with no chiasma, chromatin bridges between the autosomes, and some non-pairing homologous chromosomes. Thus, our study suggests that Chagas disease is currently not under control in Brazil. Furthermore, we suggest that cryptic speciation may be occurring in populations of T. sordida of Brazil.

METHODS: We analyzed the occurrence of infections in 126 patients aged older than 18 years who underwent transplantation from 1986 through 2007 at a Brazilian University Hospital and who survived at least 48 hours. RESULTS: Heart failure diagnoses before transplantation were idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (38.6%), Chagas' disease (34.9%), coronary artery disease (19.8%), and others (6.3%). The respiratory tract was the most common site of infections (40.9%), followed by surgical wound site (18.1%). Trypanosoma cruzi reactivations occurred in, 38.8% of Chagas' disease patients: 47.0% had myocarditis, 23.5% had skin lesions, and 29.4% had both. New-onset ventricular dysfunction was observed in 47.0%, with complete response after specific treatment, and 41.0% were asymptomatic cases, diagnosed by routine endomyocardial biopsies. No patient died from such events. No differences in survival were found after 5 years of follow-up between recipients with and without Chagas' disease (p = 0.231). CONCLUSIONS: In a heart transplant population from a developing country, infectious complications occurred at a high rate. Tropical illnesses were uncommon, except for the high rate of Chagas' disease reactivations. Despite that, the overall outcome of these patients was similar to that of recipients with other cardiomyopathies.

Methods: Sixteen municipalities were randomly selected, 15 from the west mesoregion and one from the central, with an estimated population of 83,852 individuals. A total of 1,950 blood samples were collected in the west mesoregion and 390 in Caico. Anti-T. cruzi antibodies were detected using the Chagatest (R) ELISA HAI-hemagglutination kits and indirect immunofluorescence. As sera presented indeterminate results, TESAcruzi (R) western blot was performed to confirm reactivity. Results: An estimated seroprevalence of 6.5% was determined for the west mesoregion and 3.3% for Caico. Seropositivity rises progressively with the age of individuals, up to 40 years in Caico and up to 50 years in the west mesoregion. Only educational level and knowledge regarding the triatomine were associated with seropositivity. No seroreactive individuals under 18 years of age were identified. Conclusions: Infection by T. cruzi remains high and is concentrated in municipalities in the central western area of the west mesoregion; however, evidence suggests a decline in vector transmission in this mesoregion and in Caico. Epidemiological variables appear not to influence seropositivity, with the exception of education and knowledge concerning the triatomine, among seroreactive individuals from the west mesoregion."

It has been found that there is no specific clinical profile in newborns infected by T. cruzi, since during intrauterine development diverse pathological changes take place, causing alterations in the serological and parasitological profiles. Some intrinsic factors of the host, such as: the placental barrier and the ability of both, mother and fetus, to develop a specific immune response to control parasite multiplication, could be involved in such differences. Another possibility includes the genetic polymorphism of T. cruzi, since it is considered that strains of greater virulence can cross the placenta more easily and are more pathogenic to the fetus and/or the neonate."

We found that T. cruzi (Brazil strain) infection of mice results in pancreatic inflammation and parasitism within pancreatic beta-cells with apparent sparing of a cells and leads to the disruption of pancreatic islet architecture, beta-cell dysfunction, and surprisingly, hypoglycemia. Blood glucose and insulin levels were reduced in infected mice during acute infection and insulin levels remained low into the chronic phase. In response to the hypoglycemia, glucagon levels 30 days postinfection were elevated, indicating normal a-cell function. Administration of L-arginine and a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist (CL316, 243, respectively) resulted in a diminished insulin response during the acute and chronic phases. Insulin granules were docked, but the lack of insulin secretion suggested an inability of granules to fuse at the plasma membrane of pancreatic beta-cells. In the liver, there was a concomitant reduced expression of glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA and glucose production from pyruvate (pyruvate tolerance test), demonstrating defective hepatic gluconeogenesis as a cause for the T. cruzi-induced hypoglycemia, despite reduced insulin, but elevated glucagon levels. The data establishes a complex, multi-tissue relationship between T. cruzi infection, Chagas disease, and host glucose homeostasis.

In spite that in the past few years T. cruzi congenital transmission has become of epidemiological importance, studies about this mechanism of infection are scarce. The placental tissue undergoes apoptosis throughout gestation, as part of its normal turnover. On the other hand, it is known that T cruzi induces, delays or inhibits apoptosis in other mammalian tissues. In order to determine the effect of parasite invasion on normal apoptosis in the placenta, explants of human chorionic villi were incubated with 105 trypomastigotes for 24 h. Effective infection was tested by visualizing T cruzi antigens in histological preparations and by PCR. Upon infection, apoptotic cell death was determined by light and transmission electron microscopy, TUNEL analysis, measurement of caspase-3 like activity and immunohistochemical detection of caspase 3 cleaved cytokeratin 18. Our results clearly show that T cruzi induces apoptosis in the chorionic villi and suggest that this is one of mechanisms used by the parasite to insure infection and invasion of human placenta and fetus.

For this, 28 T. cruzi isolates were characterized by PCR, and the products of these reactions cloned and sequenced to reveal the existence of different TcI SL-IR genotypes. We also describe a new PCR assay able to discriminate between TcIb and TcId parasite populations. In summary, we have identified mostly parasites with the TcId haplotype and multiclonal populations with predominance of haplotype TcId (65.2%). Additionally, populations of haplotypes TcIb, TcIa and mixtures (TcId + TcIb, TcId + TcIa, TcIb + TcIa) are recurrent in samples obtained from children. The analysis of the SL-IR motif showed two clones depicting a different motif that could be an evidence for a possible hybrid haplotype between TcIa and TcIb (haplotype TcIa/Ib). Interestingly, in a single patient haplotype differences between T.cruzi isolates obtained pre and post-treatment were found.

We analyzed mortality trends due to Chagas disease in Brazil and regions, between 1979 and 2009. Methodology: Mortality data (underlying cause of death) were obtained from the nationwide Mortality Information System (SIM) of the Ministry of Health. We calculated crude mortality rates and rates standardized by age, as well as proportional mortality. Results: In total, 27,560,043 deaths occurred in the study period. In 172,066 deaths, Chagas disease was mentioned as the underlying cause (proportional mortality: 0.62%). The mean crude and age-standardized mortality rates were 3.61 and 5.19 deaths/100,000 inhabitants/year, respectively. During the observation period, Chagas mortality declined significantly at the national level (R-2=97%, p<0.001), with different patterns between regions. There was a significant reduction in mortality in the Central-West (R-2=90%, p<0.001), Southeast (R-2=98%, p<0.001) and South (R-2=94%, p<0.001), but in the North (R-2=34%, p=0.001) and Northeast (R-2=65%, p<0.001) regions mortality increased.

The North and Northeast regions, where vectors other than T. infestans have a primary role, need special attention."

The prevalence rate of Chagas disease was 1.2% and the majority of individuals confirmed with the disease over 50 years of age. A total of 761 specimens of triatomines were captured, most of which were from colonies composed of nymphs and adult bugs, and the majority of specimens were obtained in the dry season. Triatoma brasiliensis was the predominant species. Analysis using light microscopy revealed that 28.6% of the insects were Trypanosoma cruzi positive.

The state of Rondonia has an immense source of vectors (Triatomine) and reservoirs of Trypanosoma cruzi. Environmental changes brought forth by the deforestation in the region may cause vector behavior changes and bring these vectors to a closer contact with humans, increasing the probability of vector infection. Methods: This study was carried out to check the occurrence of Chagas disease in the municipality of Monte Negro, Rondonia, Brazil, based on a random sampling of the farms and people wherein blood collection from the population and capturing triatomines were done. The blood samples were submitted to serologic tests to detect antibodies of the IgG class against T. cruzi. The triatomines that were collected had their digestive tract checked for the presence of trypanosomatidae with morphology resembling that of the T. cruzi. Results: The population examined was mostly from other states. From the 322 bugs examined on the microscope, 50% showed parasites with morphology compatible with T. cruzi. From the serology of 344 random samples of human blood, 1.2% was found positive, 6% showed inconclusive results, and 92.8% were negative. Conclusions: Monte Negro shows low prevalence of human infection by T. cruzi and none active vector transmission; however, preventive and surveying measures, which are not performed until now, shall be taken due to the abundance of vectors infected by trypanosomatidae."

Methods: Seven stocks of T. cruzi were recently isolated in the State of Amazonas, Brazil, from humans, wild mammals, and triatomines. They belonged to the TcI and Z3 genotypes and were biologically characterized in Swiss mice. Parasitological and histopathological parameters were determined. Results: Four stocks did not promote patent parasitemia in mice. Three stocks produced low parasitemia, long pre-patent periods, and a patent period of 1 day or oscillating parasitemia. Maximum parasitemia ranged from 1,400 to 2,800 trypomastigotes/0.1mL blood. Mice inoculated with the T. cruzi stocks studied showed low positivity during fresh blood examinations, ranging from 0% to 28.6%. In hemoculture, positivity ranged from 0% to 100%. Heart tissue parasitism was observed in mice inoculated with stocks AM49 and AM61. Stock AM49 triggered a moderate inflammatory process in heart tissue. A mild inflammatory process was observed in heart tissue for stocks AM28, AM38, AM61, and AM69. An inflammatory process was frequently observed in skeletal muscle. Examinations of brain tissue revealed inflammatory foci and gliosis in mice inoculated with stock AM49.

Here, we provide evidence that epimastigotes, trypomastigotes, and amastigotes of T. cruzi (Brazil and Tulahuen strains) express a biologically active prostanoid receptor (PR) that is responsive to TXA(2) mimetics, e.g. IBOP. This putative receptor, TcPR, is mainly localized in the flagellar membrane of the parasites and shows a similar glycosylation pattern to that of bona fide thromboxane prostanoid (TP) receptors obtained from human platelets. Furthermore, TXA(2)-PR signal transduction activates T. cruzi-specific MAPK pathways. While mammalian TP is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR); T. cruzi genome sequencing has not demonstrated any confirmed GPCRs in these parasites. Based on this genome sequencing it is likely that TcPR is unique in these protists with no counterpart in mammals. TXA(2) is a potent vasoconstrictor which contributes to the pathogenesis of Chagasic cardiovascular disease. It may, however, also control parasite differentiation and proliferation in the infected host allowing the infection to progress to a chronic state."

We investigated the relationship between Chagas disease and long-term stroke mortality in a large community-based cohort of older adults. Methods: Participants were 1398 (80.3% from total) residents aged 60 years in Bambuí City, Brazil. The end point was death from stroke. Potential confounding variables included age, sex, conventional stroke risk factors, and high sensitive C-reactive protein. Results: Participants of this study were followed from 1997 to 2007 leading to 9740 person-years of observation. The baseline prevalence of T. cruzi infection was 37.5% and the overall mortality rate from stroke was 4.62 per 1000 person-years. The risk of death from stroke among T. cruzi-infected participants was twice that of those noninfected (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.25 to 4.44). A B-type natriuretic peptide level in the top quartile was a strong and independent predictor of stroke mortality among those infected (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.25 to 5.91). The presence of both a high B-type natriuretic peptide level and electrocardiographic atrial fibrillation increased the risk of stroke mortality by 11.49 (95% CI, 3.19 to 41.38) in these individuals. Conclusions: This study provides new evidence supporting a causal link between Chagas disease and stroke.

Results: There were 83 articles (2.8 articles/year) with a total of 291 cases. The co-infection was described in 1980 and this situation has become the defining AIDS clinical event in Brazil. This is the country with the highest number of publication (51.8%) followed by Argentina (27.7%).

The most severe form is the meningoencephalitis, with 100% of mortality without specific and early treatment of the T. cruzi. The medication of choice was the benznidazole on doses and duration normally used for the acute phase. The high parasitemia detected by direct or indirect quantitative methods indicated reactivation and its elevation is the most important predictive factor. The lower survival rate was related to the reactivation of the Chagas disease and the natural complications of both diseases. The role of the antiretroviral treatment on the co-infection cannot yet be defined by the knowledge currently existent.

We also evaluated the use of dogs as sentinels of epidemiological risk of Chagas disease. Dogs (n = 649) were examined by two parasitological and three distinct serological assays. kDNA amplification was performed in patent infections, although the infection was mainly sub-patent in dogs. The distribution of T. cruzi infection in dogs was not homogeneous, ranging from 11-89% in different localities. The interpolation method and map algebra were employed to test the associations between the lower richness in mammal species and the risk of exposure of dogs to T. cruzi infection. Geospatial analysis indicated that the reduction of the mammal fauna (richness and abundance) was associated with higher parasitemia in small wild mammals and higher exposure of dogs to infection. A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) demonstrated that species richness and positive hemocultures in wild mammals were associated with T. cruzi infection in dogs. Domestic canine infection rates differed significantly between areas with and without Chagas disease outbreaks (Chi-squared test). Geospatial analysis by interpolation and map algebra methods proved to be a powerful tool in the evaluation of areas of T. cruzi transmission. Dog infection was shown to not only be an efficient indicator of reduction of wild mammalian fauna richness but to also act as a signal for the presence of small wild mammals with high parasitemia. The lower richness of small mammal species is discussed as a risk factor for the re-emergence of Chagas disease."

Methods: Palm trees were cut down and dissected to search for triatomines. DNA from triatomines was extracted to investigate natural infection by Trypanosoma cruzi and T. rangeli. For statistical analyzes, data from infestation of palm trees, as well as the rates of natural infection by T. cruzi and T. rangeli were compared by Chi-square test. Triatomine density values were analyzed by the nonparametric Kruskal Wallis test and then comparisons between each pair of variables were made by the Mann-Whitney test assuming a confidence interval of 95%. Results: We dissected 136 palm trees, 60 at the end of the rainy period and 76 at the end of the dry period. Seventy-three of them (53.7%) were infested with triatomines and three species were found, namely: Rhodnius robustus, Rhodnius pictipes and Panstrongylus lignarius. We collected 743 triatomines, and R. robustus was predominant (n = 739). The identification of natural infection of the insects by trypanosomatids revealed that 125 triatomines were infected by T. cruzi, 69 by T. rangeli and 14 presented both parasites, indicating the presence of mixed infection in the same vector.

Brazil has made progress towards control, but different major challenges remain. This article discusses the potential role of operational research to address the challenges of integrating care and control of Chagas disease within the Brazilian Unified Health System. Methods: Based on the concept of operational research and on the scenarios of Chagas disease in Brazil, an analysis and review are performed of the role of this type of research as a strategy for strengthening health systems. Results: We identified aspects of program management, disease surveillance, control, diagnosis, treatment, prevention & rehabilitation, and education & communication. These actions must be integrated into initiatives promoting comprehensive care, where quality of care for people living with Chagas disease in all its clinical forms and surveillance are closely related, with the ideal opportunity for developing a primary health care network. Conclusions: Operational research maybe an effective tool for strengthening health surveillance within the Brazilian Unified Health System to improve quality and effectiveness of control of Chagas disease. The mobilization and integration of different stakeholders (program management, academic institutions, health workers, NGOs, social movement) extends its feasibility and sustainability."

In a search for alternative treatment for Chagas disease, essential oils extracted from traditional medicinal plants Lippia sidoides, Lippia origanoides, Chenopodium ambrosioides, Ocimum gratissimum,Justicia pectorales and Vitex agnus-castus were investigated in vitro for trypanocidal and cytotoxic activities. Essential Oils were extracted by hydrodistillation and submitted to chemical analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The concentration of essential oils necessary to inhibit 50% of the epimastigotes or amastigotes growth (IC50) and to kill 50% of trypomastigote forms (LC50) was estimated. The most prevalent chemical constituents of these essential oils were monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. All essential oils tested demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the parasite growth and survival. L. sidoides and L. origanoides essential oils were the most effective against trypomastigote and amastigote forms respectively. No significant cytotoxic effects were observed in mouse peritoneal macrophages incubated with essential oils which were more selective against the parasites than mammalian cells. Taken together, our results point towards the use of these essential oils as potential chemotherapeutic agent against T. cruzi. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Acai pulp has nutritional properties and is popular throughout Brazil and abroad. However, this pulp has been associated with microepidemics of acute Chagas disease (ACD) in northern Brazil, where agar fruit is the main food supplement. In this study, we examined the in vitro survival and in vivo virulence of Trypanosoma cruzi Y strain in acai pulp. Aliquots of in natura acai pulp produced in Belem city in the northern Brazilian state of Para were mixed with 10(5) trypomastigotes. The samples were incubated at room temperature or at 4 or 20 C for various periods, and the parasites were isolated by forced sieving. The resulting eluates were examined by microscopy, and the trypomastigotes were administered intraperitoneally, orally, or by gavage to immunodeficient mice (C.B-17-Prkdc(scid)/PasUnib) that had been pretreated with antibiotics. Parasitemia was quantified by the Brener method, and mortality was recorded daily. All routes of administration resulted in ACD. A 5-day delay in the onset of parasitemia occurred with oral administration. The survival and virulence of the parasites were unaffected by prior incubation at room temperature for 24 h, at 4 degrees C for 144 h, and at -20 degrees C for 26 h. These results indicate that T. cruzi can survive and retain its virulence in acai pulp under various conditions and that cooling and freezing are not suitable methods for preventing foodborne ACD."

Transfusion transmission is no longer a problem since generalized screening of blood donors came into routine. Congenital transmission, although still possible, mainly in some areas, also tends to disappear due to the control in the vector and transfusion transmission. The primordial mechanisms of transmission directly related to the enzootic cycle, as the one caused by vectors outside the homes, or by sporadic entrance of vectors in the domicile, in addition to the oral transmission, started to become relevant in the generation of new infections by Trypanosoma cruzi.

It is increasingly clear that parasite-derived prostaglandins potently modulate host response and disease progression. Here, we report that treatment of experimental T. cruzi infection (Brazil strain) beginning 5 days post infection (dpi) with aspirin (ASA) increased mortality (2-fold) and parasitemia (12-fold). However, there were no differences regarding histopathology or cardiac structure or function. Delayed treatment with ASA (20 mg/kg) beginning 60 dpi did not increase parasitemia or mortality but improved ejection fraction. ASA treatment diminished the profile of parasite-and host-derived circulating prostaglandins in infected mice. To distinguish the effects of ASA on the parasite and host bio-synthetic pathways we infected cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) null mice with the Brazil-strain of T. cruzi. Infected COX-1 null mice displayed a reduction in circulating levels of thromboxane (TX)A(2) and prostaglandin (PG)F-2 alpha. Parasitemia was increased in COX-1 null mice compared with parasitemia and mortality in ASA-treated infected mice indicating the effects of ASA on mortality potentially had little to do with inhibition of prostaglandin metabolism. Expression of SOCS-2 was enhanced, and TRAF6 and TNF alpha reduced, in the spleens of infected ASA-treated mice. Ablation of the initial innate response to infection may cause the increased mortality in ASA-treated mice as the host likely succumbs more quickly without the initiation of the ""cytokine storm'' during acute infection. We conclude that ASA, through both COX inhibition and other ""off-target'' effects, modulates the progression of acute and chronic Chagas disease. Thus, eicosanoids present during acute infection may act as immunomodulators aiding the transition to and maintenance of the chronic phase of the disease. A deeper understanding of the mechanism of ASA action may provide clues to the differences between host response in the acute and chronic T. cruzi infection."

This parasite reveals remarkable genetic variability, evinced in six Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) named from T. cruzi I to T. cruzi VI (TcI to TcVI). Recently newly identified genotypes have emerged such as TcBat in Brazil, Colombia and Panama associated to anthropogenic bats. The genotype with the broadest geographical distribution is TcI, which has recently been associated to severe cardiomyopathies in Argentina and Colombia. Therefore, new studies unraveling the genetic structure and natural history of this DTU must be pursued. Results: We conducted a spatial and temporal analysis on 50 biological clones of T. cruzi I (TcI) isolated from humans with different clinical phenotypes, triatomine bugs and mammal reservoirs across three endemic regions for Chagas disease in Colombia. These clones were submitted to a nuclear Multilocus Sequence Typing (nMLST) analysis in order to elucidate its genetic diversity and clustering. After analyzing 13 nuclear housekeeping genes and obtaining a 5821 bp length alignment, we detected two robust genotypes within TcI henceforth named TcIDOM (associated to human infections) and a second cluster associated to peridomestic and sylvatic populations. Additionaly, we detected putative events of recombination and an intriguing lack of linkage disequilibrium. Conclusions: These findings reinforce the emergence of an enigmatic domestic T. cruzi genotype (TcIDOM), and demonstrates the high frequency of recombination at nuclear level across natural populations of T. cruzi. Therefore, the need to pursue studies focused on the diferential virulence profiles of TcI strains. The biological and epidemiological implications of these findings are herein discussed."

We aim to investigate the relationship between BNP and anthropometric measures and whether it is influenced by T. cruzi infection. We measured BNP, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), triceps skin-fold thickness (TSF) and performed serological, biochemical and electrocardiographic exams in 1398 subjects (37.5% infected with T. cruzi) in a community-dwelling elderly population in Bambui city, Brazil. Linear multivariate regression analysis was performed to investigate determinants of BNP levels. BNP levels were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in T. cruzi-infected subjects than in the non-infected group (median = 121 and 64 pg/mL, respectively). BMI, WC and TSF in infected subjects were significantly lower than those in non-infected subjects (24.3 vs. 25.5 kg/m2; 89.2 vs. 92.4 cm: and 14.5 vs. 16.0 mm, respectively). There was an inverse relationship between BNP levels and BMI (b = -0.018), WC (b = -0.005) and TSF (b = -0.193) levels. Infected and non-infected groups showed similar inverse relationships between BNP and BMI (b = -0.021 and b = -0.015, respectively). In conclusion, there was an inverse relationship between BNP levels and the anthropometric measures. Despite the actions in the adipose tissue, T. cruzi infection did not modify the associations between BNP and BMI, suggesting that body mass does not modify the accuracy of BNP in Chagas disease.

Environmental and social factors have caused changes in the epidemiology of this disease - it was originally restricted to Latin America, but is now becoming a global heath concern in non-endemic areas as a consequence of human migrations. In Brazil, despite the fact that the most effective vector has been controlled, other triatomine species infest and colonize domiciliary habitats and can transmit the pathogen. As a consequence, Chagas disease transmission continues: the prevalence of the disease remains at ∼12 million people, with ∼200,000 new cases per year in 15 countries of Latin America, making control actions still necessary.

We conducted a multicenter, observational study on a cohort of mothers infected with T. cruzi, with and without trypanocidal treatment before pregnancy. Their children were studied to detect congenital infection. Among 354 ""chronically infected mother-biological child'' pairs, 132 were treated women and 222 were untreated women.

Ecologically, Brazil comprises several distinct biomes: Amazonia, Cerrado, Caatinga, Pantanal and the Atlantic Forest. Sylvatic T. cruzi transmission is known to occur throughout these biomes, with multiple hosts and vectors involved. Parasite species-level genetic diversity can be a useful marker for ecosystem health. Our aims were to: investigate sylvatic T. cruzi genetic diversity across different biomes, detect instances of genetic exchange, and explore the possible impact of ecological disturbance on parasite diversity at an intra-species level. Methods: We characterised 107 isolates of T. cruzi I (TcI; discrete typing unit, DTU I) from different major Brazilian biomes with twenty-seven nuclear microsatellite loci. A representative subset of biologically cloned isolates was further characterised using ten mitochondrial gene loci. We compared these data generated from Brazilian TcI isolates from around America. Results: Genetic diversity was remarkably high, including one divergent cluster that branched outside the known genetic diversity of TcI in the Americas. We detected evidence for mitochondrial introgression and genetic exchange between the eastern Amazon and Caatinga. Finally, we found strong signatures of admixture among isolates from the Atlantic Forest region by comparison to parasites from other study sites. Conclusions: Atlantic Forest sylvatic TcI populations are highly fragmented and admixed by comparison to others around Brazil. We speculate on: the possible causes of Atlantic Forest admixture; the role of T. cruzi as a sentinel for ecosystem health, and the impact disrupted sylvatic transmission cycles might have on accurate source attribution in oral outbreaks."

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was developed by the NHLBI REDS-II program in Brazil. Samples were collected from 499 T. cruzi seropositive blood donors who had donated between1996 and 2002, and 101 patients with clinically diagnosed Chagas cardiomyopathy. In 2008-2010, all subjects underwent a complete medical examination. After genotype calling, quality control filtering with exclusion of 20 cases, and imputation of 1,000 genomes variants; association analysis was performed for 7 cardiac and parasite related traits, adjusting for population stratification. Results: The cohort showed a wide range of African, European, and modest Native American admixture proportions, consistent with the recent history of Brazil. No SNPs were found to be highly (P&lt;10-8) associated with cardiomyopathy. The two mostly highly associated SNPs for cardiomyopathy (rs4149018 and rs12582717; P-values &lt;10-6) are located on Chromosome 12p12.2 in the SLCO1B1 gene, a solute carrier family member. We identified 44 additional genic SNPs associated with six traits at P-value &lt;10-6: Ejection Fraction, PR, QRS, QT intervals, antibody levels by EIA, and parasitemia by PCR. Conclusion: This GWAS identified suggestive SNPs that may impact the risk of progression to cardiomyopathy. Although this Chagas cohort is the largest examined by GWAS to date, (580 subjects), moderate sample size may explain in part the limited number of significant SNP variants. Enlarging the current sample through expanded cohorts and meta-analyses, and targeted studies of candidate genes, will be required to confirm and extend the results reported here. Future studies should also include exposed seronegative controls to investigate genetic associations with susceptibility or resitance to T. cruzi infection and non-Chagas cardiomathy. © 2013 Deng et al."

The transmission is primarily through vector-borne blood transfusion or during pregnancy, producing high mortality and morbidity among poor people in many countries of Latin America. In the last decades, the efforts have been focused mainly on the elimination of vectors. At the same time, screening of blood donors in order to avoid transfusional transmission has been improved all over the world. However, Chagas' disease is still a major public health problem, with estimates of nearly 90 million people at risk of infection and more than eight million infected in 18 endemic countries. Despite the high incidence in endemic regions and the dissemination of neglected diseases in North America and Europe, to date, there are only two drugs developedn and prescribed for the treatment of Chagas' disease, nifurtimox (tablets of 120 mg) and benznidazole (tablets of 100mg). In this review, different approaches carried out in the last decades for developing novel pharmaceutical formulations for the delivery of nifurtimox and benznidazole are discussed.

The recent development of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for Trypanosoma cruzi infection may improve patient access to diagnosis and care worldwide. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Chagas Stat-Pak RDT in a cohort of undocumented Latin-American migrants living in Geneva, Switzerland. Study participants were enrolled in a primary health care center. The Chagas Stat-Pak test was performed independently on blood and serum samples. A combination of two commercialized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based serological tests was used for comparison (reference standard). A total of 999 adults (median age, 36 years) were included in the study; the majority were women (83%) and originally from Bolivia (47%) or Brazil (25%). A total of 125 participants (12.5%) were diagnosed with T. cruzi infection; with the exception of three individuals, all individuals diagnosed with T. cruzi were originally from Bolivia. The sensitivity and specificity of the Chagas Stat-Pak test on blood samples were 95.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 89.2% to 97.9%) and 99.9% (95% CI, 99.3% to 100%), respectively. When the test was performed on serum samples, the sensitivity was 96% (95% CI, 91% to 98.3%), and the specificity was 99.8% (95% CI, 99.2% to 99.9%). The concordance of test results for blood and serum samples was 99.7%. Both negative and positive predictive values were above 98%. The Chagas Stat-Pak is an accurate diagnostic test for T. cruzi infection among Latin-American migrants living in Europe. The mild deficit in sensitivity should be interpreted in light of its ease of use and capacity to provide immediate results, which allow more people at risk to have access to diagnosis and care both in countries where Chagas' disease is endemic and in countries where this disease is not endemic.

For this study, the development of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in mice, induced by the oral and intraperitoneal (IP) routes, was compared. Four groups of Swiss mice were used to evaluate the influence of parasite genetics, number of parasites, inoculation volume and developmental stages on the development of the orally induced infection: 1 - blood trypomastigotes (BT) via oral; 2- BT via IP; 3 - culture metacyclic trypomastigotes (MT) via oral; and 4- culture MT via IP. Animals inoculated orally showed levels of parasitemia, as well as infectivity and mortality rates, lower than animals inoculated via IP, regardless of DTU (discrete typing unit) and inoculum. Animals infected with TcII showed higher levels of these parameters than did animals infected with TcI. The larger volume of inoculum showed a greater capacity to cause an infection when administered via the oral route. BT infection was more virulent than culture MT infection for both routes (oral and IP). However, mice inoculated orally with BT showed lower levels than via IP, while mice inoculated orally with culture MT showed similar levels of infection to those inoculated via IP. Mice inoculated with culture MT showed more histopathological changes than those inoculated with BT, regardless of the inoculation route. These results indicate that this alternative experimental model is useful for evaluating infection by T. cruzi isolates with subpatent parasitemia and low virulence, such as those belonging to the TcI and TcIV DTUs, which are prevalent in outbreaks of orally transmitted Chagas disease.

Methods: Of the 71 animals examined, seven were captured (two opossums, Didelphis albiventris; four rats, Rattus rattus; and one nine-banded armadillo, Dasypus novemcinctus) and 64 were domestic (one canine, Canis familiaris; five pigs, Sus scrofa; two bovines, Bos taurus; five caprines, Capra sp.; and 51 ovines, Ovis aries). Parasitological tests were performed to detect parasites in the blood and to identify the morphology of flagellates. These methods included fresh examinations, buffy coat tests and blood cultures. Molecular analysis of DNA for identification of trypanosomatids was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers S35 and S36. Results: The parasitological tests showed flagellates in an opossum and two cattle. The molecular tests showed DNA from T. cruzi in an opossum and a pig. Triatoma sordida was the only triatomine species found in the community, and it colonized households (four specimens) and the surrounding areas (124 specimens). Twenty-three specimens tested positive for flagellates, which were subsequently identified as T. cruzi by PCR. Conclusions: Data analysis demonstrated that T. cruzi has a peridomestic life cycle that involves both domestic and wild mammals."

During congenital transmission, the parasite breaks down the placental barrier formed by the trophoblast, basal laminae and villous stroma. The observation that only 5% of infected mothers transmit the parasite to the fetus implies that the placenta may impair parasite transmission. The trophoblast undergoes continuous epithelial turnover, which is considered part of innate immunity. Therefore, we propose that T. cruzi induces differentiation in the trophoblast as part of a local antiparasitic mechanism of the placenta. Methods: We analyzed beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and syncytin protein expression in HPCVE and BeWo cells using immunofluorescence and western blotting. Additionally, beta-hCG secretion into the culture medium was measured by ELISA. We assessed the differentiation of trophoblastic cells in BeWo cells using the two-color fusion assay and by determining desmoplakin re-distribution. Results: T. cnizi trypomastigotes induce beta-hCG secretion and protein expression as well as syncyntin protein expression in HPCVE and BeWo cells. Addionally, the parasite induces the trophoblast fusion of BeWo cells. Discussion: T cruzi induces differentiation of the trophoblast, which may contribute to increase the trophoblast turnover. The turnover could be a component of local antiparasitic mechanisms in the human placenta. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Other routes of infection include congenital, oral, organ transplantation, and blood product transmission. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From 2007 until 2011, New York Blood Center screened donations for the presence of T.cruzi antibodies using a Food and Drug Administrationapproved test. Confirmatory testing was performed and recipients of units donated by confirmed-positive donors were investigated via lookback. RESULTS: A total of 204 donors were T.cruzi antibody positive representing 0.019% of all donors during this time period (1,066,516 unique donors screened). Of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayreactive donors, 77 were confirmed positive by radioimmunoprecipitation assay (0.007%). At least 154 units from 29 of the confirmed-positive donors had been transfused to 141 recipients. At the time of lookback, 48 of the 141 recipients were alive and seven underwent T.cruzi screening. Two recipients were found to be immunofluorescence assay (IFA) positive. Both IFA-positive recipients received a leukoreduced apheresis platelet unit (two separate donations) from the same confirmed positive donor, a 72-year-old immigrant from Argentina. CONCLUSIONS: Lookback analysis was able to identify the first two cases of probable transfusion-transmitted T.cruzi infection since implementation of the national screening program, which increases the total number of reported cases in the United States to 8."

The objective of this study was to describe the Brazilian response to the challenges of Chagas disease: the history, current issues, and future of the Brazilian Network for attending and studying T. cruzi/HIV coinfection. Methodology: This descriptive study reviewed technical documents relating to the basis and structuring process of the Brazilian network for attending and studying T. cruzi/HIV coinfection. Results: The process of setting up the network was marked by technical and political debates in technical-scientific meetings going back to the 1990s. This process made it possible to expand and focus on different aspects of comprehensive care for Chagas disease in Brazil, regardless of the associated immunosuppressive conditions. These meetings produced a structure of national technical guidelines and standards, health care and research protocols and research priorities, along with mobilization and awareness-raising among HIV/AIDS reference centers regarding occurrences of coinfection. Conclusions: The creation of the Brazilian network was a milestone for the country in terms of integration of control programs, with the reference point of quality of care and comprehensiveness.

We propose that transmission of T. cruzi and T. evansi in the southern Pantanal region takes place via an intricate ecological trophic network involving generalist and specialist mammal species that are linked through a robust food-web connection.

Infection results in myocarditis, fat loss and alterations in lipid homeostasis. This study was aimed at analyzing the effect of high fat diet (HFD) on regulating acute T. cruzi infection-induced myocarditis and to evaluate the effect of HFD on lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and heart during acute T. cruzi infection. Methodology/Principal Findings: CD1 mice were infected with T. cruzi (Brazil strain) and fed either a regular control diet (RD) or HFD for 35 days following infection. Serum lipid profile, tissue cholesterol levels, blood parasitemia, and tissue parasite load were analyzed to evaluate the effect of diet on infection. MicroPET and MRI analysis were performed to examine the morphological and functional status of the heart during acute infection. qPCR and immunoblot analysis were carried out to analyze the effect of diet on the genes involved in the host lipid metabolism during infection. Oil red O staining of the adipose tissue demonstrated reduced lipolysis in HFD compared to RD fed mice. HFD reduced mortality, parasitemia and cardiac parasite load, but increased parasite load in adipocytes. HFD decreased lipolysis during acute infection. Both qPCR and protein analysis demonstrated alterations in lipid metabolic pathways in adipose tissue and heart in RD fed mice, which were further modulated by HFD. Both microPET and MRI analyses demonstrated changes in infected RD murine hearts which were ameliorated by HFD. Conclusion/Significance: These studies indicate that Chagasic cardiomyopathy is associated with a cardiac lipidpathy and that both cardiac lipotoxicity and adipose tissue play a role in the pathogenesis of Chagas disease. HFD protected mice from T. cruzi infection-induced myocardial damage most likely due to the effects of HFD on both adipogenesis and T. cruzi infection-induced cardiac lipidopathy."

Certain combinations of mouse and parasite strains produce significant histopathology and can be used for safety analyses of new vaccination strategies. The goals of this study were to determine (1) whether the development of chagasic cardiomyopathy in the murine model could be identified by electrocardiogram (ECG); and (2) whether these potential chagasic ECG changes would correlate with histopathologic findings. Groups of BALB/c, C57BL/6, and C3H mice were infected with different parasite strains (Tulahuen, Brazil, or Sylvio-X10/4) and evaluated weekly by ECG. Selected tissues from subsets of mice were harvested periodically for blinded histologic evaluation. Significantly increased proportions of BALB/c mice infected with Brazil and Tulahuen strain parasites displayed prolonged QT intervals. Prolonged mean QT intervals detected in infected BALB/c mice significantly correlated with chagasic histopathologic changes.

Historically, vector-borne transmission of T. cruzi has been the most important mechanism through which humans have become infected with the parasite, but transmission by blood transfusion and congenital transmission also have been important. In many of the endemic countries transmission of T. cruzi has improved markedly in recent years as vector control and donor screening programs have been implemented on a widespread basis. In the United States autochthonous transmission of T. cruzi appears to be extremely rare. Five persons are known to have become infected with T. cruzi through organ transplants here, and prior to the implementation of blood donor screening in 2007 five instances of transmission by transfusion had been reported.

Chagas disease is a parasitic disease due to Typanosoma cruzi, endemic in Central and Southern America, where the protozoon infects about 8-10 million people. In rural areas the infection is acquired mostly through reduviidae insect vectors, whereas in urban ones it is acquired mainly through the transfusion of blood products, vertical transmission and organ transplantation. The important migratory flows of the last decades have focused attention on possible T cruzi transmission by transfusion also in non-endemic countries, and platelets have been recognised as the main origin of infection for recipients from serologically-positive Latino-American donors. Materials and methods. In order to avoid the occurrence of transfusion-related cases, in 2010 systematic screening for anti-T cruzi antibodies was started at the Umberto I Polyclinic in Rome, controlling blood donors born and/or coming from Latin-American countries in which the disease is endemic. The aim of this paper is to report the preliminary results achieved since the introduction of this screening. Results. Anti-T cruzi antibodies have been detected to date in 3.9% out of the 128 people examined. A seropositive subject also proved positive by polymerase chain reaction analysis and showed very light parasitaemia. Discussion. The preliminary results are quite alarming. Indeed, serological findings exceed those reported in other non-endemic countries, and Italian travellers proved to be an insidious possible source of direct transmission. The need for systematic screening of at-risk blood donors also in non-endemic countries is emphasised."

The Benznidazole Evaluation for Interrupting Trypanosomiasis (BENEFIT) study is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of benznidazole (BZ) treatment in patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC). One important question to be addressed concerns the effectiveness of BZ in reducing overall parasite load in CCC patients, even in the absence of parasitological cure. This report describes the evaluation of multiple procedures for DNA extraction and qPCR-based protocols aiming to establish a standardized methodology for the absolute quantification of T. cruzi DNA in Guanidine-EDTA blood (GEB) samples. A panel of five primer sets directed to the T. cruzi nuclear satellite DNA repeats (Sat-DNA) and to the minicircle DNA conserved regions (kDNA) was compared in either SYBR Green or TaqMan systems. Standard curve parameters such as, amplification efficiency, coefficient of determination and intercept were evaluated, as well as different procedures to generate standard samples containing pre-established T. cruzi DNA concentration. Initially, each primer set was assayed in a SYBR Green qPCR to estimate parasite load in GEB samples from chronic Chagas disease patients. The results achieved from Bayesian transmutability analysis elected the primer sets Cruzi1/Cruzi2 (p = 0.0031) and Diaz7/Diaz8 (p = 0.0023) coupled to the QIAamp DNA Kit extraction protocol (silica gel column), as the most suitable for monitoring parasitemia in these patients. Comparison between the parasite burden of 150 GEB samples of BENEFIT patients from Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, prior to drug/placebo administration, was performed using Cruzi1/Cruzi2 primers in a SYBR Green approach. The median parasitemia found in patients from Argentina and Colombia (1.93 and 2.31 parasite equivalents/mL, respectively) was around 20 times higher than the one estimated for the Brazilian patients (0.1 parasite equivalents/mL). This difference could be in part due to the complexity of T. cruzi genetic diversity, which is a factor possibly implicated in different clinical presentations of the disease and/or influencing parasitemia levels in infected individuals from different regions of Latin America. The results of SYBR Green qPCR assays herein presented prove this methodology to be more cost efficient than the alternative use of internal fluorogenic probes. In addition, its sensitivity and reproducibility are shown to be adequate to detect low parasitemia burden in patients with chronic Chagas disease. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Methods: Quarterly visits were conducted between March 2009 and March 2010, and the homes to be visited for the active search of insects were determined by random selection. In each housing unit, the insects were collected by a manual search with a metal clip and flashlight to inspect openings and cavities, with a collection time of one hour/home/individual. The Pirisa (R) dislodge chemical was used to force the insects to leave their ecotopes. Analysis of the intestinal contents of triatomines was performed in the laboratory to establish the presence of Trypanosomatidae. Results: Of the 103 dwellings surveyed, 17.5% were infested with Panstrongylus megistus. The village of Mutuca exhibited the highest infestation rate (38.1%).

We aimed to analyze the spatial and temporal occurrence of triatomine species collected in DF, and their indices of natural infection with trypanosomes. Methods: The Health State Secretariat of DF recorded triatomines between 2002 and 2010 in 20 administrative regions. This retrospective analysis considered the number of adults and nymphs of each species collected and infected in both intradomicile and peridomicile. Results: A total of 754 triatomines were collected in 252 reported domiciles. Panstrongylus megistus was the most frequent species (65%), followed by T. pseudomaculata (14%). Of the 309 examined insects, only 3 (1%) specimens of P. megistus were infected with flagellates morphologically similar to Trypanosoma cruzi. The spatial occurrence indicated a higher diversity of triatomines and frequency of T. sordida in rural areas. Moreover, there was a predominance of P. megistus in urban areas. The number of records of P. megistus in the rainy season was two times higher than that during the dry season. The largest number of triatomines was collected in November. Conclusions: The presence of P. megistus specimens infected with trypanosomes in domiciles, shows the potential risk of human infection in DF. Thus, it is essential to continue entomological surveillance, intensifying it in the rainy season and in regions of greater occurrence."

Based on these findings, the main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate ester (DHEA-S) therapy alone or in combination with benznidazole (BNZ) (recommended in Brazil for the treatment of T. cruzi infection) will be effective during the acute phase of two different lineages of T. cruzi strains: type I (Y strain) and type II (Bolivia strain) of T. cruzi. Administration of either DHEA-S or BNZ alone or in combination significantly reduced the Y strain parasite load as compared with untreated. Furthermore treatment with DHEA-S resulted in Bolivia strain clearance. This protective effect of DHEA-S was associated with the host's immune response, as evidence by enhanced levels of interferon-gamma and interleukin-2. DHEA-S treatment also increased peritoneal macrophages levels and nitrite production. DHEA-S treatment was effective in reducing the mortality rate as compared to BNZ alone or to combiner DHEA-S+BNZ treatment of T. cruzi Bolivia strain infected animals. These findings suggest that hormonal therapy may have a protective effect in the treatment of T. cruzi infection. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved."

Twenty patients with the cardiac form of the disease (CARD), of whom 10 had the mild cardiac form (CARD 1) and 10 the severe cardiac form (CARD 2), and 20 patients with the indeterminate form (IND), were selected at the Chagas Disease Unit of the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital, University of Pernambuco, Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. The PBMCs of these individuals were cultured in the presence of CRA or FRA for 3 days and IL-10 and IFN-gamma gene expression was evaluated by detection of its messenger RNA using Real Time Quantitative PCR. Although no significant difference was observed between the groups of individuals studied, we found that most patients with IND displayed high levels of IFN-gamma gene expression, while the majority of patients with CARD 1 presented high levels of IL-10. The results of this study thus highlight the important role that inflammatory cytokines play in patients with the IND group controlling for parasite replication, and that anti-inflammatory cytokines play in determining susceptibility to progression to symptomatic clinical forms of the disease.

Drug therapy for acute and chronic disease is limited. Stem cell therapy with bone marrow mesenchymal cells (MSCs) has emerged as a novel therapeutic option for cell death-related heart diseases, but efficacy of MSC has not been tested in Chagas disease. Methods and Results: We now report the use of cell-tracking strategies with nanoparticle labeled MSC to investigate migration of transplanted MSC in a murine model of Chagas disease, and correlate MSC biodistribution with glucose metabolism and morphology of heart in chagasic mice by small animal positron emission tomography (microPET). Mice were infected intraperitoneally with trypomastigotes of the Brazil strain of T. cruzi and treated by tail vein injection with MSC one month after infection. MSCs were labeled with near infrared fluorescent nanoparticles and tracked by an in vivo imaging system (IVIS). Our IVIS results two days after transplant revealed that a small, but significant, number of cells migrated to chagasic hearts when compared with control animals, whereas the vast majority of labeled MSC migrated to liver, lungs and spleen. Additionally, the microPET technique demonstrated that therapy with MSC reduced right ventricular dilation, a phenotype of the chagasic mouse model. Conclusions: We conclude that the beneficial effects of MSC therapy in chagasic mice arise from an indirect action of the cells in the heart rather than a direct action due to incorporation of large numbers of transplanted MSC into working myocardium."

In the US, NTDs such as Chagas disease, cysticercosis, toxocariasis, and trichomoniasis are also common among poor populations.

Methods: The study sample of this cross-sectional study consists of 1014 subjects >= 60 years old (mean age = 68.3; SD = 6.9) residing in Bambui City (Southeast Brazil). ECG was recorded and one-breath sinus arrhythmia test was performed. Maximal expiratory over the minimal inspiratory (E: I) ratio and heart rate variability (HRV) measurements were calculated. Ordinal logistic regression was used to assess the relation between vagal indexes and chronic T. cruzi infection. Results: The prevalence of T. cruzi infection was 32.0% and of major ECG abnormalities, 43.4%. Among individuals aged 60-69 years, T. cruzi infection was significantly and independently associated with reduced SDNN(OR 0.38; 95%CI 0.27-0.53), RMSSD(OR 0.48; 0.34-0.67) and EI: ratio (OR 0.45; 95%CI 0.33-0.63). Among individuals aged > 70 years, no significant odds ratios were found in either the unadjusted or the adjusted analysis. The presence of major ECG abnormalities did not affect the association between vagal indexes and T. cruzi infection. Conclusions: Disease-specific vagal cardiac dysfunction was observed in ChD individuals below 70. However, further ageing interferes significantly with vagal heart modulation, attenuating the difference of HRV indexes between ChD and non-ChD subjects. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Chagas had several enemies at Oswaldo Cruz Institute mainly because of his election to Head of Service in 1910, and for the position of Oswaldo Cruz Directorship in 1917. Furthermore, Chagas gained enemies at Faculty of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro, which did not like to see the economical political autonomy of Oswaldo Cruz Institute. This allowed the Institute not only to perform top experimental research, but also to take the leadership of research in the country. Chagas was nominated to the Nobel Prize of 1921 in December, 1920. None was awarded the Nobel Prize in that year. He seems to have been evaluated by the Noble Committee of Karolinska Institute from March to May of 1921. At that time, his enemies were denying his discovery of Trypanosoma cruzi, a key point in Chagas' nomination by Karolinska Institute, and giving no epidemiological importance for the disease. By the same way, the obligation of small pox vaccination was tarnishing his public image. Having taken into account the epidemiologic importance of Chagas disease, the strong historical mistake in the process of Chagas evaluation, and the inequity behind all these facts, we insist on a posthumous Nobel Prize for the man who made the most complete medical-scientist discovery of all time.

Members of the complex are diverse in terms of epidemiological importance, morphology, biology, ecology, and genetics. Triatoma b. brasiliensis is the most disease-relevant member of the complex in terms of epidemiology, extensive distribution, broad feeding preferences, broad ecological distribution, and high rates of infection with Trypanosoma cruzi; consequently, it is considered the principal vector of Chagas disease in northeastern Brazil. Methods: We used ecological niche models to estimate potential distributions of all members of the complex, and evaluated the potential for suitable adjacent areas to be colonized; we also present first evaluations of potential for climate change-mediated distributional shifts. Models were developed using the GARP and Maxent algorithms. Results: Models for three members of the complex (T. b. brasiliensis, N = 332; T. b. macromelasoma, N = 35; and T. juazeirensis, N = 78) had significant distributional predictivity; however, models for T. sherlocki and T. melanica, both with very small sample sizes (N = 7), did not yield predictions that performed better than random. Model projections onto future-climate scenarios indicated little broad-scale potential for change in the potential distribution of the complex through 2050. Conclusions: This study suggests that T. b. brasiliensis is the member of the complex with the greatest distributional potential to colonize new areas: overall; however, the distribution of the complex appears relatively stable. These analyses offer key information to guide proactive monitoring and remediation activities to reduce risk of Chagas disease transmission."

In this pathology, oral transmission represents an emerging epidemiological scenario where different outbreaks associated to food/beverages consumption have been reported in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela. In Colombia, six human oral outbreaks have been reported corroborating the importance of this transmission route. Molecular epidemiology of oral outbreaks is barely known observing the incrimination of TcI, TcII, TcIV and TcV genotypes. Methodology and Principal Findings: High-throughput molecular characterization was conducted performing MLMT (Multilocus Microsatellite Typing) and mtMLST (mitochondrial Multilocus Sequence Typing) strategies on 50 clones from ten isolates. Results allowed observing the occurrence of TcI, TcIV and mixed infection of distinct TcI genotypes. Thus, a majority of specific mitochondrial haplotypes and allelic multilocus genotypes associated to the sylvatic cycle of transmission were detected in the dataset with the foreseen presence of mitochondrial haplotypes and allelic multilocus genotypes associated to the domestic cycle of transmission. Conclusions: These findings suggest the incrimination of sylvatic genotypes in the oral outbreaks occurred in Colombia. We observed patterns of super-infection and/or co-infection with a tailored association with the severe forms of myocarditis in the acute phase of the disease. The transmission dynamics of this infection route based on molecular epidemiology evidence was unraveled and the clinical and biological implications are discussed."

Herein, we simultaneously investigate the contribution of both host and parasite factors during acute phase of infection in BALB/c mice infected with the JG and/or CL Brener T. cruzi strains. JG single infected mice presented reduced parasitemia and heart parasitism, no mortality, levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, CCL2, IL-6 and IFN-gamma) similar to those found among naive animals and no clinical manifestations of disease. On the other hand, CL Brener single infected mice presented higher parasitemia and heart parasitism, as well as an increased systemic release of pro-inflammatory mediators and higher mortality probably due to a toxic shock-like systemic inflammatory response. Interestingly, coinfection with JG and CL Brener strains resulted in intermediate parasitemia, heart parasitism and mortality. This was accompanied by an increase in the systemic release of IL-10 with a parallel increase in the number of MAC-3(+) and CD4(+) T spleen cells expressing IL-10. Therefore, the endogenous production of IL-10 elicited by coinfection seems to be crucial to counterregulate the potentially lethal effects triggered by systemic release of pro-inflammatory mediators induced by CL Brener single infection. In conclusion, our results suggest that the composition of the infecting parasite population plays a role in the host response to T. cruzi in determining the severity of the disease in experimentally infected BALB/c mice. The combination of JG and CL Brener was able to trigger both protective inflammatory immunity and regulatory immune mechanisms that attenuate damage caused by inflammation and disease severity in BALB/c mice."

We evaluated 10 positive for Trypanosoma cruzi dogs, that were identified by serological analysis of immuno fluorescence assay (RIFI) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); molecular analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct microscopy and blood culture. The chagasic dogs underwent physical examination, electrocardiographic, radiographic, blood pressure, hematology (erythrocyte and leukocyte count) and biochemical exams (urea, creatinine, ALT, AST, PT, albumin, globulin, CK, CK-MB, and cTnl). The physical examination and the blood pressure were presented within the normal range, while in the electrocardiography the FC was observed as normal with a sinus rhythm, with the exception of one dog that presented a sinus tachycardia (168 bat/min). In the ECG of eight dogs there was increase of duration of P (47 +/- 6.5ms) suggestive to atrial enlargement, not confirmed in the radiography. A supraunlevelling was observed in the ST segment in one dog. In the hematological results, thrombocytopenia (187.4x10(3)+/- 137.2x10(3)) and anemia (5.0x10(6)+/- 1.39x10(6)/ul) were noted. The mean hemoglobin (11 +/- 2.7g/dL), hematocrit (34 +/- 10.5%) were below normal limits. The white series were within normal variation, with the exception of eosinophilia observed in three dogs. Individually, there were two dogs which registered leukocytosis, lymphocytosis and neutrophilia. In the biochemical evaluation there was hyperproteinemia PT=7.2 +/- 0.9g/dL, hypoalbuminemia (2.2 +/- 0.4g/dL), hyperglobulinemia (5.1 +/- 1.0g/dL), increased of CK (196+171 U/L) and there was no alteration on ALT and AST enzymes. The CK-MB isoenzymes and cTnI did not change, except in three dogs. We conclude that dogs naturally infected in the northeastern semiarid present characteristics related to indeterminate chronic form (asymptomatic dogs) and that the identification of the naturally infected dogs with no pathognomonic characteristics of the Chagas disease underscores the importance of this illness in the diagnostic process with the other profiles that show nonspecific or not associated to cardiovascular disease."

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers 121/122 targeting DNA kinetoplast (kDNA) was then performed to identify T. cruzi, and positive samples were subjected to PCR using the primer pair TcSC5D-F/R followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) with the restriction enzymes SphI and HpaI (1 U/reaction), cloning and sequencing. Results: One hundred samples were positive for T. cruzi, and three discrete typing units (DTUs) were identified (TcI, TcII, and TcBat). Triatoma sordida had the highest T. cruzi occurrence (83.3%), and DTUs were found in three samples: 58.3% of the samples were TcI, 33.3% were TcII and 8.3% were TcBat. There was a clear geographical distribution of the DTUs throughout the state, with TcI, TcII and TcBat located in the center, TcI located in the east, and TcII located in the west. Conclusions: This study showed the occurrence of overlapping DTUs in State of Mato Grosso do Sul. The distributions of the DTUs were different, with TcI, TcII and TcBat in the center of the state, TcI predominantly in the east, and TcII in the west.

We investigated T. cruzi infection in wild carnivores from three sites in Brazil through parasitological and serological tests. The seven carnivore species examined were infected by T. cruzi, but high parasitemias detectable by hemoculture were found only in two Procyonidae species. Genotyping by Mini-exon gene, PCR-RFLP (1f8/Akw21I) and kDNA genomic targets revealed that the raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus) harbored TcI and the coatis (Nasua nasua) harbored TcI, TcII, TcIII-IV and Trypanosoma rangeli, in single and mixed infections, besides four T. cruzi isolates that displayed odd band patterns in the Mini-exon assay. These findings corroborate the coati can be a bioaccumulator of T. cruzi Discrete Typing Units (DTU) and may act as a transmission hub, a connection point joining sylvatic transmission cycles within terrestrial and arboreal mammals and vectors. Also, the odd band patterns observed in coatis' isolates reinforce that T. cruzi diversity might be much higher than currently acknowledged. Additionally, we assembled our data with T. cruzi infection on Neotropical carnivores' literature records to provide a comprehensive analysis of the infection patterns among distinct carnivore species, especially considering their ecological traits and phylogeny. Altogether, fifteen Neotropical carnivore species were found naturally infected by T. cruzi. Species diet was associated with T. cruzi infection rates, supporting the hypothesis that predator-prey links are important mechanisms for T. cruzi maintenance and dispersion in the wild. Distinct T. cruzi infection patterns across carnivore species and study sites were notable. Musteloidea species consistently exhibit high parasitemias in different studies which indicate their high infectivity potential. Mesocarnivores that feed on both invertebrates and mammals, including the coati, a host that can be bioaccumulator of T. cruzi DTU's, seem to take place at the top of the T. cruzi transmission chain."

This assumption is mainly supported by indirect evidence, such as Hardy-Weinberg imbalances, linkage disequilibrium and a strong correlation between independent sets of genetic markers of T. cruzi populations. However, because the analyzed populations are usually isolated from different geographic regions, the possibility of population substructuring as generating these genetic marker imbalances cannot be eliminated. To investigate this possibility, we firstly compared the allele frequencies and haplotype networks using seven different polymorphic loci (two from mitochondrial and five from different nuclear chromosomes) in two groups of TcII strains: one including isolates obtained from different regions in Latin America and the other including isolates obtained only from patients of the Minas Gerais State in Brazil. Our hypothesis was that if the population structure is essentially clonal, Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium and a sharp association between the clusters generated by analyzing independent markers should be observed in both strain groups, independent of the geographic origin of the samples. The results demonstrated that the number of microsatellite loci in linkage disequilibrium decreased from 4 to 1 when only strains from Minas Gerais were analyzed. Moreover, we did not observed any correlation between the clusters when analyzing the nuclear and mitochondrial loci, suggesting independent inheritance of these markers among the Minas Gerais strains. Besides, using a second subset of five physically linked microsatellite loci and the Minas Gerais strains, we could also demonstrate evidence of homologous recombination roughly proportional to the relative distance among them. Taken together, our results do not support a clonal population structure for T. cruzi, particularly in TcII, which coexists in the same geographical area, suggesting that genetic exchanges among these strains may occur more frequently than initially expected.

Potentially severe DI were more frequent in patients with previous bleeding episodes, based on the DIF compendia (p = 0.007). This evaluation of warfarin DI revealed that the disagreement between compendia is also observed in clinical practice.

The prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination of resistant female mice led to a drastic reduction in the number of inflammatory infiltrates in cardiac and skeletal muscles during the chronic phase of infection with either strain. Analysis of the electrocardiographic parameters showed that prophylactic vaccination reduced the frequencies of sinus arrhythmia and atrioventricular block.

Although this is one of the largest immunodominant T cell responses described for any infection, most mice fail to clear T. cruzi and subsequently develop chronic disease. To determine if immunodominant TS-specific CD8(+) T cells are necessary for resistance to infection, we epitope-tolerized mice by high-dose i.v. injections of TSKB20 or TSKB74 peptides. Tolerance induction led to deletion of TS-specific CD8(+) T cells but did not prevent the expansion of other effector CD8(+) T cell populations. Mice tolerized against either TSKB20 or TSKB74, or both epitopes simultaneously, exhibited transient increases in parasite loads, although ultimately they controlled the acute infection. Furthermore, BALB/c mice tolerized against the TSKD14 peptide effectively controlled acute T. cruzi infection. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that development of high-frequency CD8(+) T cell populations focused on TS-derived epitopes contributes to optimal control of acute infection but is not required for the development of immune resistance.

H. pylori infection was not associated with digestive or other clinical forms of Chagas disease (p = 0.27). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that chagasic patients have a higher prevalence of H. pylori compared to non-chagasic subjects; a similar prevalence was found among the diverse clinical forms of the disease. The factors contributing to the frequent co-infection with H. pylori and Trypanosoma cruzi as well as its effects on the clinical outcome deserve further study."

Genetically diverse, the species is sub-divided into six lineages, known as TcI-TcVI, which have disparate geographical and ecological distributions. TcII, TcV, and TcVI are associated with severe human disease in the Southern Cone countries, whereas TcI is associated with cardiomyopathy north of the Amazon. T. cruzi persists as a chronic infection, with cardiac and/or gastrointestinal symptoms developing years or decades after initial infection. Identifying an individual's history of T. cruzi lineage infection directly by genotyping of the parasite is complicated by the low parasitaemia and sequestration in the host tissues. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have applied here serology against lineage-specific epitopes of the T. cruzi surface antigen TSSA, as an indirect approach to allow identification of infecting lineage. Chagasic sera from chronic patients from a range of endemic countries were tested by ELISA against synthetic peptides representing lineage-specific TSSA epitopes bound to avidin-coated ELISA plates via a biotin labelled polyethylene glycol-glycine spacer to increase rotation and ensure each amino acid side chain could freely interact with their antibodies. 79/113 (70%) of samples from Brazil, Bolivia, and Argentina recognised the TSSA epitope common to lineages TcII/TcV/TcVI. Comparison with clinical information showed that a higher proportion of Brazilian TSSApep-II/V/VI responders had ECG abnormalities than non-responders (38% vs 17%; p<0.0001). Among northern chagasic sera 4/20 (20%) from Ecuador reacted with this peptide; 1/12 Venezuelan and 1/34 Colombian samples reacted with TSSApep-IV. In addition, a proposed TcI-specific epitope, described elsewhere, was demonstrated here to be highly conserved across lineages and therefore not applicable to lineage-specific serology. Conclusions/Significance: These results demonstrate the considerable potential for synthetic peptide serology to investigate the infection history of individuals, geographical and clinical associations of T. cruzi lineages."

Thus, we decided to test if infection with other T. cruzi strains also caused the intestinal disturbance. Male adult Swiss mice were infected intraperitoneally with CL-Brener clone (CL-B), Brazil strain (Br), or Dm28 clone (Dm) of T. cruzi.

The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and natural infection of T. costalimai in different environments (gallery forest, dry forest and peridomicile) and climatic seasons (wet and dry), in the municipality of Mambai, State of Goias, Brazil. Methods: Triatomines were captured in October 2010 and in June 2011, employing two different methods (manual capture and mouse-baited adhesive traps). The insects were later separated by sex and nymphal stage, counted and examined parasitologically by abdominal compression and microscopic analysis of feces. Results: Triatoma costalimai was found in three environments and in the two seasons studied. Overall, capture success of 900 traps and 60 blocks of rocks inspected was 5.8% and 11.7%, respectively. The occurrence of T. costalimai was higher among rocks in the peridomicile, where 97% of the 131 specimens were captured. The proportion of nymphs (98%) was much higher than that of adults, which were only detected in peridomicile. Most (95%) insects were captured during the wet season, with predominance of early-stage nymphs. None of the 43 specimens examined were infected by trypanosomatids. Conclusions: The results indicate a greater occurrence of T. costalimai in peridomiciliary environments and during the wet season in Mambai, Goias, highlighting the synanthropic behavior of this triatomine species in one area of the Brazilian savanna and the importance of entomological surveillance."

For the electrocardiographic studies, respiratory sinus arrhythmia was the predominant rhythm during the entire research period (49.55% to 67%), with a low prevalence of right bundle branch block (0-13%) and first-degree atrioventricular block (0-14%). The spectral Doppler echocardiography showed E and A mitral wave reversal (0.71 +/- 0.17), confirming the diastolic dysfunction present in all dogs.

The disease is caused by the protozoan, Trypanosome cruzi, and vectored by triatomine insects, including Panstrongylus megistus, an important vector in Brazil. Medicines treating Chagas disease have unpleasant side effects and may be ineffective, therefore, alternative control techniques are required. Knowledge of the T. cruzi interactions with the triatomine host needs extending and new targets/strategies for control identified. Serine and cysteine peptidases play vital roles in protozoan life cycles including invasion and entry of T. cruzi into host cells. Peptidase inhibitors are, therefore, promising targets for disease control. Methods: SDS PAGE and chromatograpy detected and isolated a P. megistus serpin which was peptide sequenced by mass spectrometry. A full amino acid sequence was obtained from the cDNA and compared with other insect serpins. Reverse transcription PCR analysis measured serpin transcripts of P. megistus tissues with and without T. cruzi infection. Serpin homology modeling used the Swiss Model and Swiss-PDB viewer programmes. Results: The P. megistus serpin (PMSRP1) has a ca. 40 kDa molecular mass with 404 amino acid residues. A reactive site loop contains a highly conserved hinge region but, based on sequence alignment, the normal cleavage site for serine proteases at P1-P1' was translocated to the putative position P4'-P5'. A small peptide obtained corresponded to the C-terminal 40 amino acid region. The secondary structure of PMSRP1 indicated nine a-helices and three beta-sheets, similar to other serpins. PMSRP1 transcripts occurred in all tested tissues but were highest in the fat body and hemocytes. Levels of mRNA encoding PMSRP1 were significantly modulated in the hemocytes and stomach by T. cruzi infection indicating a role for PMSRP1 in the parasite interactions with P. megistus. Conclusions: For the first time, a constitutively expressed serpin has been characterized from the hemolymph of a triatomine. This opens up new research avenues into the roles of serine peptidases in the T. cruzi/P. megistus association. Initial experiments indicate a role for PMSRP1 in T. cruzi interactions with P. megistus and will lead to further functional studies of this molecule."

Also 143 samples from Brazil in 1996 to 2002, originally positive by three serologic assays, were available and paired with contemporary follow-up samples from these donors. All samples were retested with Ortho enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PCR assays were performed on coded sample panels by two laboratories (Blood Systems Research Institute [BSRI] and American Red Cross Holland Laboratory [ARC]) that amplified kinetoplast minicircle DNA sequences of T.cruzi. RESULTS: PCR testing at BSRI yielded slightly higher overall sensitivity and specificity (33 and 98%) compared with those at the ARC (28 and 94%). Among seropositive donors, PCR-positive rates varied by country (p<0.0001) for the BSRI laboratory: Brazil (57%), Honduras (32%), and the United States (14%). ELISA signal-to-cutoff ratios (S/CO) were significantly higher for PCR-positive compared to PCR-negative donors (p<0.05 for all comparisons). Additionally, PCR-negative Brazilian donors exhibited greater frequencies of antibody decline over time versus PCR-positive donors (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: For all three countries, persistent DNA positivity correlated with higher ELISA S/CO values, suggesting that high-level seroreactivity reflects chronic parasitemia. Significant S/CO declines in 10% of the PCR-negative Brazilian donors may indicate seroreversion after parasite clearance in the absence of treatment."

Finally, we blood fed 213 T. brasiliensis to investigate whether CrCl3 altered the biology of this insect. The developmental time of T. brasiliensis was unaltered, but the survival of the Cr-marked group was lower than that of the control group. Differences in the mean fecundity of the control (mean of 156.1) and experimental (mean of 135.6) groups were not statistically significant and 100% of the egg batches of females Cr-marked as nymphs were positive.

To better understand features that may be influencing the interaction of T. brasiliensis with its hosts, in the present work we compared the feeding performance of sylvatic and domestic populations of T. brasiliensis on humans and on Thrichomys laurentius, a wild rodent found in the natural ecotopes of T. brasiliensis. The analyses were performed using the electronic monitoring of the cibarial pump. The blood sources considerably affected the feeding parameters. Insects fed on T. laurentius had lower ingestion rate, gained less weight, had longer interruption time, remained less time in contact with the host, and had the contractions of the pump in a lower frequency during the feeding process in comparison to insects fed on humans. These results indicate that humans are better blood sources for T. brasiliensis than T. laurentius. The fact that there was no difference between the feeding performance of sylvatic and domestic insects suggests that feeding is not a barrier for the domiciliation. Together, these findings suggest that shelter and faster blood meals are qualities of human dwellings that facilitate the domiciliation of T. brasiliensis."

Thus, this study assessed the pathogenicity of entomopathogenic fungi in Triatoma dimidiata. Methods: Preparations of 10(8) conidia/ml of Gliocladium virens, Talaromyces flavus, Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae were applied topically on T. dimidiata nymphs and adults. Controls were treated with the 0.0001% Tween-80 vehicle. Mortality was evaluated and recorded daily for 30 days. The concentration required to kill 50% of T. dimidiata (LC50) was then calculated for the most pathogenic isolate. Results: Pathogenicity in adults was similar among B. bassiana, G. virens and T. flavus (p > 0.05) and differed from that in triatomine nymphs (p = 0.009). The most entomopathogenic strains in adult triatomines were B. bassiana and G. virens, which both caused 100% mortality. In nymphs, the most entomopathogenic strain was B. bassiana, followed by G. virens. The native strain with the highest pathogenicity was G. virens, for which the LC50 for T. dimidiata nymphs was 1.98 x10(8) conidia/ml at 13 days after inoculation. Conclusions: Beauveria bassiana and G. virens showed entomopathogenic potential in T. dimidiata nymphs and adults. However, the native G. virens strain presents a higher probability of success in the field, and G. virens should thus be considered a potential candidate for the biological control of triatomine Chagas disease vectors."

Geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies, with maximum entropy (Maxent) ecological niche modelling computer software, were used to create predictive risk maps for Chagas disease in Bolivia. Prevalence rates were calculated from 2007 to 2009 household infection survey data for Bolivia, while environmental data were compiled from the Worldclim database and MODIS satellite imagery. Socio-economic data were obtained from the Bolivian National Institute of Statistics. Disease models identified altitudes at 500-3,500 m above the mean sea level (MSL), low annual precipitation (45-250 mm), and higher diurnal range of temperature (10-19 degrees C; peak 16 degrees C) as compatible with the biological requirements of the insect vectors. Socio-economic analyses demonstrated the importance of improved housing materials and water source. Home adobe wall materials and having to fetch drinking water from rivers or wells without pump were found to be highly related to distribution of the disease by the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) (0.69 AUC, 0.67 AUC and 0.62 AUC, respectively), while areas with hardwood floors demonstrated a direct negative relationship (-0.71 AUC). This study demonstrates that Maxent modelling can be used in disease prevalence and incidence studies to provide governmental agencies with an easily learned, understandable method to define areas as either high, moderate or low risk for the disease. This information may be used in resource planning, targeting and implementation. However, access to high-resolution, sub-municipality socio-economic data (e. g. census tracts) would facilitate elucidation of the relative influence of poverty-related factors on regional disease dynamics."

This study was designed to investigate the prevalence and prognostic value of electrocardiographic abnormalities in Trypanosoma cruzi infected and noninfected older adults. Methods and Results-We studied 1462 participants in Bambui City, Brazil, with electrocardiogram (ECG) records classified by the Minnesota Code. Follow-up time was 10 years; the endpoint was mortality. Adjustment for potential confounding variables included age, gender, conventional risk factors, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). The mean age was 69 years (60.9% women). The prevalence of ChD was 38.1% (n=557). ECG abnormalities were more frequent in ChD patients (87.6% versus 77.7%, P<0.001). Right bundle branch block (RBBB) with left anterior hemiblock (LAH) was strongly related to ChD (OR: 11.99 [5.60 to 25.69]). During the mean follow-up time of 8.7 years, 556 participants died (253 with ChD), and only 89 were lost to follow-up. ECG variables of independent prognostic value for death in ChD included absence of sinus rhythm, frequent ventricular and supraventricular premature beats, atrial fibrillation, RBBB, old and possible old myocardial infarction, and left ventricular hypertrophy. The presence of any major ECG abnormalities doubled the risk of death in ChD patients (HR: 2.18 [1.35 to 3.53]), but it also increased the risk in non-ChD subjects (HR: 1.50 [1.07 to 2.10]); the risk of death increased with the number of major abnormalities in the same patient. Conclusion-ECG abnormalities are more common among elderly Chagas disease patients and strongly predict adverse outcomes."

Approximately 30% of infected individuals develop circulatory or digestive pathology. While in underdeveloped countries transmission is mainly through hematophagous arthropods, transplacental infection prevails in developed ones. Methodology/Principal Findings: During infection, T. cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT) translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the area of flagellum emergence. There, TcCRT acts as virulence factor since it binds maternal classical complement component C1q that recognizes human calreticulin (HuCRT) in placenta, with increased parasite infectivity. As measured ex vivo by quantitative PCR in human placenta chorionic villi explants (HPCVE) (the closest available correlate of human congenital T. cruzi infection), C1q mediated up to a 3-5-fold increase in parasite load. Because anti-TcCRT and anti-HuCRT F(ab')(2) antibody fragments are devoid of their Fc-dependent capacity to recruit C1q, they reverted the C1q-mediated increase in parasite load by respectively preventing its interaction with cell-bound CRTs from both parasite and HPCVE origins. The use of competing fluid-phase recombinant HuCRT and F(ab')(2) antibody fragments anti-TcCRT corroborated this. These results are consistent with a high expression of fetal CRT on placental free chorionic villi. Increased C1q-mediated infection is paralleled by placental tissue damage, as evidenced by histopathology, a damage that is ameliorated by anti-TcCRT F(ab')(2) antibody fragments or fluid-phase HuCRT. Conclusions/Significance: T. cruzi infection of HPCVE is importantly mediated by human and parasite CRTs and C1q. Most likely, C1q bridges CRT on the parasite surface with its receptor orthologue on human placental cells, thus facilitating the first encounter between the parasite and the fetal derived placental tissue. The results presented here have several potential translational medicine aspects, specifically related with the capacity of antibody fragments to inhibit the C1q/CRT interactions and thus T. cruzi infectivity."

The biological and behavioral parameters of Rhodnius neglectus and R. robustus were compared under experimental conditions to estimate differences in the potential transmission of trypanosomes. Methods: The insects were observed daily to determine the period of nymphal development, mortality, detection of food source, number of bites, time of blood meal intake, amount of blood ingested, time elapsed between the end of the meal and the first defecation and the frequency of defecation. Results: Although the nymphal development of R. neglectus (156.4 +/- 25.05d) was lower than that of R. robustus (204.7 +/- 13.22d), the mortality between species was similar (63.8 and 65% respectively). R. robustus and R. neglectus quickly located the food source, especially in the first instar (2.5 and 1.6 min, respectively). Although the time of blood meal intake was similar between the species, R. robustus ingested a larger amount of blood on average at all stages and exhibited higher values for the fifth instar. Nymphs of R. neglectus bit more frequently, and they defecated faster and more often than those of R. robustus.

Objectives: To assess the frequency of ECG abnormalities in T. cruzi seropositive relative to seronegative blood donors, and to recognize ECG abnormalities associated with left ventricular dysfunction. Methods: The study retrospectively enrolled 499 seropositive blood donors in Sao Paulo and Montes Claros, Brazil, and 483 seronegative control donors matched by site, gender, age, and year of blood donation. All subjects underwent a health clinical evaluation, ECG, and echocardiogram (Echo). ECG and Echo were reviewed blindly by centralized reading centers. Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction was defined as LV ejection fraction (EF), 0.50%. Results: Right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block, isolated or in association, were more frequently found in seropositive cases (p<0.0001). Both QRS and QTc duration were associated with LVEF values (correlation coefficients -0.159, p<0.0003, and -0.142, p = 0.002) and showed a moderate accuracy in the detection of reduced LVEF (area under the ROC curve: 0.778 and 0.790, both p<0.0001). Several ECG abnormalities were more commonly found in seropositive donors with depressed LVEF, including rhythm disorders (frequent supraventricular ectopic beats, atrial fibrillation or flutter and pacemaker), intraventricular blocks (right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block) and ischemic abnormalities (possible old myocardial infarction and major and minor ST abnormalities). ECG was sensitive (92%) for recognition of seropositive donors with depressed LVEF and had a high negative predictive value (99%) for ruling out LV dysfunction. Conclusions: ECG abnormalities are more frequent in seropositive than in seronegative blood donors. Several ECG abnormalities may help the recognition of seropositive cases with reduced LVEF who warrant careful follow-up and treatment."

Ultrastructural cytochemistry, confocal microscopy and immunoblotting revealed a reduction in Cav-3 expression and an activation of ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) 48 hours after Trypanosoma cruzi infection of cultured cardiac myocytes. CD-1 mice infected with the Brazil strain of T. cruzi displayed reduced expression of Cav-3 and activation of ERK 66 days post infection (dpi). By 180 dpi there was a normalization of these values.

We calculated the mean mortality rate for each municipality of residence in three-year intervals and the entire period. Empirical Bayes smoothing was used to minimise random variation in mortality rates because of the population size in the municipalities. To evaluate the existence of spatial autocorrelation, global and local Morans I indices were used. Results The nationwide mean mortality rate associated with Chagas disease was 3.37/100 000 inhabitants/year, with a maximum of 138.06/100 000 in one municipality. Independently from the statistical approach, spatial analysis identified a large cluster of high risk for mortality by Chagas disease, involving nine states in the Central region of Brazil.

In view of the rapid changes in the features of landscape pathogen vectors live in, this issue requires new methods that consider both natural and human systems and their interactions. In this context, individual-based model (IBM) simulations represent powerful yet poorly developed approaches to explore the response of pathogen vectors in heterogeneous social-ecological systems, especially when field experiments cannot be performed. Methodology/Principal Findings: We first present guidelines for the use of a spatially explicit IBM, to simulate population genetics of pathogen vectors in changing landscapes. We then applied our model with Triatoma brasiliensis, originally restricted to sylvatic habitats and now found in peridomestic and domestic habitats, posing as the most important Trypanosoma cruzi vector in Northeastern Brazil. We focused on the effects of vector migration rate, maximum dispersal distance and attraction by domestic habitat on T. brasiliensis population dynamics and spatial genetic structure. Optimized for T. brasiliensis using field data pairwise fixation index (FST) from microsatellite loci, our simulations confirmed the importance of these three variables to understand vector genetic structure at the landscape level. We then ran prospective scenarios accounting for land-use change (deforestation and urbanization), which revealed that human-induced land-use change favored higher genetic diversity among sampling points. Conclusions/Significance: Our work shows that mechanistic models may be useful tools to link observed patterns with processes involved in the population genetics of tropical pathogen vectors in heterogeneous social-ecological landscapes. Our hope is that our study may provide a testable and applicable modeling framework to a broad community of epidemiologists for formulating scenarios of landscape change consequences on vector dynamics, with potential implications for their surveillance and control."

This study describes the most common causes of death associated with deaths related to Chagas' disease (underlying or associated cause of death). Methods: Mortality data were obtained from the Mortality Information System of the Ministry of Health (approximately 9 million deaths). We analyzed all deaths that occurred in Brazil between 1999 and 2007, where Chagas' disease was mentioned on the death certificate as underlying or associated cause (multiple causes of death). Results: There was a total of 53,930 deaths related to Chagas' disease, 44,543 (82.6%) as underlying cause and 9,387 (17.4%) as associated cause. The main diseases and conditions associated with death by Chagas' disease as underlying cause included direct complications of cardiac involvement, such as conduction disorders/arrhythmias (41.4%) and heart failure (37.7%). Cerebrovascular disease (13.2%), ischemic heart disease (13.2%) and hypertensive diseases (9.3%) were the main underlying causes of deaths in which Chagas' disease was identified as an associated cause. Conclusions: Cardiovascular diseases were often associated with deaths related to Chagas' disease. Information from multiple causes of death recorded on death certificates allows reconstruction of the natural history of Chagas' disease and suggests preventive and therapeutic potential measures more adequate and specifics."

In addition, we aimed to verify if the saliva of this vector interferes with the perception of the host during the feedings by creating a nervous impulse. Here, we demonstrated that the T. vitticeps saliva reduces, gradually and irreversibly, the amplitude of the compound action potential of the nervous fibre, which helps decrease the perception of the insect by the host. The precipitin reaction demonstrated the feeding eclecticism of this vector, with the identification of eight food sources - most of them found simultaneously in the same insect. The analysis of the electrical signals produced by the cibarial pump during meals demonstrated that the best feeding performance of T. vitticeps nymphs that fed on pigeons is mainly due to the higher contraction frequency of the pump. The longer contact period with the host to obtain a complete meal compared with other triatominae species of the same instar could favor the occurrence of multiple blood sources in T. vitticeps under natural conditions, as it was evidenced by the precipitin test."

The occurrence of congenital infection was evaluated by microscopic examination of blood and/or qPCR on blood and heart in newborn pups and/or older offspring submitted to cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression in order to detect possible cryptic congenital infection. Altogether, the results show that: i) for the three strains tested, acute infection occurring after the embryo implantation in the uterus (parasite inoculation 4 days before mating), or close to delivery (parasite inoculation on day 13 of gestation), prevents or severely jeopardizes gestation outcome (inducing pup mortality and intra-uterine growth retardation); ii) for the three strains tested, gestation during chronic infection results in intra-uterine growth retardation, whereas re-inoculation of TcVI parasites during gestation in such chronically infected mice, in addition, strongly increases pup mortality; iii) congenital infection remains a rare consequence of infection (occurring in approximately 4% of living pups born to acutely infected dams); iv) PCR, detecting parasitic DNA and not living parasites, is not convenient to detect congenial infection close to delivery; v) transmission of parasites by breast milk is unlikely.

The heart is affected to varying degrees by inflammatory and destructive lesions in atrial and ventricular myocardial fibers. Several studies have demonstrated the benefits of exercise in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), including reduced sympathetic tone and increased parasympathetic tone, the result of reduced epinephrine and norepinephrine levels, both at rest and during exercise, including at submaximal levels. It has been hypothesized that the increase in sympathetic arousal during exercise improves peripheral muscle metabolism. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to select patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) with dysautonomia on 24-h Hotter monitoring, assess autonomic function after rehabilitation, and determine whether it resulted in reduced daytime levels of SDNN and increased daytime and nighttime levels of pNN50 and rMSSD. Methods: We analyzed time-domain indices of heart rate variability through 24-h Hotter monitoring before and after a supervised exercise program. We studied 18 CCC patients (five men), mean age 57.33 +/- 9.73 years, followed at the CD outpatient clinic of the National Institute of Cardiology and IPEC/Fiocruz in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between April 2009 and November 2010. The following tests were used to assess the severity of CCC: clinical examination, functional evaluation by cardiopulmonary stress testing, electrocardiogram and conventional Doppler echocardiography. The exams were performed within a month of the start and end of the exercise program, which consisted of 60-min sessions of aerobic exercise on a treadmill and resistance training three times a week for six months. The goal was to reach the patients' heart rate target zone during training, and their rating of perceived exertion was assessed by the modified Borg scale. Results: There were no statistically significant differences (p>0.05) in SDNN, pNN50 and rMSSD, probably due to the large standard deviation observed, patients' poor adherence to the program and their low socioeconomic status, resulting in a small sample, and the short duration of the program. Conclusion: Heart rate variability parameters in patients with CCC did not undergo statistically significant changes after a six-month cardiac rehabilitation program.

Methods: Data reported to the Information Technology Department of the Brazilian National Health Service between 1980 and 2008 was collected for regions and Federal Units of Brazil; and microregions and municipalities of Pernambuco. Rates (per 100,000 inhabitants) of hospitalization, mortality and acute cases were calculated using a national hospital database (SIH), a national mortality database (SIM) and the national Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN), respectively. Results: The national average for Chagas disease admissions was 0.99 from 1995 to 2008. Pernambuco obtained a mean of 0.39 in the same period, with the highest rates being concentrated in the interior of the state. The state obtained a mean mortality rate of 1.56 between 1980 and 2007, which was lower than the national average (3.66). The mortality rate has tended to decline nationally, while it has remained relatively unchanged in Pernambuco. Interpolating national rates of admissions and deaths, mortality rates were higher than hospitalization rates between 1995 and 2007. The same occurred in Pernambuco, except for 2003. Between 2001 and 2006, rates for acute cases were 0.56 and 0.21 for Brazil and Pernambuco, respectively. Conclusions: Although a decrease in Chagas mortality has occurred in Brazil, the disease remains a serious public health problem, especially in the northeast region.

Relatively few resources have been devoted to surveillance, prevention, and treatment of these diseases. Chagas disease primarily affects Latin American immigrants and can cause heart failure and death if not treated. Immediate antiparasitic treatment is indicated for most patients with acute Chagas disease. Treatment is recommended for patients younger than 18 years who have chronic Chagas disease and is generally recommended for adults younger than 50 years who do not have advanced cardiomyopathy; treatment decisions for other patients should be made on an individual basis. Toxocariasis primarily affects children and can cause gastrointestinal, respiratory, and ophthalmologic disease. Treatment options include albendazole and mebendazole. Patients with ocular infection require referral to an ophthalmologist. Neurocysticercosis, a form of cysticercosis, is the most common infectious cause of seizures in some parts of the United States. Initial treatment should focus on symptom control. Humans generally acquire toxoplasmosis by eating undercooked contaminated meat or ingesting things that have been contaminated with cat feces. Congenital infection can result in miscarriage or adverse fetal effects. Treatment is recommended for immunosuppressed persons, pregnant women, and immunocompetent persons with severe symptoms.

In its probable origin area this species shows two different patterns of behaviour, being found both in sylvatic and human related habitats. Such behaviour is not observed in other areas of its distribution, where it is exclusive to human related habitats. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate head morphometry characters and isoenzymes patterns of two T. infestans populations, one collected in Minas Gerais (Brazil) and other in the Cochabamba Valley (Bolivia), in order to elucidate the factors that could have an implication with the different colonization behaviour. The two populations presented differences in both morphometric (head size) and isoenzymes (specially PGM enzyme profile). The insects from the colonies reared for several years in laboratory conditions, showed reduction in head size starting from the third generation, maintaining this same size in all generations after, until 10 years after generation. The laboratory rearing conditions could be similar to human associated habitats, inducing certain level of genetic homogeneity. Our results showed increase of genetic homogeneity in Brazilian and laboratory-reared colonies from Bolivia, that may be due to a selection process due to passive dispersion, followed by several founder effects episodes and genetic drift.

In this study, we used bioinformatics approaches to identify linear B-cell epitopes that are conserved among Leishmania species but are divergent from the host species Homo sapiens and Canis familiaris and from Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, to select potential targets for the immunodiagnosis of leishmaniasis. Using these criteria, we selected heat shock protein 83.1 of Leishmania braziliensis for this study. We predicted three linear B-cell epitopes in its sequence. These peptides and the recombinant heat shock protein 83.1 (rHSP83.1) were tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) against serum samples from patients with tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and from dogs infected with Leishmania infantum (canine VL [CVL]). Our data show that rHSP83.1 is a promising target in the diagnosis of TL. We also identified specific epitopes derived from HSP83.1 that can be used in the diagnosis of human TL (peptide 3), both human and canine VL (peptides 1 and 3), and all TL, VL, and CVL clinical manifestations (peptide 3). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed the superior performance of rHSP83.1 and peptides 1 and 3 compared to that of the soluble L. braziliensis antigen and the reference test kit for the diagnosis of CVL in Brazil (EIE-LVC kit; Bio-Manguinhos, Fiocruz). Our study thus provides proof-of-principle evidence of the feasibility of using bioinformatics to identify novel targets for the immunodiagnosis of parasitic diseases using proteins that are highly conserved throughout evolution.

The objective of this study was to identify these isolates. All samples were isolated from intact skin cultures and analysed morphologically, by biochemical isoenzyme electrophoresis assays and by several molecular PCR assays. Additionally, anti-Leishmania sp. antibodies were assessed using the indirect Immunofluorescence Antibody Test (IFAT) in all animals. The methodologies employed to identify the isolates, including partial nucleotide sequences of 18S rRNA gene, indicated patterns identical to T. caninum and patterns different from the other species, including T. cruzi and T. rangeli samples. A phylogenetic tree constructed with the partial 18S ribosomal sequence shows that T. caninum is clustered with T. pestanai. Ten (52.6%) animals presented anti-Leishmania sp. antibodies with titres varying from 1 : 40 to 1 : 320.

Here we present a nationwide analysis on Chagas-associated mortality, and risk factors for death from this disease. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed all death certificates of individuals who died between 1999 and 2007 in Brazil, based on the nationwide Mortality Information System (a total of 243 data sets with about 9 million entries). Chagas' disease was mentioned in 53,930 (0.6%) of death certificates, with 44,537 (82.6%) as an underlying cause and 9,387 (17.4%) as an associated cause of death. Acute Chagas' disease was responsible for 2.8% of deaths. The mean standardized mortality rate was 3.36/100.000 inhabitants/year. Nationwide standardized mortality rates reduced gradually, from 3.78 (1999) to 2.78 (2007) deaths/year per 100,000 inhabitants (-26.4%). Standardized mortality rates were highest in the Central-West region, ranging from 15.23 in 1999 to 9.46 in 2007 (-37.9%), with a significant negative linear trend (p = 0.001; R 2 = 82%). Proportional mortality considering multiple causes of death was 0.60%. The Central-West showed highest proportional mortality among regions (2.17%), with a significant linear negative trend, from 2.28% to 1.90% (-19.5%; p = 0.001; R 2 = 84%). There was a significant increase in the Northeast of 38.5% (p = 0.006; R 2 = 82%). Bivariable analysis on risk factors for death from Chagas' disease showed highest relative risks (RR) in older age groups (RR: 10.03; 95% CI: 9.40-10.70; p&lt;0.001) and those residing in the Central-West region (RR: 15.01; 95% CI: 3.90-16.22; p&lt;0.001). In logistic regression analysis, age ≥30 years (adjusted OR: 10.81; 95% CI: 10.03-10.65; p&lt;0.001) and residence in one of the three high risk states Minas Gerais, Goiás or the Federal District (adjusted OR: 5.12; 95% CI: 5.03-5.22, p&lt;0.001) maintained important independent risk factors for death by Chagas' disease. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first nationwide population-based study on Chagas mortality in Brazil, considering multiple causes of death. Despite the decline of mortality associated with Chagas' disease in Brazil, the disease remains a serious public health problem with marked regional differences. © 2012 Martins-Melo et al."

Methods: Fertility was assessed and to determine the incubation period, the eggs were observed until hatching. The first meal was offered to 1st stage nymphs. The intermolt period was also determined. The number of blood meals was quantified at each nymphal stage and the resistance to fasting as the period between ecdysis and death. Mortality was assessed and longevity was determined by recording the time that elapsed from molting to the adult stage and until death. The developmental cycle was assessed by recording the length in days of each stage from molting to adult hood. Results: The average incubation period was 22.7 days. The average first meal occurred 3.1 days after hatching. The 5th stage nymph to adult intermolting period was the longest at 193.4 days. The average number of feedings during nymphal development was 13.4. The resistance to fasting assay indicated that the 3rd, 4th and 5th stage nymphs presented higher resistance than did adults. The highest mortality rate was observed in the 3rd stage nymphs (22.2%). The average length of adult survival was 25.6 weeks, and the average total life cycle lasted 503.4 days. Conclusions: This study is the first report on the biology of T. carcavalloi that fed on mice. The presented findings expand the bionomic knowledge of these species."

In this study we compared distance-based and probabilistic phylogenetic inference methods to evaluate the performance of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) in sigmodontine identification. A total of 130 sequences from 21 field-trapped species (13 genera), mainly from southern Brazil, were generated and analyzed, together with 58 GenBank sequences (24 species; 10 genera). Preliminary analysis revealed a 9.5% rate of misidentifications in the field, mainly of juveniles, which were reclassified after examination of external morphological characters and chromosome numbers. Distance and model-based methods of tree reconstruction retrieved similar topologies and monophyly for most species. Kernel density estimation of the distance distribution showed a clear barcoding gap with overlapping of intraspecific and interspecific densities < 1% and 21 species with mean intraspecific distance < 2%. Five species that are reservoirs of hantaviruses could be identified through DNA barcodes. Additionally, we provide information for the description of a putative new species, as well as the first COI sequence of the recently described genus Drymoreomys. The data also indicated an expansion of the distribution of Calomys tener. We emphasize that DNA barcoding should be used in combination with other taxonomic and systematic procedures in an integrative framework and based on properly identified museum collections, to improve identification procedures, especially in epidemiological surveillance and ecological assessments."

He started his medical studies in 1897 at the School of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro. In the late XIX century, the works by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch induced a change in the medical paradigm with emphasis in experimental demonstrations of the causal link between microbes and disease. During the same years in Germany appeared the pathological concept of disease, linking organic lesions with symptoms. All these innovations were adopted by the reforms of the medical schools in Brazil and influenced the scientific formation of Chagas. Chagas completed his medical studies between 1897 and 1903 and his examinations during these years were always ranked with high grades. Oswaldo Cruz accepted Chagas as a doctoral candidate and directed his thesis on ""Hematological studies of Malaria"" which was received with honors by the examiners. In 1903 the director appointed Chagas as research assistant at the Institute. In those years, the Institute of Manguinhos, under the direction of Oswald Cruz, initiated a process of institutional growth and gathered a distinguished group of Brazilian and foreign scientists. In 1907, he was requested to investigate and control a malaria outbreak in Lassance, Minas Gerais. In this moment Chagas could not have imagined that this field research was the beginning of one of the most notable medical discoveries. Chagas was, at the age of 28, a Research Assistant at the Institute of Manguinhos and was studying a new flagellate parasite isolated from triatomine insects captured in the State of Minas Gerais. Chagas made his discoveries in this order: first the causal agent, then the vector and finally the human cases. These notable discoveries were carried out by Chagas in twenty months. At the age of 33 Chagas had completed his discoveries and published the scientific articles that gave him world recognition and a deserved high place in medical history. After the publication of his classic article the world paid homage to Chagas who was elected member of the National Academy of Medicine of Brazil on 26 October 1910, and at the age of 31, of other National Academies of the continent. The Committee of Hygiene of the Society of Nations, precursor of the World Health Organization, was created in 1929. Chagas was elected member of this Committee from its inception until 1933. The example of Chagas' life can be summarized in his interest that medical research should be translated into concrete benefits for human beings because he was convinced that disease had not only biological but social determinants as well. Carlos Chagas was a laboratory researcher, a clinician and a health administrator. For all these accomplishments he deserves our respect and admiration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

It presents specific biological characteristics and it is found exclusively on healthy skin. Here, we describe the evolutive forms of this parasite showing not only the forms commonly found in culture, but also epimastigote forms with no free flagellum. The study was conducted using scanning and transmission electron microscopy and, we demonstrate that typical flagellated epimastigotes originate from forms without flagellum, although the latter may remain without differentiation in the culture. Two hypotheses are considered and discussed in this paper: (i) the aflagellated epimastigotes are a typical developmental forms of T. caninum and (ii) the emergence of these aflagellated forms could be resultant from a disturbed process during cell division caused by interfering specific proteins, which leads to inability to form and regulate the flagellum length. In any case, considering that T. caninum is a parasite that is still little studied, the information brought by our study adds data which may be useful to clarify aspects on the cell cycle of this intriguing parasite that has been found in different regions of Brazil.

Despite a renewed enthusiasm for TT, uncertainty regarding its efficacy, concerns about its safety and limited availability remain barriers for a wider use of conventional drugs. We have updated a previous version of this review. Objectives To systematically search, appraise, identify and extract data from eligible studies comparing the outcome of cohorts of seropositive individuals to Trypanosoma cruzi exposed to TT versus placebo or no treatment. Search methods We sought eligible studies in electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 1, 2014); MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to January week 5 2014); EMBASE (Ovid, 1980 to 2014 week 6) and LILACS (up to 6 May 2010)) by combining terms related with the disease and the treatment. The search also included a Google search, handsearch for references in review or selected articles, and search of expert files. We applied no language restrictions. Selection criteria Review authors screened the retrieved references for eligibility (those dealing with human participants treated with TT) and then assessed the pre-selected studies in full for inclusion. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that provided data on either mortality or clinical progression of CCC after at least four years of follow-up. Data collection and analysis Teams of two review authors independently carried out the study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment, with a referee resolving disagreement within the pairs. Data collection included study design, characteristics of the population and interventions or exposures and outcome measures. We defined categories of outcome data as parasite-related (positive serology, xenodiagnosis or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after TT) and participant-related (including efficacy outcomes such as progression towards CCC, all-cause mortality and side effects of TT). We reported pooled outcome data as Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (OR) or standardised mean differences (SMD) along with 95% confidence intervals (CI), using a random-effects model. I-2 statistics provided an estimate of heterogeneity across studies. We conducted an exploratory meta-regression analysis of the relationship between positive-serology and progression of CCC or mortality. Main results We included 13 studies involving 4229 participants (six RCTs, n = 1096, five RCTs of intermediate risk of bias, one RCT of high risk of bias; four non-randomised experiments, n = 1639 and three observational studies, n = 1494). Ten studies tested nitroderivative drugs nifurtimox or benznidazole (three exposed participants to allopurinol, one to itraconazole). Five studies were conducted in Brazil, five in Argentina, one in Bolivia, one in Chile and one in Venezuela. TT was associated with substantial, but heterogeneous reductions on parasite-related outcomes such as positive serology (9 studies, OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.44, I-2 = 76%), positive PCR (2 studies, OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.92, I-2 = 0%), positive xenodiagnosis after treatment (6 studies, OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.86, I-2 = 79%), or reduction on antibody titres (3 studies, SMD -0.56, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.23, I-2 = 28%). Efficacy data on patient-related outcomes was largely from non-RCTs. TT with nitroderivatives was associated with potentially important, but imprecise and inconsistent reductions in progression of CCC (4 studies, 106 events, OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.73, I-2 = 66%) and mortality after TT (6 studies, 99 events, OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.14, I-2 = 48%). The overall median incidence of any severe side effects among 1475 individuals from five studies exposed to TT was 2.7%, and the overall discontinuation of this two-month therapy in RCTs (5 studies, 134 events) was 20.5% (versus 4.3% among controls) and 10.4% in other five studies (125 events). Authors' conclusions Despite the evidence that TT reduced parasite-related outcomes, the low quality and inconsistency of the data for patient-important outcomes must be treated with caution. More geographically diverse RCTs testing newer forms of TT are warranted in order to 1. estimate efficacy more precisely, 2. explore factors potentially responsible for the heterogeneity of results and 3. increase knowledge on the efficacy/tolerance balance of conventional TT."

Triatoma sordida and Rhodnius neglectus were the species with the broadest geographic distributions in CW Brazil. The Cerrado areas in the state of Goias were found to be more suitable for the occurrence of synanthropic triatomines than the Amazon forest areas in the northern part of the state of Mato Grosso. The variable that best explains the evaluated models is temperature seasonality. The results indicate that almost the entire region presents climatic conditions that are appropriate for at least one triatomine species. Therefore, it is recommended that entomological surveillance be reinforced in CW Brazil."

We studied polymorphisms generated by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and isoenzyme electrophoresis analyses. Based on RAPD analysis, each specimen was assigned to one of three genetic clusters. Although all sylvatic specimens from one locality were grouped into the same cluster, sylvatic and peridomestic specimens from the other two localities were broadly distributed between the remaining two clusters, suggesting that geographic population structuring was not occurring. Furthermore, isoenzyme analysis suggested that distinct populations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Low statistical values for Wright's Fst index also supported the absence of population structuring and suggested the occurrence of panmixia.

To evaluate, within a systematic review, clinical and echocardiographic profiles of patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, which may be related to worse prognosis and major mortality risk. To perform the systematic review, we used Medline (via PubMed), LILACS and SciELO databases to identify 82 articles published from 1991 to 2012, with the following descriptors: echocardiography, mortality and Chagas disease. We selected 31 original articles, involving diagnostic and prognostic methods. The importance of Chagas disease has increased due to its emergence in Europe and United States, but most evidence came from Brazil. Among the predictors of worse prognosis and higher mortality risk are morphological and functional alterations in the left and right ventricles, evaluated by conventional echocardiography and tissue Doppler, as well as the increase in brain natriuretic peptide and troponin I concentrations. Recently, the evaluations of dyssynchrony, dysautonomia, as well as strain, strain rate and myocardial twisting were added to the diagnostic arsenal for the early differentiation of Chagas cardiomyopathy. Developments in imaging and biochemical diagnostic procedures have enabled more detailed cardiac evaluations, which demonstrate the early involvement of both ventricles, allowing a more accurate assessment of the mortality risk in Chagas disease."

In this report, we discuss the major successes and failures in the control of infectious diseases in Brazil, and identify research needs and policies to further improve control or interrupt transmission. Control of diseases such as cholera, Chagas disease, and those preventable by vaccination has been successful through efficient public policies and concerted efforts from different levels of government and civil society. For these diseases, policies dealt with key determinants (eg, the quality of water and basic sanitation, vector control), provided access to preventive resources (such as vaccines), and successfully integrated health policies with broader social policies. Diseases for which control has failed (such as dengue fever and visceral leishmaniasis) are vector-borne diseases with changing epidemiological profiles and major difficulties in treatment (in the case of dengue fever, no treatment is available). Diseases for which control has been partly successful have complex transmission patterns related to adverse environmental, social, economic, or unknown determinants; are sometimes transmitted by insect vectors that are difficult to control; and are mostly chronic diseases with long infectious periods that require lengthy periods of treatment."

The actions involving chemical vector control comprehended 74 municipalities along the Rio Grande Valley, between the States of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais. Ever since, until 1975, the activities were performed according the availability of resources, being executed with more or less regularity and coverage. At that time, Chagas disease did no represent priority, in comparison with other endemic diseases prevalent in the Country. Even so, taking into account the accumulated data along those 25 years, the volume of work realized cannot be considered despicable. Nevertheless, it was few consistent, in terms of its impact on disease transmission. In 1975, with an additional injection of resources surpassed from the malaria program, plus the methodological systematization of the activities, and with the results of two extensive national inquiries (entomologic and serologic), the activities for vector control could be performed regularly, following two basic principles: interventions in always contiguous areas, progressively enlarged, and sustainability (continuity) of the activities, until being attained determined requirements and purpose previously established. Such actions and strategies lead into the exhaustion of the populations of the principal vector species, Triatoma infestans, no autochthonous and exclusively domiciliary, as well as the control of the domiciliary colonization of autochthonous species important to disease transmission. Vector transmission today is being considered residual, by means of some few native and peridomestic species, such as Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma pseudomaculata. There is, also, the risk of progressive domiciliation of some species before considered sylvatic, such as Panstrongylus lutzi and Triatoma rubrovaria. Finally, there is the possibility of the occurrence of cases of human infection directly related to the enzootic cycle of the parasite. By all these reasons, it is still indispensable the maintenance of a strict epidemiological surveillance against Chagas Disease in Brazil."

Its evolution may result in severe heart failure associated with loss of functional capacity and quality of life, with important social and medical/labor consequences. Many studies have shown the beneficial effect of regular exercise on cardiac patients, but few of them have focused on chronic Chagas' heart disease. Methods: This study evaluated the effects of an exercise program on the functional capacity of patients with chronic Chagas' disease who were treated in outpatient clinics at the Evandro Chagas Institute of Clinical Research and the National Institute of Cardiology, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The exercises were performed 3 times a week for 1 h (30 min of aerobic activity and 30 min of resistance exercises and extension) over 6 months in 2010. Functional capacity was evaluated by comparing the direct measurement of the O-2 uptake volume (VO2) obtained by a cardiopulmonary exercise test before and after the program (p < 0.05). Results: Eighteen patients (13 females) were followed, with minimum and maximum ages of 30 and 72 years, respectively. We observed an average increase of VO2peak> 10% (p = 0.01949). Conclusions: The results suggest a statistically significant improvement in functional capacity with regular exercise of the right intensity."

The persistence of Triatoma brasiliensis in Northeastern Brazil, associated with reinfection of domestic environments recently sprayed with pyrethroids, may be a signal of susceptibility alteration of this species to this insecticide. Specimens of T. brasiliensis from the municipality of Taua, state of Ceara, were captured before and one year after spraying. They were submitted to bioassays using deltamethrin. The LD50 ranged from 0.19-0.33 ng of deltamethrin/nymph. The resistance ratio among samples from Taua varied from 1.16-1.79 in the samples captured before the spraying and 1.00-1.74 in the samples captured one year after spraying, demonstrating that the two populations were equally susceptible to deltamethrin. The small difference in susceptibility between the two captures suggests that T. brasiliensis obtained in the second capture are from new invasions of the domestic environment and that the insecticide did not select resistant individuals. Therefore, it is suggested that T. brasiliensis control be carried out supplementing the regular use of pyrethroids with complementary measures, such as improvement of the dwellings and health education."

A main step to achieve success was the introduction of a new insecticide (gammexane, P 530) and the demonstration of its efficacy in the vector control. A consequence of these improvements was the official inauguration of the first prophylactic campaign for Chagas disease in Brazil, held in Uberaba in May, 1950. Even with the knowledge of how to control the vectorial transmission, financial resources were not available by this time, at a necessary degree to make it both regularly and in all the affected area. The institutional allocation of these activities is useful to understand the low priority given to them at that time. Several national services were created in 1941, for diseases as malaria, pest, smallpox, among others, but Chagas was included in a group of diseases with lower importance, inside a Division of Sanitary Organization. In 1956, the National Department of Rural endemies (DNERu) allocate all the major endemic diseases in a single institution, however this was not translated in an implementation program for the control of Chagas disease. After profound changes at the Ministry of Health, in 1970, the Superintendencia de Campanhas de Saude Publica (SUCAM) was in charge of all rural endemies including Chagas disease, which now could compete with other diseases transmitted by vectors, formerly priorities, included in the National Division. With this new status, more funds were available, as well as redistribution of personnel and expenses from the malaria program to the vectorial control of Chagas disease. In 1991 the Health National foundation was created to substitute SUCAM in the control of endemic diseases and it included all the units of the Ministry of Health related to epidemiology and disease control. By this time a new tendency for decentralization of these programs was clear. In the case of diseases transmitted by vectors, this was a major difference from the campaign model so far employed. At the same time, the Initiative for the South Cone countries for the control of Chagas disease started, sharing techniques among the countries of this region, as well as establishing similar objectives and trends, what possible helped to maintain Chagas disease as a priority among all the public health issues. From 2003 on, all activities for control of the disease at a national level are under responsibility of the Secretary of Health Surveillance of the Ministry of Health."

In the present work, we investigated the potential use of recombinant peroxidoxin (rPeroxidoxin) of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis as a potential antigen for the immunodiagnosis of human tegumentary (TL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL). Linear B-cell epitope mapping was performed to identify polymorphic epitopes when comparing orthologous sequences present in Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent for Chagas disease (CD), and the Homo sapiens and Canis familiaris hosts. The serological assay (ELISA) demonstrated that TL, VL and CVL individuals showed high levels of antibodies against rPeroxidoxin, allowing identification of infected ones with considerable sensitivity and great ability to discriminate (specificity) between non-infected and CD individuals (98.46% and 100%; 98.18% and 95.71%; 95.79% and 100%, respectively). An rPeroxidoxin ELISA also showed a greater ability to discriminate between vaccinated and infected animals, which is an important requirement for the public campaign control of CVL. A depletion ELISA assay using soluble peptides of this B-cell epitope confirmed the recognition of these sites only by Leishmania-infected individuals. Moreover, this work identifies two antigenic polymorphic linear B-cell epitopes of L. braziliensis. Specific recognition of TL and VL patients was confirmed by significantly decreased IgG reactivity against rPeroxidoxin after depletion of peptide-1-and peptide-2-specific antibodies (peptide 1: reduced by 32%, 42% and 5% for CL, ML and VL, respectively; peptide-2: reduced by 24%, 22% and 13% for CL, ML and VL, respectively) and only peptide-2 for CVL (reduced 9%). Overall, rPeroxidoxin may be a potential antigen for the immunodiagnosis of TL, VL or CVL, as it has a higher agreement with parasitological assays and is better than other reference tests that use soluble Leishmania antigens for diagnosing CVL in Brazil (EIE-LVC, Bio-manguinhos, FIOCRUZ)."

This study characterizes morphometric differences between sylvatic and peridomestic populations, as well as between sexes in T. brasiliensis specimens from Jaguaruana, Ceara, in northeastern Brazil. No differences in either the shape or size of the cephalic capsule were apparent between sexes or ecotopes. However, the wings showed differentiation in shape and size. Sexual dimorphism was detected, with females presenting significantly higher values and conformations. Size differentiation was also evident, with sylvatic specimens being generally larger than peridomestic examples. These results indicate that differences in the wings of T. brasiliensis may be related to the existence of phenotypic plasticity, and variations in size and shape may be associated with different ecotopes, possibly as a result of conditions in each micro-habitat, such as temperature, relative humidity, food supply and density."

Objetive: To determine the prevalence of coronary artery disease (lesions > 50%) in a specific population of patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy in HF functional class III and IV, who had no previous coronary events. Methods: Coronary angiography was performed in 61 consecutive patients with Chagasic cardiomyopathy, in heart failure functional class III and IV, to exclude coronary artery disease. These patients were part of the Cell Therapy Study in Heart Diseases protocol, which required the coronary angiography to be carried out before stem cells were injected. Risk factors for atherosclerosis also analyzed in this population were: age, arterial hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking and overweight. Results: mean age was 51.6 + 9.6 years and 65.5% (n = 40) of them were males. The prevalence of coronary disease in this population was 1.6% (1). The prevalence of risk factors were: arterial hypertension 18% (11), smoking 59% (36), diabetes 1.6% (1) and dyslipidemia, 6.5% (4).

The domiciliary and peri-domiciliary presence and abundance of juvenile and adult vectors of the Chagas disease (Triatoma sordida and Panstrongylus geniculatus) in Bahia state in northeast Brazil, has been modelled by automatically identifying significant multi-scale spatial patterns of the entomological data by the application and adaptation of the spatial modelling methodology proposed by Dray et al. (2006) and based on principal coordinate analysis of neighbour matrices. We found that entomological data can be modelled by a set of eigenvectors that present a significant Moran's I index of spatial autocorrelation. The models for juvenile and adult vectors are defined by 28 and 32 eigenvectors that explain 82.3% and 79.9%, respectively, of the total data variances.

Coincidentally, it is in these regions the reach of the vector control strategies is limited, and reports of T. infestans resistance to insecticides, including in wild populations, have been issued. This study aims to characterize the susceptibility to deltamethrin of wild and domestic populations of T. infestans from Bolivia, in order to better understand the extent of this relevant problem. Methods: Susceptibility to deltamethrin was assessed in nine, wild and domestic, populations of T. infestans from the Gran Chaco and the Inter-Andean Valleys of Bolivia. Serial dilutions of deltamethrin in acetone (0.2 mu L) were topically applied in first instar nymphs (F1, five days old, fasting, weight 1.2 +/- 0.2 mg). Dose response results were analyzed with PROBIT version 2, determining the lethal doses, slope and resistance ratios (RR). Qualitative tests were also performed. Results: Three wild T. infestans dark morph samples of Chaco from the Santa Cruz Department were susceptible to deltamethrin with RR50 of < 2, and 100% mortality to the diagnostic dose (DD); however, two domestic populations from the same region were less susceptible than the susceptibility reference lineage (RR50 of 4.21 and 5.04 respectively and 93% DD). The domestic population of Villa Montes from the Chaco of the Tarija Department presented high levels of resistance (RR50 of 129.12 and 0% DD). Moreover, the domestic populations from the Valleys of the Cochabamba Department presented resistance (RR50 of 8.49 and 62% DD), the wild populations were less susceptible than SRL and T. infestans dark morph populations (RR50 < 5). Conclusion: The elimination of T. infestans with pyrethroid insecticides in Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, and its drastic reduction in large parts of Paraguay and Argentina, clearly indicates that pyrethroid resistance was very uncommon in non-Andean regions. The pyrethroid susceptibility of non-Andean T. infestans dark morph population, and the resistance towards it, of Andean T. infestans wild and domestic populations, indicates that the Andean populations from Bolivia are less susceptible."

These may include endoparasites (e.g., protozoa, cestodes, trematodes, and nematodes) and ectoparasites (i.e., fleas, lice, mites, and ticks). While some dog and cat parasites are highly host-specific (e.g., Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Felicola subrostratus for cats, and Angiostrongylus vasorum and Trichodectes canis for dogs), others may easily switch to other hosts, including humans. In fact, several dog and cat parasites (e.g., Toxoplasma gondii, Dipylidium caninum, Ancylostoma caninum, Strongyloides stercoralis, and Toxocara canis) are important not only from a veterinary perspective but also from a medical standpoint. In addition, some of them (e.g., Lynxacarus radovskyi on cats and Rangelia vitalii in dogs) are little known to most veterinary practitioners working in Brazil. This article is a compendium on dog and cat parasites in Brazil and a call for a One Health approach towards a better management of some of these parasites, which may potentially affect humans. Practical aspects related to the diagnosis, treatment, and control of parasitic diseases of dogs and cats in Brazil are discussed."

Both areas have in the past been colonized by Triatoma infestans. Campos de Itapetininga remained, until the beginning of the 1970s as a stronghold of this species in the State of Sao Paulo. Panstrongylus megistus has currently colonized in these areas, now classified as having serological titer profiles characteristic of low endemicity. Transmission of Chagas disease was interrupted earlier in the Encosta Ocidental. Intense exposure to the vector in Campos de Itapetininga can explain the seroreactivity frequencies observed in people born before 1956, aged more than 20 years. Among the residents in this region born between 1972 and 1977, a low positivity rate remains, which might also include cases of congenital transmission. The mean age of seroreagents resident in the Encosta indicates that they must have been born in the 1930s; positivity levels here vary in different municipalities according to their growth in capital goods. After 1984 new criteria were adopted for the use of serology in the Program for the Control of Chagas disease, the detection of seroreagents has not been statistically associated to notification of the occurrence of domestic triatomines in these regions."

Despite intensive vector control efforts using pyrethroid insecticides, the elimination of Triatoma infestans has failed in the Gran Chaco, an ecoregion that extends over Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil. The voltage-gated sodium channel is the target site of pyrethroid insecticides. Point mutations in domain II region of the channel have been implicated in pyrethroid resistance of several insect species. Methods and Findings: In the present paper, we identify L925I, a new pyrethroid resistance-conferring mutation in T. infestans. This mutation has been found only in hemipterans. In T. infestans, L925I mutation occurs in a resistant population from the Gran Chaco region and is associated with inefficiency in the control campaigns. We also describe a method to detect L925I mutation in individuals from the field. Conclusions and Significance: The findings have important implications in the implementation of strategies for resistance management and in the rational design of campaigns for the control of Chagas' disease transmission."

Objective: To verify whether the concomitant use of carvedilol will enhance the antioxidant effect of vitamins E and C in reducing the systemic oxidative stress in chronic Chagas heart disease. Methods: A total of 42 patients with Chagas heart disease were studied. They were divided into four groups according to the modified Los Andes classification: 10 patients in group IA (normal electrocardiogram and echocardiogram; no cardiac involvement); 20 patients in group IB (normal electrocardiogram and abnormal echocardiogram; mild cardiac involvement); eight patients in group II (abnormal electrocardiogram and echocardiogram; no heart failure; moderate cardiac involvement); and four patients in group III (abnormal electrocardiogram and echocardiogram with heart failure; severe cardiac involvement). Blood levels of markers of oxidative stress were determined before and after a six-month period of treatment with carvedilol, and six months after combined therapy of carvedilol with vitamins E and C. The markers analyzed were as follows: activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase and reductase, myeloperoxidade and adenosine deaminase; and the levels of reduced glutathione, thiobarbituric-acid reactive substances, protein carbonyls, vitamin E, and nitric oxide. Results: After treatment with carvedilol, all groups showed significant decrease in protein carbonyls and reduced glutathione levels, whereas nitric oxide levels and adenosine activity increased significantly only in the less severely affected group (IA). In addition, the activity of most of the antioxidant enzymes was decreased in the less severely affected groups (IA and IB). By combining the vitamins with carvedilol, a reduction in protein damage, in glutathione levels, and in the activity of most of the antioxidant enzymes were observed. Conclusions: The decrease in oxidative stress levels observed by means of the markers tested was more significant when carvedilol was used in combination with the antioxidant vitamins. The findings suggest that both carvedilol alone and in combination with the vitamins were effective in attenuating the systemic oxidative stress in patients with Chagas heart disease, especially those less severely affected, thus suggesting the possibility of synergism between these compounds."

The proportion of infected people was much higher in areas where Triatoma infestans, the most efficient vector of Chagas disease among the five principal species involved in transmission at that time, was predominant. Similar result was observed in places where Triatoma sordida was dispersed, mainly in the country's central region, which corresponds to its native area. This finding is due to the coincidence observed in the geographic distribution of both vectors, since T. sordida is not considered to play an important role in transmission. In the Northeastern semi-arid, endemic area for Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma pseudomaculata, rates of human infection were much lower, although both vectors may have some relevance in the maintenance of the disease. As for areas with Panstrongylus megistus, human infection varied according to the levels of domiciliation. Whenever domiciled, like in the humid northeastern coastal area, its involvement in transmission can be clearly demonstrated. In some parts of Bahia State it represented the exclusive vector of the disease.

We analyzed size and shape variation in wings of sylvatic parents and their laboratory descendents (first, third and fifth generations) using geometric morphometric techniques. Sexual size dimorphism and shape of wings were maintained, but wing size decreased from sylvatic specimens to their laboratory generations. Size variation in R. neglectus should reflect the expected morphometric changes between sylvatic and domestic populations and can be applied to analyze the level of adaptation of R. neglectus to domestic habitats. This information might be useful to detect persistent infestations in dwellings after insecticide application, or new infestations from the sylvatic environment, and is therefore important to guide vector surveillance strategies for Chagas disease."

However, efficacy and safety of ICD treatment in ChD remains controversial. The aim of our study was to compare clinical outcome after ICD implantation in ChD and non-ChD patients. The study population consists of patients who received ICD implantation in a tertiary Reference Center for ChD in Brazil. The primary endpoint of the study was appropriate therapy (appropriate shocks or anti-tachycardia pacing); the secondary endpoint was the event-free survival defined as absence of death or appropriate therapy. Three hundred thirty-five patients were followed for the median time of 266 days. Sixty-five patients had ChD. Appropriate ICD therapy occurred in 32 (49.2) ChD and in 19 (27.1) non-ChD patients (P0.005). Ventricular tachycardia occurred in 27 (42) ChD and in 16 (23) non-ChD (P 0.01) patients. There was a statistically significant difference in event-free survival between the group of patients with and without ChD (P0.004). The median event-free survival was 230 days (95 confidence interval, CI: 113347) in patients with ChD and 549 days (95 CI: 412687) in non-ChD patients. Chagas disease double the risk of the patient to have appropriate therapy (hazard ratio, HR 2.2, 95 CI 1.24.3, P 0.02) and appropriate therapy or death (HR 2.2, 95 CI 1.24.2, P 0.01) in multivariate analysis. There were 16 deaths (11.8) with 8 deaths in each group and five inappropriate shocks (3.7) with one in ChD patients (1.6). The higher frequency of appropriate ICD therapy and the shorter event-free survival in ChD patients are consistent with the presence of an arrhythmogenic substrate that characterizes this cardiomyopathy."

The chronic CC cases cause now a profound socio-economic impact. However this issue has not been well studied if compared to other causes of HF. The objective of this study was to assess the cost burden of CC during acute decompensated HF admissions (ADHF), and compare this cost to the other etiologies of HF. Methods and results: By the end of 2006 we started a five year follow-up of 577 consecutive adult patients admitted at a high complexity cardiology university hospital in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. This study shows the data of the first admission of each patient of this follow-up. Patients were divided in two groups: CC (58 patients) and non-chagasic (NC) (519 patients). Mortality was different among groups, 19/58 (32.8%) in CC vs 113/519 (21.8%) in NC (p=0.046). The prevalence of signs of inadequate perfusion was higher in the CC group at admission, but in a multivariated analysis chagasic etiology and presence of diabetes were independent predictors of higher costs per day of hospitalization adjusted by mortality. Median costs per day were US$308 (277-542) vs US$467 (323-815) for NC and CC respectively (p<0.001). Conclusion: Treating ADHF patients with CC etiology was more expensive and mortality was higher in this population at the first admission of this follow-up. This could be explained by the severity of Chagas' cardiomyopathy disease. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

In addition, problems with the occurrence of false-positive or false-negative results in the serodiagnosis of CVL have been reported. The present work analyzed the potential of synthetic peptides mapped from hypothetical proteins for improvement of the serodiagnosis of Leishmania infantum infection in dogs. From 26 identified leishmanial proteins, eight were selected, considering that no homologies between these proteins and others from trypanosomatide sequence databases were encountered. The sequences of these proteins were mapped to identify linear B-cell epitopes, and 17 peptides were synthesized and tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the serodiagnosis of L. infantum infection in dogs. Of these, three exhibited sensitivity and specificity values higher than 75% and 90%, respectively, to differentiate L. infantum-infected animals from Trypanosoma cruziinfected animals and healthy animals. Soluble Leishmania antigen (SLA) showed poor sensitivity (4%) and specificity (36%) to differentiate L. infantum-infected dogs from healthy and T. cruzi-infected dogs. Lastly, the three selected peptides were combined in different mixtures and higher sensitivity and specificity values were obtained, even when sera from T. cruzi-infected dogs were used. The study's findings suggest that these three peptides can constitute a potential tool for more sensitive and specific serodiagnosis of L. infantum infection in dogs.

T. gondii is able to infect a wide range of hosts, particularly humans and warm-blooded animals. Toxoplasmosis can be considered as one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases affecting close to one billion people worldwide, but its current chemotherapy is still deficient and is only effective in the acute phase of the disease. Areas covered: This review covers different approaches to toxoplasmosis chemotherapy focused on the metabolic differences between the host and the parasite. Selective action on different targets such as the isoprenoid pathway, dihydrofolate reductase, T. gondii adenosine kinase, different antibacterials, T. gondii histone deacetylase and calcium-dependent protein kinases is discussed. Expert opinion: A new and safe chemotherapy is needed, as T. gondii causes serious morbidity and mortality in pregnant women and immunodeficient patients undergoing chemotherapy. A particular drawback of the available treatments is the lack of efficacy against the tissue cyst of the parasite. During this review a broad scope of several attractive targets for drug design have been presented. In this context, the isoprenoid pathway, dihydrofolate reductase, T. gondii histone deacetylase are promising molecular targets."

Around 600,000 international visitors and participants (as well over 3 million domestic travelers) are expected. This event will take place in twelve cities. This event poses specific challenges, given its size and the diversity of attendees, including the potential for the transmission of imported or endemic communicable diseases, especially those that have an increased transmission rate as a result of close human proximity, eg, seasonal influenza, measles but also tropical endemic diseases. In anticipation of increased travel, a panel of experts from the Latin American Society for Travel Medicine (SLAMVI) developed the current recommendations regarding the epidemiology and risks of the main communicable diseases in the major potential destinations, recommended immunizations and other preventives measures to be used as a basis for advice for travelers and travel medicine practitioners. Mosquito-borne infections also pose a challenge. Dengue poses a significant risk in all states, including the host cities. Vaccination against yellow fever is recommended except for travelers who will only visit coastal areas. Travelers visiting high-risk areas for malaria (Amazon) should be assessed regarding the need for chemoprophylaxis. Chikunguya fever may be a threat for Brazil, given the presence of Aedes aegypti, vector of dengue, and the possibility of travelers bringing the virus with them when attending the event. Advice on the correct timing and use of repellents and other personal protection measures is key to preventing these vector-borne infections. Other important recommendations for travelers should focus on preventing water and food-borne diseases such as hepatitis A, typhoid fever, giardiasis and traveler's diarrhea. Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) should be also mentioned and the use of condoms advocated. This review addresses pre-travel, preventive strategies to reduce the risk of acquiring communicable diseases during a mass gathering such as the World Cup and also reviews the spectrum of endemic infections in Brazil to facilitate the recognition and management of infectious diseases in travelers returning to their countries of origin.

The present study describes a sequential subtractive selection through phage display technology from polyclonal antibodies of negative and positive sera that resulted in the identification of potential bacteriophage-fused peptides that were highly sensitive and specific to antibodies of CVL. A negative selection was performed in which phage clones were adhered to purified IgGs from healthy and Trypanosoma cruzi-infected dogs to eliminate cross-reactive phages. The remaining supernatant nonadhered phages were submitted to positive selection against IgG from the blood serum of dogs that were infected with Leishmania infantum. Phage clones that adhered to purified IgGs from the CVL-infected serum samples were selected. Eighteen clones were identified and their reactivities tested by a phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (phage-ELISA) against the serum samples from infected dogs (n = 31) compared to those from vaccinated dogs (n = 21), experimentally infected dogs with cross-reactive parasites (n = 23), and healthy controls (n = 17).

The aetiological agent is the trematode Schistosoma mansoni, whereas aquatic snails of the genus Biomphalaria act as intermediate hosts in the parasite life cycle. In Brazil, the distribution of Biomphalaria spp. is closely associated with the occurrence of schistosomiasis. The purpose of this study was to map and predict the spatial distribution of the intermediate host snails of S. mansoni across Brazil. We assembled snail ""presence-only"" data and used a maximum entropy approach, along with climatic and environmental variables to produce predictive risk maps. We identified a series of risk factors that govern the distribution of Biomphalaria snails. We find that high-risk areas for B. glabrata are concentrated in the regions of Northeast and Southeast and the northern part of the South region. B. straminea are found in the Northeast and Southeast regions, and B. tenagophila are concentrated in the Southeast and South regions. Our findings confirm that the presence of the intermediate host snails is correlated with the occurrence of schistosomiasis mansoni. The generated risk maps of intermediate host snails might assist the national control programme for spatial targeting of control interventions and to ultimately move towards schistosomiasis elimination in Brazil."

Prominent among these protein targets are AT(1) receptors, alpha(1) -adrenoceptors, beta(1) -adrenoceptors, and L-type voltage operated Ca (2+) channels, all of which are known to play key roles in the regulation of blood pressure through modulation of vascular tone, cardiac output, and/or Na+/water reabsorption in the kidneys.

Despite both experimental and field studies having suggested that these rodents are potential reservoirs of Leishmania parasites, not more than 88 specimens were analyzed in the few studies of natural infection. Our hypothesis was that caviomorph rodents are inserted in the transmission cycles of Leishmania in different regions, more so than is currently recognized. Methodology: We investigated the Leishmania infection in spleen fragments of 373 caviomorph rodents from 20 different species collected in five Brazilian biomes in a period of 13 years. PCR reactions targeting kDNA of Leishmania sp. were used to diagnose infection, while Leishmania species identification was performed by DNA sequencing of the amplified products obtained in the HSP70 (234) targeting. Serology by IFAT was performed on the available serum of these rodents. Principal findings: In 13 caviomorph rodents, DNA sequencing analyses allowed the identification of 4 species of the subgenus L. (Viannia): L. shawi, L. guyanensis, L. naiffi, and L. braziliensis; and 1 species of the subgenus L. (Leishmania): L. infantum. These include the description of parasite species in areas not previously included in their known distribution: L. shawi in Thrichomys inermis from Northeastern Brazil and L. naiffi in T. fosteri from Western Brazil. From the four other positive rodents, two were positive for HSP70 (234) targeting but did not generate sequences that enabled the species identification, and another two were positive only in kDNA targeting. Conclusions/Significance: The infection rate demonstrated by the serology (51.3%) points out that the natural Leishmania infection in caviomorph rodents is much higher than that observed in the molecular diagnosis (4.6%), highlighting that, in terms of the host species responsible for maintaining Leishmania species in the wild, our current knowledge represents only the ""tip of the iceberg.''"

For this purpose, sampling regional surveys for regions with non reliable information were performed, as well as, a house by house search for vectors on those areas considered at risk. For this last, 1,942 municipalities from 19 states were searched, as by the political division of the country by 1980, that was taken as a reference in this paper. These activities, that were implemented as part of the routine for intervention, were completed by 1983. Immediately after, this work was also extended for other areas considered targets for infected bugs. Results obtained, allowed to map the endemic area and the area under risk of vectorial transmission all over the country. Even more, with the results obtained it was possible to recognize those five species proved as vectors of the infection, among thirty already identified. These species, in order of importance, were: Triatoma infestans, Panstrongylus megistus, T. brasiliensis, T pseudomaculata and T. sordida. It was possible also to verify the increase in the dispersion of T. infestans, an aloctonous vector captured now in states of the North-east region, where it was not recognized previously.

Methods: We reviewed the literature from 1999 to 2010 for neglected tropical diseases listed by PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases (http://www.plosntds.org/static/scope.action) and the geographic regions and countries of (continental) Europe. Reference lists of identified articles and reviews were also hand searched, as were World Health Organization databases. Results: In Eastern Europe, the soil-transmitted helminth infections (especially ascariasis, trichuriasis, and toxocariasis), giardiasis, and toxoplasmosis remain endemic. High incidence rates of selected food-borne helminthiases including trichinellosis, opisthorchiasis, taeniasis, and echinococcosis also occur, while brucellosis and leptospirosis represent important bacterial zoonoses. Turmoil and economic collapse following the war in the Balkans, the fall of Communism, and Europe's recent recession have helped to promote their high prevalence and incidence rates. In Southern Europe, vector-borne zoonoses have emerged, including leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, and key arboviral infections. Additional vulnerable populations include the Roma, orphans destined for international adoption, and some immigrant groups. Conclusions: Among the policy recommendations are increased efforts to determine the prevalence, incidence, and geographic distribution of Europe's neglected infections, epidemiological studies to understand the ecology and mechanisms of disease transmission, and research and development for new control tools.

Bowel obstruction in patients with CD, principally when the cause is SV, may be sometimes difficult to diagnosis exclusively with plain abdominal radiograph. Fecaloma impacted in retossigmoidal area is one of the differential diagnoses. In addition, the huge amount of gas and feces, and distension of the colon normally increase the difficulty to make the correct diagnostic. The use of computer tomography (CT) scan can easy elucidate the picture of SV, and can be a great tool in cases of patients with CD and suspicion of this entity. A 62-year-old man showed bowel distention and stop disposal of gas for 5 days. He had previous diagnosis of CD. He also had been suffering from chronic constipation for several years, including impacted fecaloma, with the necessity of manual extraction. Plain abdominal radiographs showed an important colon dilatation and gross amount of feces in the sigmoid colon. Abdominal computer tomography sacan revealed dilated colon filled with feces, as well, the ""whirl sign"" composed of mesentery and twisted colon. When abdominal radiograph films reveal gross colonic dilatation of unknown etiology in patients with CD, a whirl sign on CT scans raises the possibility of colonic volvulus."

This problem is particularly severe in endemic areas, such as the Brazilian Amazon. In the present study, molecular diagnostic (real-time PCR) of Plasmodium vivax was used to identify blood donors infected with malaria parasites. Methods: Samples from 595 blood donors were collected in seven haemotherapy centres in northern Brazil located in areas at risk for malaria transmission, and the analyses were performed by real-time PCR with TaqMan probes on 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems, to genotype the mitochondrial DNA region specific to P. vivax. The experiment was designed for hybridization of the cytochrome c oxidase genes of the mitochondrial genome (GenBank GI63022502). The serological data were obtained using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay - ELISA (Anti-HIV, Anti-HTLV I-II; Anti-HVC, HBsAg, Anti-HBc, Chagas disease) and VDRL (Syphilis) from the Blood Bank System of the Haematology and Haemotherapy Centre of Para. Results: The assay identified eight individuals in the sample (1.34%) infected with P. vivax at the time of blood donation. This percentage was higher than the altered serological results (reactive or inconclusive) of the prevalence of anti-HIV (0.67%), anti-hepatitis C virus (0.34%), anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (0.67%), anti-human T-lymphotropic virus I/II (1.18%), anti-Chagas disease (0.17%) and syphilis (VDRL) (0.50%), but not higher than anti-hepatitis B core antigen antibodies (4.37%). This result indicates the need to use more sensitive methods of diagnosing malaria in blood banks. Conclusion: The real-time PCR with TaqMan probes enabled the identification of P. vivax in a high proportion of clinically healthy donors, highlighting the potential risk for transfusion-transmitted malaria. Additionally, this molecular diagnostic tool can be adopted as a new laboratory screening method in haemotherapy centres, especially in malaria-endemic areas."

This study investigated the magnitude, temporal trends and spatial distribution of mortality related to VL in Brazil. Methods: We performed a study based on secondary data obtained from the Brazilian Mortality Information System. We included all deaths in Brazil from 2000 to 2011, in which VL was recorded as cause of death. We present epidemiological characteristics, trend analysis of mortality and case fatality rates by joinpoint regression models, and spatial analysis using municipalities as geographical units of analysis. Results: In the study period, 12,491,280 deaths were recorded in Brazil. VL was mentioned in 3,322 (0.03%) deaths. Average annual age-adjusted mortality rate was 0.15 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants and case fatality rate 8.1%. Highest mortality rates were observed in males (0.19 deaths/100,000 inhabitants), <1 year-olds (1.03 deaths/100,000 inhabitants) and residents in Northeast region (0.30 deaths/100,000 inhabitants). Highest case fatality rates were observed in males (8.8%), >= 70 year-olds (43.8%) and residents in South region (17.7%). Mortality and case fatality rates showed a significant increase in Brazil over the period, with different patterns between regions: increasing mortality rates in the North (Annual Percent Change - APC: 9.4%; 95% confidence interval - CI: 5.3 to 13.6), and Southeast (APC: 8.1%; 95% CI: 2.6 to 13.9); and increasing case fatality rates in the Northeast (APC: 4.0%; 95% CI: 0.8 to 7.4). Spatial analysis identified a major cluster of high mortality encompassing a wide geographic range in North and Northeast Brazil. Conclusions: Despite ongoing control strategies, mortality related to VL in Brazil is increasing. Mortality and case fatality vary considerably between regions, and surveillance and control measures should be prioritized in high-risk clusters. Early diagnosis and treatment are fundamental strategies for reducing case fatality of VL in Brazil."

All currently available treatments present severe toxic side effects, require long-term compliance, cause serious side effects and are uncomfortable for patients. Leishmania amazonensis, a species endemic to Brazil, causes severe localised or diffuse skin lesions in humans. Owing to the unsatisfactory nature of the currently available chemotherapies, new approaches have been assessed for improved therapeutic intervention strategies against leishmaniasis. Miltefosine is an alkylphospholipid analogue that exhibits potent activity against the different clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the long-term efficacy of miltefosine in BALB/c mice infected with L. amazonensis owing to the lack of a profound study demonstrating its dose-dependent and long-term effects. It was observed that animals treated with 20-50 mg/kg/day of miltefosine exhibited a significant dose-dependent reduction in lesion size; furthermore, in mice receiving higher doses, lesions disappeared after the end of treatment. To confirm a possible parasitological cure, mice up to 250 days after the end of treatment were analysed. No lesions or presence of parasite DNA were found in mice treated with 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg/day of miltefosine. In summary, these results show that miltefosine may be used to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. amazonensis, alone or as combination therapy.

In Brazil, 6 million individuals are infected with Schistosoma mansoni. Furthermore, as the prevalence of S. mansoni infections is increasing, approximately 26 million citizens in 19 Brazilian states are at risk for infection. Schistosomiasis disease control involves predominately the administration of a single drug, praziquantel. Although praziquantel exhibits chemotherapeutic efficacy and safety, its massive use in endemic zones, the possibility of the emergence of drug-resistant Schistosoma parasites, and the lack of another efficacious antischistosomal drug demand the discovery of new schistosomicidal compounds. First developed as anti-tumor drug, miltefosine is an alkylphospholipid derivative that exhibits bioactivity against Leishmania and Trypanosoma parasites, free-living protozoa, bacteria, and fungi. With its anti-parasite activity, miltefosine was the first orally administered drug against visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis approved. Previously, by means of the MTT cytotoxic assay and a DNA fragmentation test, we verified that, at doses of 100 and 200 mu M (40 and 80 mu g/mL), miltefosine exhibited in vitro schistosomicidal activity against adult S. mansoni worms. Here, we present ultrastructural evidence of rapid, severe miltefosine-induced surface membrane damage in S. mansoni following drug treatment. The number of dead parasites was concentration- and time-dependent following miltefosine treatment. At a miltefosine concentration of 200 mu M (similar to 80 mu g/mL), in vitro parasite killing was initiated as early as 3 h post-incubation, and it was maximal after 24 h of treatment. The parasite death was preceded by progressive surface membrane damage, characterized by tegument peeling, spine reduction and erosion, blister formation and rupture, and the emergence of holes. According to our present results, miltefosine is very effective at inducing membrane destruction of S. mansoni with a short onset of pharmacological action."

T. sherlocki has shorter wings than T. juazeirensis: a characteristic that possibly implies in reduced flight dispersion, however, this species has been found to invade and colonize homes in Bahia, Brazil. Here, we tested the flight potential of T. sherlocki, compared to that of T. juazeirensis and laboratory-bred hybrids. insects were kept in an apparatus designed to distinguish flyers from nonflyers. Fifty-one and 53% of T. juazeirensis and hybrids were flyers respectively, whereas no T. sherlocki were recorded to fly. Morphometric analysis of the main structures associated with the locomotor abilities showed that hybrids exhibited intermediate size for most of characters. The width of pronotum of both hybrids and T. juazeirensis was significantly larger than T. sherlocki. We suggested that lack of flight ability of T. sherlocki is possibly a result of reduced wing size and distinct shape, combined with undeveloped flight muscles in a shorter thoracic box. The mobility of T. sherlocki might be compensated by its significantly longer legs, and may possibly increase its ability to invade human dwellings by active dispersion. What is more, this study showed that hybrids between T. sherloki and T. juazeirensis have intermediate morphological characters that may give them higher fitness than their parents, and thus may advance the process of house infestation by either fight or walking in case of an eventual natural hybridization.

The compounds thymol and eugenol were chosen to be starting compounds to synthesize acetyl and benzoyl derivatives and to test their antileishmanial activity in vitro and in vivo against L. i. chagasi. A screening assay using luciferase-expressing promastigotes was used to measure the growth inhibition of promastigotes, and an ELISA in situ was performed to evaluate the growth inhibition of amastigote. For the in vivo assay, thymol and eugenol derivatives were given IP to BALB/c mice at 100 mg/kg/day for 30 days. The thymol derivatives demonstrated the greater activity than the eugenol derivatives, and benzoyl-thymol was the best inhibitor (8.67 +/- 0.28 mu g/mL). All compounds demonstrated similar activity against amastigotes, and acetyl-thymol was more active than thymol and the positive control drug amphotericin B. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of Leishmania amastigote only in the spleen but not the liver of mice treated with acetyl-thymol. Thus, these synthesized derivatives demonstrated anti-leishmanial activity both in vitro and in vivo. These may constitute useful compounds to generate new agents for treatment of leishmaniasis.

We calculated crude and age-adjusted mortality rates (per 100,000 inhabitants), and proportional mortality rates. Trends over time were assessed using joinpoint regression models. Over the 12-year study period, 12,491,280 deaths were recorded in Brazil. Schistosomiasis was mentioned in 8,756 deaths, including in 6,319 (72.2%) as an underlying cause and in 2,437 (27.8%) as an associated cause. The average annual age-adjusted mortality rate was 0.49 deaths/100,000 inhabitants (95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.52) and proportional mortality rate was 0.070% (95% confidence interval: 0.069-0.072).

In Brazil, the major vector of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi (Cunha & Chagas, 1934) is Lutzomyia longipalpis. Barra do Garcas, State of Mato Grosso, was designated as a priority area by the Brazilian Ministry of Health for american visceral leishmaniasis, and it is important to identify the vector species present in this municipality. Our objective was to raise sandflies and study the influence of environmental variables on the vector density of Lutzomyia longipalpis. Methods: We performed entomological monitoring in 3 districts using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps and recorded human cases of american visceral leishmaniasis in the city. We calculated the relative frequency and richness of sandflies and applied a transfer function model to the vector density correlate with relative humidity. Results: The sandfly population was composed of 2 genera and 27 species, totaling 8,097 individuals. Monitoring identified Lutzomyia longipalpis (44%), followed by Lutzomyia lenti (18.9%), Lutzomyia whitmani (13.9%), Lutzomyia carmelinoi (9.1%), Lutzomyia evandroi (5.1%), Lutzomyia termitophila (3.3%), Lutzomyia sordellii (1.9%), and 20 other species (<4%). The male: female ratio was 3.5:1. We observed high species diversity (Da = 6.65). Lutzomyia longipalpis showed occurrence peaks during the rainy season; there was a temporal correlation with humidity, but not with frequency or temperature. Conclusions: The presence of Lutzomyia longipalpis in the urban area of Barra do Garcas underscores the changing disease profile, which was previously restricted to the wild environment."

Among 82 (4.7%) cases with infections, the most frequent was tuberculosis (2.0%), followed by systemic protozoal infections (0.7%), toxoplasmosis (0.4%) and visceral leishmaniasis (0.3%). Systemic fungal infections occurred in 0.6%, of which 0.4% were cryptococcosis and 0.2% were histoplasmosis. Dengue was the only systemic viral infection and was registered in two cases (0.1%), of which one was classified as the classic form and the other as dengue haemorrhagic fever. Nocardiosis was described in one case (0.05%). The infectious agents most frequently associated with diarrhoea were Blastocystis sp., Schistosoma mansoni and Strongyloides stercoralis.

In the epidemiological context of human visceral leishmaniasis, dogs are considered the main reservoir of Leishmania parasites; therefore, dogs must be epidemiologically monitored constantly in endemic areas. Furthermore, dog to human transmission has been correlated with emerging urbanization and increasing rates of leishmaniasis infection worldwide. Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum (L chagasi) is the etiologic agent of visceral leishmaniasis in the New World. In this work, a new L (14 infantum (L chagasi) recombinant antigen, named ATP diphosphohydrolase (rLic-NTPDase-2), intended for use in the immunodiagnosis of CVL was produced and validated. The extracellular domain of ATP diphosphohydrolase was cloned and expressed in the pET21b-Escherichia coli expression system. Indirect ELISA assays were used to detect the purified rLic-NTPDase-2 antigen using a standard canine sera library. This library contained CVL-positive samples, leishmaniasis-negative samples and samples from Trypanosoma cruzi-infected dogs. The results show a high sensitivity of 100% (95% CI = 92.60-100.0%) and a high specificity of 100% (95% CI = 86.77-100.0%), with a high degree of confidence (k = 1).

Leishmania chagasi). Following parasite inoculation, individuals may experience asymptomatic infection, raising the possibility of parasite transmission through the transfusion of contaminated blood products. In the present work, we evaluated the prevalence of asymptomatic Leishmania infection among blood donors in Salvador, northeastern Brazil. Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from 700 blood donors attending the Blood Bank of Bahia (HEMOBA/SESAB), from January to September 2010. We evaluated anti-Leishmania serology by ELISA, employing Soluble Leishmania Antigen (sensitivity 90% and specificity 95%). The presence of parasite DNA was determined by qPCR, targeting a single copy gene (G6PD), and by end-point PCR, targeting multiple targets, namely a segment located in the Leishmania rRNA locus (ITS) and the conserved region of kinetoplastid DNA (kDNA) minicircles. Results: The blood-donor population was comprised of 74.5% of males with a mean age of 34 years. Anti-Leishmania serology by ELISA was positive in 5.4% (38/700) individuals. One individual was also positive for Chagas' disease and another tested positive for Syphilis. Employing qPCR, parasite DNA was not found in any of 38 seropositive samples. However, by ITS PCR, 8/38 (21%) samples were positive and this positivity increased to 26/38 (68%) when we targeted kDNA amplification. Agreement between both techniques (ITS and kDNA PCR) was fair (kappa = 0.219). Conclusions: These results indicate that asymptomatic infection is present among the blood donor population of Salvador, a finding that warrants a broader discussion regarding the need to implement specific screening strategies."

Light microscopical investigations revealed incorporation of tachyzoites into the macrophages and gradual destruction of the infected macrophage culture. Parasite multiplication was observed by a quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) based on the 529-bp fragment specific for T. gondii. Samples were drawn 1 h post infectionem (p.i.), as well as 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h p.i. The parasite replication curve showed a transient decrease of parasite stages 12 h p.i. followed by a tachyzoite multiplication. The comparison of different culture conditions showed a significantly higher replication rate of T. gondii at 37 A degrees C (median value 48 h p.i., 289.2 % of the initial tachyzoite number) compared to cultures incubated at 40 A degrees C (median value 48 h p.i., 73.1 % of the initial tachyzoite number) throughout the observation period (P < 0.05). In general, replication rates were significantly lower than in a standard VERO cell cultures at 37 A degrees C (P < 0.05). The observed differences were attributed to the physiological chicken macrophage reaction at 40 A degrees C probably approximating the situation in vivo."

Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted among those newly diagnosed with leprosy in 79 endemic municipalities in the state of Tocantins, central Brazil. Individuals were identified through the National Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN) database and interviewed with structured questionnaires. Results: In total, 224(20.9%) out of 1070 individuals relocated after their diagnosis with leprosy. Respondents moved to another neighbourhood in the same municipality (n = 178, 79.5%), followed by another municipality in Tocantins state (n = 26, 11.6%) and in another state (n = 11, 4.9%). The primary motives and/or determinants for relocation were: home ownership (n = 55, 28.4%), familial reasons (n = 43, 19.2%), to seek better living conditions (n = 27, 13.9%), employment (n = 26, 11.6%), and better neighbourhood (n = 22, 9.8%).

A serologic survey of rural domestic dogs and maned wolves was conducted to document exposure to canine pathogens in southeastern Santiago del Estero, Argentina, with a parallel questionnaire of knowledge, attitudes, and perception of local villagers in relation to maned wolves. The three maned wolves examined had evidence of exposure to canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, Leptospira interrogans spp., and Dirofilaria immitis. Dogs had very high seroprevalence for Neospora caninum and canine coronavirus (67%), canine adenovirus (59%), D. immitis (58%), canine distemper virus (57%), Toxoplasma gondii (33%), and L. interrogans spp. (20%). Antibodies for canine parvovirus, Brucella canis and Trypanosoma cruzi were rare or absent. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that dog seroprevalence was not significantly associated with age, sex, and function for any of the pathogens investigated. The frequency distribution of seroreactivity to specific pathogens per dog was highly aggregated. Villagers considered that illegal trade, hunting, vehicular collisions, and interactions with dogs were the most serious local threats for maned wolves. The multiple threats faced by the maned wolf populations in southeastern Santiago del Estero suggest that their populations are unlikely to remain viable unless specific protection measures are taken."

Relationships to maternal responses and pre-treatment infection intensities were examined, and responses were compared between the offspring of women who did, or did not receive praziquantel treatment during pregnancy. Results: Of 388 S. mansoni-infected women studied, samples were obtained at age one year from 215 of their infants. Stool examination for S. mansoni eggs was negative for all infants. Cord and infant samples were characterised by very low cytokine production in response to schistosome antigens with the exception of cord IL-10 responses, which were substantial. Cord and infant cytokine responses showed no association with maternal responses. As expected, cord blood levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G to SWA and SEA were high and correlated with maternal antibodies. However, by age one year IgG levels had waned and were hardly detectable. Praziquantel treatment during pregnancy showed no effect on cytokine responses or antibodies levels to SWA or SEA either in cord blood or at age one year, except for IgG1 to SWA, which was elevated in infants of treated mothers, reflecting maternal levels. There was some evidence that maternal infection intensity was positively associated with cord blood IL-5 and IL-13 responses to SWA, and IL-5 responses to SEA, and that this association was modified by treatment with praziquantel. Conclusions: Despite strong effects on maternal infection intensity and maternal immune responses, praziquantel treatment of infected women during pregnancy had no effect on anti-schistosome immune responses among offspring by age one year. Whether the treatment will impact upon the offspring's responses on exposure to primary schistosome infection remains to be elucidated."

Except for anti Laminin-332 mucous membrane pemphigoid, adequate evidence has been lacking for the tissue injury potential of laminin-specific antibodies and the pathogenic epitopes. We evaluated the pathogenic potential of antibodies targeting Laminin gamma 1, a major constituent of basement membranes and the main antigen in anti Laminin gamma 1 pemphigoid. Rabbit antibodies were generated against fragments of the N-terminus and C-terminus of murine laminin gamma 1, and their ability to disrupt Ligand interactions and/or to activate complement and granulocytes was assessed using previously established ex vivo assays. Our findings document a pathogenic potential of antibodies targeting the laminin gamma 1 N-terminus. These antibodies interfere with the binding of nidogen to Laminin and can activate granulocytes and the complement cascade. We detected antibodies with different degrees of reactivity with laminin gamma 1 N-terminus in patients with anti Laminin gamma 1 pemphigoid, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and scleroderma. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the tissue damage associated with Laminin autoimmunity and could facilitate development of appropriate diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies."

Through extremely low cost national programs of disease mapping and mass drug administration (MDA) for the seven most common NTDs, integrated NTD control and elimination efforts are now in place in more than 14 countries through the support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the British Department for International Development (DFID), and the Global Network for NTDs and its partners. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 2008 some 670 million people in 75 countries received NTD treatments through these and other sponsored programs. With continued successes the next decade could witness the global elimination of blinding trachoma, human Africa trypanosomiasis (HAT), lymphatic filariasis (LF), onchocerciasis, trachoma, and leprosy as public health problems, in addition to the eradication of dracunculiasis. For other high prevalence NTDs, including hookworm infection, schistosomiasis. Chagas disease and leishmaniasis, new drugs and vaccines may still be required. Increasingly it is recognized that the high prevalence NTDs exhibit extensive geographic overlap and polyparasitism is commonly found throughout the world's low income countries. Therefore, global elimination will also require integrated packages of drugs together with vaccine-linked chemotherapy. Ultimately, the global elimination of the high prevalence NTDs will require continued large-scale support from the U.S. Government and selected European governments, however, the emerging market economies, such as Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Nigeria, and wealthy countries in the Middle East will also have to substantially contribute.

In Brazil, provision of HAART free of charge to all individuals infected with HIV could lead to increased testing and linkage to care. Methods: We assessed the immune status of 2555 patients who newly presented for HIV clinical care between 1997 and 2009 at the Johns Hopkins Clinical Cohort, in Baltimore, Md, and at the Instituto de Pesquisa Clinica Evandro Chagas Clinical Cohort, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The mean change in the CD4 cell count per year was estimated using multivariate linear regression models. Results: Overall, from 1997 to 2009, 56% and 54% of the patients presented for HIV clinical care with CD4 count <= 350 cells per cubic millimeter in Baltimore and Rio de Janeiro, respectively. On average, 75% of the patients presented with viral load >10,000 copies per millimeter. In Rio de Janeiro only, the overall adjusted per year increase in the mean CD4 cell count was statistically significant (5 cells/mm(3), 95% confidence interval: 1 to 10 cells/mm(3)). Conclusions : We found that, over years, the majority of patients presented late, that is, with a CD4 count <350 cells per cubic millimeter.

Of the twenty-six palm trees dissected, 70.6% of carnauba and 88.9% of babacu were infested by R. nasutus. The micro-climatic data where R. nasutus were sheltered demonstrated that the babacu and carnauba palm trees presented significant differences (p < 0.05) in relation to the external environment, except for temperature and relative humidity regulation, suggesting that the architecture of the babacu crown keeps a more stable micro-environment. The morphometric studies of the F1 generation demonstrated that insects from the babacu (A. speciosa) were significantly larger (p = 0.000) than those collected in carnauba (C. prunifera) palm trees. Also, microsatellite analysis demonstrated a high genetic differentiation between the two groups of R. nasutus (R(st) = -0.77). Our results suggest that the difference in size between the populations is probably related to an incipient process of genetic drift in populations associated to each palm tree, probably also driven by the different climatic features observed in these micro-environments.

Consequently, the HIV/AIDS population is becoming older. The aim of this study was to describe the immunological, clinical and comorbidity profile of an urban cohort of patients with HIV/AIDS followed up at Instituto de Pesquisa Clinica Evandro Chagas, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Retrospective data from 2307 patients during January 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2008 were collected. For continuous variables, Cuzick's non-parametric test was used. For categorical variables, the Cochran-Armitage non-parametric test for tendency was used. For all tests, the threshold for statistical significance was set at 5%. In 2008, 1023 (44.3%), 823 (35.7%), 352 (15.3%) and 109 (4.7%) were aged 18-39, 40-49, 50-59 and >= 60 years-old, respectively. Older and elderly patients (>= 40 years) were more likely to have viral suppression than younger patients (18-39 years) (p < 0.001). No significant difference in the latest CD4(+) T lymphocyte count in the different age strata was observed, although elderly patients (>= 50 years) had lower CD4(+) T lymphocyte nadir (p < 0.02). The number of comorbidities increased with age and the same pattern was observed for the majority of the comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, erectile dysfunction, HCV, renal dysfunction and also for non-AIDS-related cancers (p < 0.001). With the survival increase associated to successful antiretroviral therapy and with the increasing new infections among elderly group, the burden associated to the diagnosis and treatment of the non-AIDS related HIV comorbidities will grow.

This was done by carrying out a historical survey of the presence of T. vitticeps in artificial ecotopes, using data from the Fundacao Nacional de Saude (FUNASA). Monthly records of bioclimatic variables averaged for the period 1950-2000 and pixel size of 1 km x 1 km provided a reference for spatial distribution analysis. Annual rainfall and rainfall of the most humid trimester are the best indicators of the species distribution. To confirm the importance of these variables, T. vitticeps eggs were exposed to different levels of relative humidity. Hatching was found to vary significantly, and low humidity showed a significant negative effect on egg hatching.

Our main purpose was to evaluate the putative role of Thrichomys laurentius in the retention of infection and amplification of the transmission cycle of Leishmania infantum and L. braziliensis. Male and female T. laurentius (n = 24) born in captivity were evaluated for the retention of infection with these Leishmania species and followed up by parasitological, serological, hematological, biochemical, histological, and molecular assays for 3, 6, 9, or 12 months post infection (mpi). T. laurentius showed its competence as maintenance host for the two inoculated Leishmania species. Four aspects should be highlighted: (i) re-isolation of parasites 12 mpi; (ii) the low parasitic burden displayed by T. laurentius tissues; (iii) the early onset and maintenance of humoral response, and (iv) the similar pattern of infection by the two Leishmania species. Both Leishmania species demonstrated the ability to invade and maintain itself in viscera and skin of T. laurentius, and no rodent displayed any lesion, histological changes, or clinical evidence of infection. We also wish to point out the irrelevance of the adjective dermotropic or viscerotropic to qualify L. braziliensis and L. infantum, respectively, when these species are hosted by nonhuman hosts. Our data suggest that T. laurentius may act at least as a maintenance host of both tested Leishmania species since it maintained long-lasting infections. Moreover, it cannot be discarded that Leishmania spp. infection in free-ranging T. laurentius could result in higher parasite burden due the more stressing conditions in the wild. Therefore the tissular parasitism of the skin, infectiveness to the vector, and amplification of the transmission cycle of both Leishmania species could be expected."

The application of control measures recommended by health agencies have not achieved significant results in reducing the incidence of human cases, and the lack of effective drugs to treat dogs resulted in the prohibition of this course of action in Brazil. Therefore, it is necessary to search new alternatives for the treatment of canine and human visceral leishmaniasis. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the in vitro effect of fractions from Aloe vera (aloe), Coriandrum sativum (coriander), and Ricinus communis (castor) on promastigotes and amastigotes of L. infantum and to analyze the toxicity against the murine monocytic cells RAW 264.7. To determine the viability of these substances on 50% parasites (IC50), we used a tetrazolium dye (MU) colorimetric assay (bromide 3-4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-dephenyltetrazolium), and on amastigotes we performed an in situ ELISA. All fractions were effective against L. infantum promastigotes and did not differ from the positive control pentamidine (p > 0.05). However, the R. communis ethyl acetate and chloroform fractions, as well as the C. sativum methanol fraction, were the most effective against amastigotes and did not differ from the positive control amphotericin B (p > 0.05). The R. communis ethyl acetate fraction was the least toxic, presenting 83.5% viability of RAW 264.7 cells, which was similar to the results obtained with amphotericin B (p > 0.05).

In the context of universal access to care, we evaluated whether that shift would apply in Brazil, a middle-income country with universal access to treatment, as compared to France. Methods: Two hospital-based cohorts of HIV-infected individuals were used for this analysis: the ANRS CO3 Aquitaine Cohort in South Western France and the Evandro Chagas Research Institute (IPEC) Cohort of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Severe morbid events (AIDS-and non-AIDS-related) were defined as all clinical diagnoses associated with a hospitalization of >= 48 hours. Trends in the incidence rate of events and their determinants were estimated while adjusting for within-subject correlation using generalized estimating equations models with an auto-regressive correlation structure and robust standard errors. Result: Between January 2000 and December 2008, 7812 adult patients were followed for a total of 41,668 personyears (PY) of follow-up. Throughout the study period, 90% of the patients were treated with cART. The annual incidence rate of AIDS and non-AIDS events, and of deaths significantly decreased over the years, from 6.2, 21.1, and 1.9 AIDS, non-AIDS events, and deaths per 100 PY in 2000 to 4.3, 14.9, and 1.5/100 PY in 2008. The annual incidence rates of non-AIDS events surpassed that of AIDS-events during the entire study period. High CD4 cell counts were associated with a lower incidence rate of AIDS and non-AIDS events as well as with lower rates of specific non-AIDS events, such as bacterial, hepatic, viral, neurological, and cardiovascular conditions. Adjusted analysis showed that severe morbidity was associated with lower CD4 counts and higher plasma HIV RNAs but not with setting (IPEC versus Aquitaine). Conclusions: As information on severe morbidities for HIV-infected patients remain scarce, data on hospitalizations are valuable to identify priorities for case management and to improve the quality of life of patients with a chronic disease requiring life-long treatment.

Venous blood samples from adult dogs, regardless of gender or breed, of different neighborhoods in Belem-PA, were collected in tubes with and without anticoagulant to obtain DNA and serum, respectively. These animals were divided into two groups: stray dogs captured by the Center for Zoonosis Control (Group A) and owned dogs (Group B).

TrV infects haematophagous triatomine insects (Hemiptera: Reduviidae), which are vectors of American trypanosomosis (Chagas disease). TrV can be transmitted through the horizontal faecal-oral route, and causes either deleterious sublethal effects or even the death of laboratory insect colonies. Various species of triatomines from different regions of Latin America are currently being reared in research laboratories, with little or no awareness of the presence of TrV; therefore, any biological conclusion drawn from experiments on insects infected with this virus is inherently affected by the side effects of its infection. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to estimate the sample size required for detecting a TrV infection. We applied this model to screen the infection in the faeces of triatomines belonging to insectaries from 13 Latin American countries, carrying out the identification of TrV by using RT-PCR. TrV was detected in samples coming from Argentina, which is where the virus was first isolated from Triatoma infestans (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) several years ago. Interestingly, several colonies from Brazil were also found infected with the virus. This positive result widens the TrV's host range to a total of 14 triatomine species. Our findings suggest that many triatomine species distributed over a large region of South America may be naturally infected with TrV. Copyright © Published by icipe 2013."

The collected insects were identified and examined for natural infection and food sources with a precipitin test. To search the palm trees, tarps were used to cover the floor, and a ""Munck"" truck equipped with a tree-pruning device was utilized. Chemical control was performed with the utilization of a manual compression. In 2009, 81 specimens of Rhodnius neglectus were collected from the domiciles by the population. The precipitin test revealed a presence of human blood in 2.7% of the samples. Entomological studies were carried out in these domiciles and in those located within a radius of 200 meters. The search performed in the palm trees resulted in the capture of 882 specimens of triatomines, negative for tripanosomatids. Mechanical and chemical controls were carried out. New searches conducted in the palm trees in the same year resulted in the capture of six specimens. The mechanical and chemical controls of the palm trees, together with the population's work, proved to be effective, therefore preventing these insects' colonization of the city's domiciles."

It causes many losses to farmers due to death of animals and drug spending in endemic areas. The treatment of this disease in Brazil is only performed with diminazene aceturate; however it has been ineffective for many animals. During the lats years many studies have been carried out with natural products such as the essential oils. Copaiba oil stands out due some properties described as anti-inflammatory, healing, antiedematogenic, antitumor, parasitic and antibacterial. Therefore, this study aimed to test, in vitro and in vivo, the susceptibility of T. evansi to copaiba oil. Materials, Methods & Results: The oils used in this study were obtained from Copaifera reticulata and Copaifera duckei trees, commonly found in the Tapajos National Forest. The procedure received authorization of IBAMA due the scientific purposes. This study identified three oils identified as copaiba 4-C (C. reticulata), copaiba 5-C (C. duckei) and copaiba 8-C (C. reticulata). The bioassay was performed in vitro using specific culture medium for T. evansi, previously described by Baltz, 1985. Copaiba oil was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tested in three concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0%) in culture medium containing the parasite. To the control test (without oil) the same volume of DMSO (10 mu L) was added. Dimnazene aceturate was also used as a positive control at 0.5% of concentration. The counting of trypanosomes was performed in triplicate in a Neubauer chamber after 1, 3, and 6 hours after the experiment onset. For the tests in vivo, mice were infected (n = 40) and divided in 5 groups of 8 animals each. Group A consisted of healthy animals and Group B comprised animals infected with T. evansi and untreated. The other groups were infected and treated orally with oil of copaiba 4-C (Group C), copaiba 5-C (Group D) and copaiba 8-C (Group E), using a dose of 0.63 mL/kg/day for five consecutive days at intervals of 24 hours. In vitro tests with copaiba oil showed a reduction in the number of alive trypanosomes for the three tested concentrations, when compared to the control test after 1 and 3 h, similar to what occurred with testing aceturate. At 6 hours, it was not observed alive parasites in the test groups, differently from the control group which had an increase of trypanosomes compared to the time zero. The trypanocidal activity had a dose-dependent effect. In the in vivo experiment, the oil of copaiba administered orally had no curative efficacy for any of the groups; however group D treated with C. duckei showed prolonged longevity of the mice when compared to the groups B and C. Discussion: Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania amazonensis have been challenged on their susceptibility to oil of copaiba, with obtention of trypanocidal and leishmanicidal effects, similar process thet occurred in this study with T. evansi. According to scientific literature the copaiba oil increases the membrane permeability, as well as provides the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane in parasite cells. A group of mice in this study showed prolonged longevity, showing that the variation of their compositions influence the trypanocidal effect. Based on these results it was concluded that the T. evansi may is susceptible to the oil of copaiba. Therefore, it can be natural product used as a new alternative and supplementar activity in the treatment of this protozoan, as have been suggested for leishmaniasis."

Studies on knowledge and ways how local peoples use the fauna are still incipient. This paper presents both the knowledge on and food and medicinal uses of common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) by riverine communities in an Amazon floodplain region. Methods: The study was conducted with riverine communities in the municipality of Abaetetuba, Par, Brazil. The main methods used were structured and semi-structured interviews, the ""snowball"" technique, and participant observation. Results: The study showed that D. marsupialis has an undeniable cultural significance for the local community, both in terms of food and medicine. Its meat is prized by inhabitants as it is classified as tasty, soft and, in some cases, it is designated as the best bushmeat in the region. The interviewees have demonstrated a thorough knowledge on various aspects of the animal's biology, such as its diet, behavior, and places of occurrence. The hunting activity is practiced by men, but the preparation of meat and medicinal oil are tasks mainly performed by women. In medical terms, common opossum is used in the treatment of various diseases, such as rheumatism, asthma, sore throat, and inflammation. Given the importance of this species, its meat or live individuals are often sold in the city fair at prices that can reach R$ 40.00 (U$D 18,00) per individual. Conclusions: D. marsupialis is an important source of protein for riverine communities in the region studied. Its fat is used as a traditional medicine and it is indicated for many types of diseases. Although the species concerned is treated with hostility in various Brazilian regions, in the case of Abaetetuba this animal is strongly prized due to the good quality of its meat. However, despite the value assigned to the species, its consumption should be the subject of further studies, as this marsupial species has been described as a reservoir for parasites that cause severe diseases."

It can affect both humans and a great variety of animals, among which, the domestic dog and cat. Today is considered the subcutaneous mycosis more frequent in Brazil, due to the progressive increase of zoonotic transmission of the disease in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. Review: In the endemic region of zoonotic sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro, veterinarians, their assistants and owners of cats with sporotrichosis are considered risk groups for acquiring the infection. Of the human cases of sporotrichosis in this endemic region that were accompanied by the Clinical Research Institute Evandro Chagas (IPEC / Fiocruz) in the period from 1998 to 2001, 5% of the patients diagnosed for the disease were veterinarians, demonstrating the occurrence of the infection in this occupational group. Biosafety is defined as a condition of security achieved by a set of measures aimed at the prevention, control, reduction or elimination of risks involved in activities that could endanger the health of humans, animals, plants and the environment. However, small animal veterinary pratictioners from the endemic region of Rio de Janeiro usually do not follow biosafety measures, which increases the risk of acquisition of sporotrichosis. In most cases, the infection results from traumatic inoculation of the fungus in skin and in humans, clinical forms may be: fixed or localized cutaneous, lymphatic-cutaneous, spread-cutaneous, mucosal and extra-cutaneous or systemic. In the endemic form of this disease that occurs in Rio de Janeiro, the cat is seen as a source of infection, The zoonotic potential of the cat is characterized by the abundance of yeasts found in their skin lesions and proximity with humans. Cats acquire the disease after fights with other infected cats and the skin lesions more frequently found are nodules and ulcers, covered or not by crusts, which can progress to necrosis with exposure of bones and muscles. The presence of respiratory signs, especially sneezing, with or without lesions in the mucosal and in the nasal region is common. The azole itraconazole is considered the drug of choice for humans and cats. However, unlike humans, the treatment is considered difficult in cats. The definitive diagnosis of sporotrichosis is obtained by isolation of Sporothrix in culture. Nonetheless, in cats, due to the great quantity of yeasts in their lesions, cytopathological test is strongly indicated in the presumptive diagnosis because of the speed in processing, low cost and no requirement of sophisticated technical training or complex laboratory structure. Discussion: A zoonotic form of sporotrichosis has become endemic in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro and the veterinarians are a high risk group for acquiring the disease as well as have a very important role in the application of measures for the prevention and control of sporotrichosis. Therefore, in this review, specific biosafety procedures to reduce risks during the handling of cats with suspected sporotrichosis by veterinarians, technicians, caretakers and owners of cats were described. The topics aproached were: clinical care of the cat (where were appointed the recommended personal protective equipment, animal restraint and good practices), decontamination of the environment, equipment and items used in the cat care and management of waste. Aspects related to the fungus and the disease itself were also discussed."

Methods Fifty populations of T. infestans were sampled in Bolivian human dwellings. Quantal response data were obtained by topical applications of 0.2 mu l of insecticide-acetone solutions on nymphs N1 of the F1 generations. For most populations, dose-mortality relationships and resistance ratios (RR) were analysed. Discriminating concentrations were established for each insecticide with a susceptible reference strain and used on the other field populations. A tarsal-contact diagnostic test using insecticide impregnated papers was designed to rapidly identify deltamethrin-resistant populations in the field. Results Discriminating concentrations for topical applications were 5, 70 and 120 ng active ingredient per insect for deltamethrin, bendiocarb and malathion, respectively. The diagnostic concentration for deltamethrin was 0.30% for the 1-h exposure by tarsal contact. All populations sampled in human dwellings exhibited significant levels of resistance to deltamethrin, from 6 to 491 and varied among regions. Resistant populations did not recover complete susceptibility to deltamethrin when the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) was used. None of the sampled populations exhibited significant resistance to bendiocarb (all RR(50) < 1.8) or malathion (all RR(50) < 2.2). Conclusion In Bolivia, most 'domestic'T. infestans populations are resistant to deltamethrin. Because insecticide vector control is the only selection pressure, resistance likely originates from it. Switching from pyrethroids to organophosphates or carbamates could be a short-term solution to control this vector, but other alternative integrated control strategies should also be considered in the long term."

Morphological and molecular studies of six Evlachovaea-like isolates baited from Central Brazilian soils using Triatoma infestans (a vector of Chagas disease) and of other entomopathogens with Evlachovaea-like conidiogenesis led to a re-evaluation of the status of this little known fungal genus. The Brazilian isolates formed two distinct groups based on gene sequences for both the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and translation elongation factor (EF-1 alpha) genes, morphology, and growth patterns; both groups also differed from the type species, Evlachovaea kintrischica. More detailed studies of these fungi indicated that the altematingly oblique orientations of forming conidia are neither a stable nor invariant character (even on single phialides). Furthermore, the molecular cladistic analysis unambiguously placed the Eulachovaea isolates firmly within the genus Isaria (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae). The ITS sequences of E. kintrischica were very similar or even identical to those of Isaria amoenerosea and Isaria cateniobliqua, thereby suggesting that E. kintrischica is a synonym of one of these species, and that the genus Eulachovaea must be treated as a later synonym of Isaria, which must now be recognized to include several highly divergent modes of conidiogenesis. These taxonomic findings are discussed in the context of dramatic changes recently imposed on the nomen-clatural standards used to determine the correct names of all pleomorphic fungi.

Location State of Espirito Santo, south-eastern Brazil. Methods We georeferenced records of domiciliary captures of sylvatic triatomines (1996-2005) obtained from the database of the entomological surveillance programme of the Brazilian National Health Foundation. We partitioned the study area into 543 equal hexagons and attributed information on the presence/absence of triatomines and climatic, topographic and biological variables to each. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), we defined the determinant variables for triatomine presence/absence and demarcated the potential areas in which they might occur. We then subjected the hexagons with a high probability of triatomine presence to a second analysis, adding information on the number of domiciliary captures of triatomines and landscape indices that measured quantitative and spatial patterns of forest fragments. We used GAMs to determine the indices that influenced the number of domiciliary captures of triatomines. Results The presence of triatomines was characterized by a strong positive correlation with variability of terrain slope. This variable was used to demarcate the areas where triatomines were likely to occur. Landscape indices associated with the number of domiciliary captures of triatomines were the number of patches, the fractal dimension index, the total core area and the clumpiness index. Main conclusions Our results do not support the hypothesis that domiciliary invasion by sylvatic triatomines is stimulated by environmental degradation. Instead, the results suggest that less degraded areas maintain larger populations of triatomines and consequently present higher indices of dispersal and domiciliary invasion. Particular landscape patterns and dispositions of human dwellings, however, may enhance the probability of triatomines being attracted to the artificial light of dwellings. Initiation of flight and consequent dispersal is a naturally occurring process that allows triatomines to find and colonize areas that favour the survival of their offspring."

During the parasite life cycle, the promastigotes adhere to the gut of sandflies, to avoid being eliminated with the dejection. The Lulo cell line, derived from Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae), is a suitable in vitro study model to understand the features of parasite adhesion. Here, we analyze the role of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) from Lulo cells and proteins from the parasites in this event. Methods: Flagellar (F-f) and membrane (M-f) fractions from promastigotes were obtained by differential centrifugation and the purity of fractions confirmed by western blot assays, using specific antibodies for cellular compartments. Heparin-binding proteins (HBP) were isolated from both fractions using a HiTrap-Heparin column. In addition, binding of promastigotes to Lulo cells or to a heparin-coated surface was assessed by inhibition assays or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. Results: The success of promastigotes subcellular fractionation led to the obtainment of F-f and M-f proteins, both of which presented two main protein bands (65.0 and 55.0kDa) with affinity to heparin. The contribution of HBPs in the adherence of promastigotes to Lulo cells was assessed through competition assays, using HS or the purified HBPs fractions. All tested samples presented a measurable inhibition rate when compared to control adhesion rate (17 +/- 2.0% of culture cells with adhered parasites): 30% (for HS 20 mu g/ml) and 16% (for HS 10 mu g/ml); HBP M-f (35.2% for 10 mu g/ml and 25.4% for 20 mu g/ml) and HBP F-f (10.0% for 10 mu g/ml and 31.4% for 20 mu g/ml). Additionally, to verify the presence of sulfated GAGs in Lulo cells surface and intracellular compartment, metabolic labeling with radioactive sulfate was performed, indicating the presence of an HS and chondroitin sulfate in both cell sections. The SPR analysis performed further confirmed the presence of GAGs ligands on L. (V.) braziliensis promastigote surfaces. Conclusions: The data presented here point to evidences that HBPs present on the surface of L.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) technique was used to confirm the presence of Leishmania DNA in the canine spleen fragments. A comparison was made between the efficacies of these molecular diagnostic techniques and conventional parasitological and serological methods. cPCR protocols for spleen samples were standardized using primers that amplify a 145 bp fragment, located at the parasite kinetoplast minicircle. The genus specificity of the cPCR protocol was assessed by its inability to amplify the DNA of other common canine pathogens, such as Ehrlichia canis, Babesia canis, Toxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma cruzi. cPCR protocol sensitivity was tested by assessing the reaction detection limit, determined to be 10 fg of L infantum reference strain DNA, which corresponds to a range of 0.03-0.1 parasites per fragment. Standardized cPCR protocol was used to detect the presence of Leishmania in 45 dog spleen samples. Our results showed that 40% of the spleen fragment cultures were positive for Leishmania parasites, 58% of the dog serum samples tested positive using ELISA, and parasite DNA was detected in 44% using qPCR, while 47% of the spleen samples using cPCR. Diagnostic methods performance was assessed and revealed a better degree of ascertainment for cPCR when compared to other diagnostic methods. The sensitivity of ELISA was 83.3%, qPCR was 83.3%, and cPCR was 88.9%; PPV for ELISA was 57.7%, qPCR was 75% and cPCR was 76.2%; the Kappa coefficients were found to be 0.40 (fair) for ELISA, 0.64 (substantial) for qPCR and 0.68 (substantial) for cPCR. In both oligosymptomatic and polysymptomatic dogs, cPCR revealed the better performance analysis when compared to other diagnostic methods. The findings presented herein establish cPCR as the most indicated test to detect Leishmania when compared to the other two diagnostic methods evaluated.

Objectives: To determine the prevalence of falls in human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients and possible factors associated to their occurrence. Setting: Instituto de Pesquisa Clinica Evandro Chagas, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ) - Brazil. Methods: Thirty-six HAM/TSP patients able to walk at least 20 m were assessed by a questionnaire. Data regarding gender, age, duration of disease (DD), HTLV-I proviral load (HPL), frequency of physical activity (FCA), use of walking aids, functional ambulation level, the number of falls and associated injuries in the last year were reviewed. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to group characteristics of this sample according to the fall occurrence. Results: The prevalence of falls was 63.9% and we observed injuries in 47.8% of the cases. Four groups were identified in the descriptive analysis. One group was formed by faller individuals, men <60 years, independent ambulation, FCA >= 3 times per week and HPL <6.6 copies per 100 cells (group B). The other one comprised non-faller patients, women >= 60 years, restricted ambulation, DD >= 7 years, use of orthosis, FCA 0-1 time per week and HPL >= 6.6 copies per 100 cells (group D). The others two groups comprised individuals that did not use orthosis (group A) and those that FCA was two times per week and DD <7 years (group C). Conclusion: Falls occur in roughly two-thirds of ambulatory HAM/TSP patients and are associated with significant morbidity. Further studies with a larger number of patients are necessarily to identify risk factors in order to elaborate specific programs to prevent falls in this population.

It is used for the treatment of Chagas disease and as antirheumatic in folk medicine. This study was designed to investigate the antinociceptive activity of the aqueous extract (AERi) of Rourea induta leaves in rodents, as well as isolate and identify components that can be responsible for its effect. Material and methods: The antinociceptive effect of orally administered AERi was evaluated in behavioral models of acute (formalin) and chronic [complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)] pain in mice. We also investigated the possible involvement of opioid receptors and proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-Ill and tumor necrosis factor-a) in the antinociceptive effect of the AERi. In addition, a nonspecific effect of AERi was evaluated by measuring locomotor activity and corporal temperature. Finally, we performed a phytochemical analysis of AERi. Results: HPLC titration revealed the presence of hyperin (21.6 mg/g), quercetin-3-O-beta-xyloside (4.4 mg/g), quercetin-3-O-alpha-arabinofuranoside (12.0 mg/g), and quercetin (2.1 mg/g). It was also possible to isolate minor constituents' chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid and procyanidin Cl. The oral administration of AERi (100 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the neurogenic (37 +/- 5%) and inflammatory (34 +/- 7%) phases of formalin-induced pain. Acute and repeated treatment of animals with AERi (100 mg/kg, p.o.) once a day markedly reduced the mechanical hypersensitivity response induced by CFA, and this effect was evident until the day 10. Moreover, repeated treatment with AERi (100 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced the levels of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in the paw (22 +/- 7% and 50 +/- 19%) and in the spinal cord (100% and 100%) when compared to the CFA group. The AERi (100 mg/kg, p.o.) markedly reduced biting behavior induced by intrathecal injection of TNF-alpha (81 +/- 11%). Finally, the effect of AERi was not associated with changes in locomotor activity or the corporal temperature of animals. Conclusion: These data show that aqueous extract of Rourea induta has significant antinociceptive action, which seems to be associated with an inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines activated pathways. These findings support the ethnomedical uses of this plant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, can be transmitted to the offspring of infected women, which constitutes an epidemiologically significant parasite transmission route in nonendemic areas. It is relevant to evaluate differentially expressed factors in T. cruzi-infected pregnant women as potential markers of Chagas congenital transmission. Methods. Circulating levels of 12 cytokines and chemokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or cytometric bead array in T. cruzi-infected and uninfected pregnant women in their second trimester of pregnancy and control groups of T. cruzi-infected and uninfected nonpregnant women. Results. Trypanosoma cruzi-infected women showed a proinflammatory Th1-biased profile, with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-12p70, IL-15, and monokine induced by interferon-gamma (MIG). Uninfected pregnant women presented a biased response towards Th2/Th17/Treg profiles, with increased plasma levels of IL-5, IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-17A, and IL-10. Finally, we identified that high parasitemia together with low levels of TNF-alpha, IL-15, and IL-17, low TNF-alpha/IL-10 ratio, and high IL-12p70 levels are factors associated with an increased probability of Chagas congenital transmission. Conclusions. Trypanosoma cruzi-infected pregnant women who did not transmit the infection to their babies exhibited a distinct proinflammatory cytokine profile that might serve as a potential predictive marker of congenital transmission."

In 2010, Catalonia introduced systematic public health surveillance to detect and treat congenital Chagas disease. Aim: The objective was to evaluate the health outcomes of the congenital Chagas disease screening programme during the first 6 years (2010-2015) after its introduction in Catalonia. Methods: In a surveillance system, we screened pregnant women and newborns and other children of positive mothers, and treated Chagas-positive newborns and children. Diagnosis was confirmed for pregnant women and children with two positive serological tests and for newborns with microhaematocrit and/or PCR at birth or serology at age 9 months. Results: From 2010 to 2015, the estimated screening coverage rate increased from 68.4% to 88.6%. In this period, 33,469 pregnant women were tested for Trypanosoma cruzi and 937 positive cases were diagnosed. The overall prevalence was 2.8 cases per loo pregnancies per year (15.8 in Bolivian women). We followed 82.8% of newborns until serological testing at age 9-12 months and 28 were diagnosed with Chagas disease (congenital transmission rate: 4.17%). Of 518 siblings, 178 (34.3%) were tested and 14 (7.8%) were positive for T. cruzi. Having other children with Chagas disease and the heart clinical form of Chagas disease were maternal risk factors associated with congenital T. cruzi infection (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The increased screening coverage rate indicates consolidation of the programme in Catalonia. The rate of Chagas disease congenital transmission in Catalonia is in accordance with the range in non-endemic countries."

METHODS Cross-sectional study included 23 municipalities of Santander, Colombia. Serological IFAT and ELISA tests were undertaken to detect IgG anti-Trypanosoma cruzi. A questionnaire was conducted for assessing the risk factors of each participant. Newborns were evaluated at birth and followed up to 1 year of age to determine congenital infection. RESULTS An overall prevalence of 3.2% (95% CI 2.4-4.2) among 1518 pregnant women was detected. Prevalences by provinces were as follows: Guanentina: 6.0% (95% CI 4.1-8.5), Garcia Rovira: 2.9% (95% CI: 1.5-4.8) and Comunera: 0.4% (0.4-2.3). The main risk factors identified were age >32 years old (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1-3.9); currently having a thatched roof (OR: 11.8; CI95% 2.2-63.2) and a thatched roof during childhood (OR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.4-6.6); having below primary school education level (OR: 4.6; 95% CI: 2.2-9.5); and a history of a close contact with the vector (triatomine bugs) at least once during their lifetime (OR: 6.9; 95% CI: 3.7-12.9). No congenital cases were detected by parasitological or serological techniques. CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women is a potential source of infection in this Colombian endemic area. The main risk factors associated with seropositivity were related to conditions favouring the contact with the vector. The results show that it is necessary to continue an active surveillance in order to offer diagnosis and treatment to mothers and their newborns in addition to screening to pregnant women from endemic areas."

In this study, we evaluated the antibody levels against the T. cruzi Shed Acute Phase Antigen (SAPA) in 91 binomial samples of seropositive pregnant women and their infected and non-infected children by ELISA. In 70 children without congenital T. cruzi transmission, the titers of anti-SAPA antibodies were lower than those of their seropositive mothers. In contrast, 90.5% of 21 congenitally infected children, at around 1 month of age, showed higher anti-SAPA antibody levels than their mothers. Subtracting the SAPA-ELISA mother OD value to the SAPA-ELISA child OD allowed efficient detection of most T. cruzi congenitally infected children immediately after birth, when total anti-parasite antibodies transferred during pregnancy are still present in all children born to seropositive women. A positive correlation was observed between parasitemia levels in mothers and infants evaluated by quantitative DNA amplification and anti-SAPA antibody titers by ELISA. As SAPA serology has proved to be very efficient to detect T. cruzi infection in mother-child binomial samples, it could be of extreme help for early diagnosis of newborns, in maternities and hospitals where DNA amplification is not available. This prompt diagnosis may prevent drop out of the long-term follow-up for future diagnosis and may ensure early trypanocidal treatment, which has proved to be efficient to cure infants with congenital Chagas disease.

In addition, the migration of infected women from endemic areas to nonendemic countries may export this parasite infection. The diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease relies on the detection of the parasite because maternal antibodies are passively transferred to infants during pregnancy. The diagnosis of congenital infection can also be confirmed by detection of infant-specific anti-T cruzi antibodies at 10 months after delivery. Because early detection of T cruzi infection in newborns allows an efficient trypanocidal treatment and cure, more sensitive molecular techniques such as DNA amplification are being used for a prompt parasitological diagnosis of children born to seropositive mothers. In this report, we describe a diagnosis case of a child congenitally infected with T cruzi who tested negative for parasite detection both by microscopic observation and DNA amplification at 20 days and 6 months after delivery. However, at 7 months of age, a hemoculture was made from the infant's blood, and the infective parasite was finally isolated and classified as T cruzi discrete typing unit I. In a retrospective study, real-time polymerase chain reaction also allowed detecting the parasite but failed to detect any parasite load in earlier control samples. This case report stresses that even when molecular techniques are negative, a long-term follow-up is necessary for the diagnosis of infants congenitally infected with T cruzi."

In Brazil, the improvement in vector control and blood donor screening has evidenced the important epidemiological role of congenital transmission of Chagas disease. Methods: A serological survey for Chagas disease was performed in 3,952 newborns in the southern region of Sergipe using paper filter disks of dried blood samples. The newborns were screened using the Sergipe State Neonatal Screening Program between July 2015 and July 2016, and 3,749 and 750 blood samples were obtained for the IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence assay, respectively. In addition, mothers of the children who presented initial reagent serology were examined. Results: Among 3,749 blood samples, samples of two children were positive for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; however, their confirmation test results were negative, suggesting passive transfer of the mother's antibody. One puerpera was identified with Chagas disease, with a prevalence of 0.02%. Conclusions: Congenital Chagas disease was not observed in newborns in the Southern region of Sergipe. However, Chagas disease was observed in women of reproductive age. Therefore, effective measurements for monitoring and systematic evaluation should be conducted. The Neonatal Screening Program proved to be an effective public health strategy for the prevention and control of Chagas disease."

Updating surveillance data is therefore an important priority to ensure that Chagas disease does not remain a barrier to the development of Mexico's most vulnerable populations. Methodology/Principal findings The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the literature on epidemiological surveys to estimate Chagas disease prevalence and burden in Mexico, during the period 2006 to 2017. A total of 2,764 articles were screened and 36 were retained for the final analysis. Epidemiological surveys have been performed in most of Mexico, but with variable study scale and geographic coverage. Based on studies reporting confirmed cases (i.e. using at least 2 serological tests), and taking into account the differences in sample sizes, the national estimated seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection was 3.38% [95%CI 2.59-4.16], suggesting that there are 4.06 million cases in Mexico. Studies focused on pregnant women, which may transmit the parasite to their newborn during pregnancy, reported an estimated seroprevalence of 2.21% [95%CI 1.46-2.96], suggesting that there are 50,675 births from T. cruzi infected pregnant women per year, and 3,193 cases of congenitally infected newborns per year. Children under 18 years had an estimated seropositivity rate of 1.51% [95%CI 0.77-2.25], which indicate ongoing transmission. Cases of T. cruzi infection in blood donors have also been reported in most states, with a national estimated seroprevalence of 0.55% [95%CI 0.43-0.66]. Conclusions/Significance Our analysis suggests a disease burden for T. cruzi infection higher than previously recognized, highlighting the urgency of establishing Chagas disease surveillance and control as a key national public health priority in Mexico, to ensure that it does not remain a major barrier to the economic and social development of the country's most vulnerable populations."

Methods: We performed an epigenome-wide association study to compare the DNA methylation patterns of umbilical cord blood cells from uninfected babies from chagasic and uninfected mothers. DNA methylation was measured using Infinium EPIC arrays. Results: We identified a differential DNA methylation signature of fetal exposure to maternal T. cruzi infection, in the absence of parasite transmission, with 12 differentially methylated sites in B cells and CD4(+) T cells, including eight protein-coding genes. Conclusion: These genes participate in hematopoietic cell differentiation and the immune response and may be involved in immune disorders. They also have been associated with several developmental disorders and syndromes. Plain language summary Maternal infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, may influence fetal development, even in the absence of parasite transmission. Thus we investigated how exposure to maternal infection might lead to changes in gene expression in the infant, by examining changes in DNA methylation in the umbilical cord blood. We found that exposure to maternal infection alters DNA methylation of at least 12 sites, including eight genes. Expression of these genes may be altered, which may affect blood cell function, the immune response and newborn development later in life.

Nine pools of placental RNA paired samples were used: three from SN and six from SP tissues. Each pool consisted of female/male newborns and vaginal/cesarean delivery binomials. No newborn was congenitally infected. T. cruzi satellite DNA quantitative PCR in placental tissues and maternal and neonatal blood, and parasite 18S quantitative RT-PCR from placental RNA were negative, except in three SP women's bloodstream. To identify pathways associated with maternal T. cruzi infection, a gene-set association analysis was implemented: SP placental samples showed over-expression of inflammatory response and lymphocytic activation, whereas numerous biosynthetic processes were down-regulated. About 42 genes showed a significant fold-change between SP and SN groups. KISS1 and CGB5 were down-regulated, whereas KIF12, HLA-G, PRG2, TAC3, FN1, and ATXN3L were up-regulated. Several expressed genes in SP placentas encode proteins associated with preeclampsia and miscarriage. This first transcriptomics study in human term placental environment shows a placental response that may affect the fetus while protecting it from parasite infection; this host response could be responsible for the low rate of congenital transmission in chronic Chagas disease."

Confirmed seropositive women were 28, accounting for a prevalence of CD of 8.7% (95% IC 5.9-11.5). Among 29 children born to positive mothers, one infected child was detected (transmission rate of 4.3%, 95% IC 0-12.6) and treated accordingly. Other 13 children previously born from the same mothers were retrieved and tested for CD: no additional congenital cases were diagnosed. Discussion Our screening programme presented a high coverage, although widely variable in the different birthing facilities. National guidelines recommending CD testing in pregnant women would help to increase case detection countrywide."

Infants of infected women had blood tested at 0 and 1 month by microscopy, PCR and immunoblot, and serology at 6 and 9 months. Women underwent electrocardiography (ECG). Results. Of 1696 women, 456 (26.9%) were infected; 31 (6.8%) transmitted T. cruzi to their infants. Women who transmitted had higher parasite loads than those who did not (median, 62.0 [interquartile range {IQR}, 25.8-204.8] vs 0.05 [IQR, 0-29.6]; P < .0001). Transmission was higher in twin than in singleton births (27.3% vs 6.4%; P = .04). Women who had not lived in infested houses transmitted more frequently (9.7% vs 4.6%; P = .04), were more likely to have positive results by PCR (65.5% vs 33.9%; P < .001), and had higher parasite loads than those who had lived in infested houses (median, 25.8 [IQR, 0-64.1] vs 0 [IQR, 0-12.3]; P < .001). Of 302 infected women, 28 (9.3%) had ECG abnormalities consistent with Chagas cardiomyopathy; risk was higher for older women (odds ratio [OR], 1.06 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.01-1.12] per year) and those with vector exposure (OR, 3.7 [95% CI, 1.4-10.2]). We observed a strong dose-response relationship between ECG abnormalities and reported years of living in an infested house. Conclusions. We hypothesize that repeated vector-borne infection sustains antigen exposure and the consequent inflammatory response at a higher chronic level, increasing cardiac morbidity, but possibly enabling exposed women to control parasitemia in the face of pregnancy-induced Th2 polarization."

As the early stages of the infection of placental tissue and the vertical transmission by Trypanosoma cruzi are still not well understood, it is important to investigate the relevance of the first structure of the placental barrier in chorionic villi infection by T. cruzi during the initial stage of the infection. Explants of human chorionic villi from healthy pregnant women at term were denuded of their syncytiotrophoblast and co-cultured for 3 h, 24 h and 96 h with 800,000 trypomastigotes (simulating acute infection). T. cruzi infected cells were identified by immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin-7 (+cytotrophoblast) and CD68 (+macrophages), and the infection was quantified. In placental tissue, the parasite load was analyzed by qPCR and microscopy, and the motile trypomastigotes were quantified in culture supernatant. In denuded chorionic villous, the total area occupied by the parasite (451.23 mu m(2),1.33%) and parasite load (RQ: 87) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in the entire villous (control) (5.98 mu m(2), 0.016%) (RQ:1) and with smaller concentration of nitric oxide. Stromal non-macrophage cells were infected as well as cytotrophoblasts and some macrophages, but with significant differences being observed. The parasite quantity in the culture supernatant was significantly higher (p <0.05) in denuded culture explants from 96 h of culture. Although the human complete chorionic villi limited the infection, the detachment of the first structure of the placenta barrier (syncytiotrophoblast) increased both the infection of the villous stroma and the living trypomastigotes in the culture supernatant. Therefore structural and functional alterations to chorionic villi placental barrier reduce placental defenses and may contribute to the vertical transmission of Chagas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: 1,620 sera from pregnant women were analyzed using two serological tests: ELISAc (native crude antigen) and ELISAr (recombinant, non-native antigen). Reactive samples were subsequently analyzed by indirect hemagglutination (IHA). Two detection approaches were used, in parallel (reactive samples by any method are positive) and serial (samples confirmed by IHA are positive). Sociodemographic and health factors associated with the presence of antibodies against T. cruzi were evaluated using 95% odds ratios.

Therefore, congenital transmission represents a growing public health concern in non-endemic countries. Methods: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in pregnant Latin American (LA) women living outside endemic countries and the rate of congenital transmission. Data were extracted from studies indexed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Lilacs and SciELO databases without language restriction. Two investigators independently collected data on study characteristics, diagnosis, prevalence of infection in pregnant women and congenital infection rate. The data were pooled using a random effects model. Results: The search identified 1078 articles of which 29 were eligible regarding prevalence of T. cruzi infection among pregnant women and 1795 articles of which 32 were eligible regarding the congenital transmission rate. The estimated pooled prevalence of T. cruzi infection in LA pregnant women was 4.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.0-5.5]. The prevalence of T. cruzi infection in pregnant women from Bolivia was 15.5% (95% CI: 11.7-19.7) and 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-0.89) for those coming from all other LA countries. The estimated global rate of congenital transmission was 3.5% (95% CI: 2.5-4.5); excluding poor-quality studies, the rate of congenital transmission was 3.8% (95% CI: 2.4-5.1). Conclusions: Prevalence of Chagas disease among LA pregnant women living outside endemic countries is high, particularly in Bolivian women.

Congenital Chagas disease can induce high levels of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Parasite-infected pregnant women transmit antibodies to their fetus. Antibodies, by opsonizing parasites, can promote phagocytosis and killing of T. cruzi by cells expressing Fc gamma R, on the mandatory condition that such cells are sufficiently activated in an inflammatory context. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a mechanism well described in viral infections, by which antibodies enhance entry of infectious agents into host cells by exploiting the phagocytic Fc gamma R pathway. Previously reported Chagas disease studies highlighted a severe reduction of the maternal-fetal/neonatal inflammatory context in parasite-transmitting pregnant women and their congenitally infected newborns. Otherwise, experimental observations brought to light ADE of T. cruzi infection (involving Fc gamma R) in mouse pups displaying maternally transferred antibodies, out of an inflammatory context. Herein, based on such data, we discuss the previously unconsidered possibility of a role of ADE in the trans-placental parasite transmission, and/or the development of severe and mortal clinical forms of congenital/neonatal Chagas disease in newborns of T. cruzi-infected mothers.</p>"

CD is now found in areas receiving migrant populations where no vector-borne transmission occurs. Chagasic cardiomyopathy (CC) is the most serious complication of the chronic phase of CD and the major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with CD. Case presentation Bolivian woman at 38 weeks of gestation was admitted at the emergency room with the diagnosis of congestive heart failure. Cesarean section was performed and maternal hypotension and uterine atony occurred. Dilated myocardiopathy with severe left ventricle dysfunction was diagnosed. The patient referred positive serology for T. cruzi and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive so benznidazole therapy was started. She was discharged due to progressive improvement with cardiological treatment and implantable cardioverter defibrillator was placed 5 years later for the prevention of sudden cardiac death. Conclusions The diagnosis of CC in non-endemic areas requires a high index of suspicion and it is based on serology. Antiparasitic drugs are almost 100% effective in infected newborn babies and highly effective in the treatment of patients in the acute stage of the disease. However, the efficacy of both drugs decreases the longer a person has been infected. Treatment of CC that causes chronic heart failure is similar to that in non-Chagasic etiology."

In Spain, the main transmission route is congenital. We aimed to assess adherence to regional recommendations of universal screening for CD during pregnancy in Latin American women in the province of Alicante from 2014 to 2018. Methodology/Principal findings Retrospective quality study using two availa sources: 1) delivery records of Latin American women that gave birth in the 10 public hospitals of Alicante between January 2014 and December 2018; and 2) records of Chagas serologies carried out in those centers between May 2013 and December 2018. There were 3026 deliveries in Latin American women during the study period; 1178 (38.9%) underwent CD serology. Screening adherence ranged from 17.2% to 59.3% in the different health departments and was higher in Bolivian women (48.3%). Twenty-six deliveries (2.2%) had a positive screening; CD was confirmed in 23 (2%) deliveries of 21 women. Bolivians had the highest seroprevalence (21/112; 18.7%), followed by Colombians (1/333; 0.3%) and Ecuadorians (1/348; 0.3%). Of 21 CD-positive women (19 Bolivians, 1 Colombian, 1 Ecuadorian), infection was already known in 12 (57.1%), and 9 (42.9%) had already been treated. Only 1 of the 12 untreated women (8.3%) was treated postpartum. Follow-up started in 20 of the 23 (87.0%) neonates but was completed only in 11 (47.8%); no cases of congenital transmission were detected. Among the 1848 unscreened deliveries, we estimate 43 undiagnosed cases of CD and 1 to 2 undetected cases of congenital transmission. Conclusions/Significance Adherence to recommendations of systematic screening for CD in Latin American pregnant women in Alicante can be improved. Strategies to strengthen treatment of postpartum women and monitoring of exposed newborns are needed. Currently, there may be undetected cases of congenital transmission in our province. Author summary Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease endemic to Latin America. In absence of the triatomine vector in Spain, congenital (mother-to-infant) transmission is the main infection route. The Valencian Community has recommended universal screening for CD in pregnant Latin American women since 2007. In our study we analyzed adherence to that recommendation in Alicante province from 2014 to 2018, finding that it is quite low (38.9% overall, 48.3% in Bolivians) and heterogeneous between health departments. Among unscreened pregnant women during the study period, we estimate that there could be 43 undiagnosed cases of CD and 1 to 2 undetected infections in infants. We also observed very low adherence to treatment after delivery in CD-diagnosed, untreated women (8.3%), and a low rate of completed follow-up in newborns at risk of vertical infection (47.8%). We need to improve the program in order to achieve universal CD screening in Latin American (and especially Bolivian) pregnant women, to enhance CD treatment in postpartum women, and to improve monitoring in exposed newborns through a well-established notification and follow-up circuit."

Improvements in detection of this parasite, with tools that can be easily adapted to be used in remote rural areas, will make the early diagnosis of infected children possible, allowing a prompt trypanocidal treatment and avoiding the current loss of opportunities for the diagnosis of 100% of T. cruzi congenitally infected infants."

Herein, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of T. cruzi sequences of the mini-exon intergenic region obtained from a Large cohort of pregnant women and newborns from Argentina, Honduras, and Mexico, to assess parasite genetic diversity and possible associations with congenital transmission. Analysis of 105 samples (including five paired samples) from maternal and umbilical cord blood indicated that T. cruzi DTU distribution was similar among pregnant women and newborns from these three countries, with a high frequency of TcII-TcV-TcVI DTUs, including mixed infections with TcI. However, phylogenetic analysis revealed that although the same parasite haplotypes circulated in these three countries, they were present at different frequencies, leading to significant geographic differences. Of importance, a strong association was observed between parasite haplotypes and congenital infection of newborns. Thus, the identification of parasite haplotypes in pregnant women, but not of parasite DTUs, may help predict congenital transmission of T. cruzi."

Vertical transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi infection accounts for a growing proportion of new cases of Chagas disease. Better risk stratification is needed to predict which women are more likely to transmit the infection. Methods. This study enrolled women and their infants at the Percy Boland Women's Hospital in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Pregnant women were screened for Chagas disease by rapid test and received confirmatory serology. Infants of seropositive mothers underwent diagnostic testing with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results. Among 5828 enrolled women, 1271 (21.8%) screened positive for Chagas disease. Older maternal age, family history of Chagas disease, home conditions, lower educational level, and history of living in a rural area were significantly associated with higher adjusted odds of maternal infection. Of the 1325 infants of seropositive mothers, 65 infants (4.9%) were diagnosed with congenital Chagas disease. Protective factors against transmission included cesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]:.36-.99) and family history of Chagas disease (aOR:.58; 95% CI:.34-.99). Twins were significantly more likely to be congenitally infected than singleton births (OR: 3.32; 95% CI: 1.60-6.90). Among congenitally infected infants, 32.3% had low birth weight, and 30.8% required hospitalization after birth. Conclusions. Although improved access to screening and qPCR increased the number of infants diagnosed with congenital Chagas disease, many infants remain undiagnosed. A better understanding of risk factors and improved access to highly sensitive and specific diagnostic techniques for congenital Chagas disease may help improve regional initiatives to reduce disease burden."

To determine the current state of the implementation of Chagas screening in pregnancy and newborns at risk in the eight Andalusian provinces. Methods. An observational, cross-sectional and descriptive study was carried out through a survey reviewed and validated by experts from the Andalusian Group of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology. Eighteen pediatric infectious disease specialists from Andalusian referral hospitals (fourteen public and four private) participated. Results. The Chagas screening during pregnancy was known by seventeen specialists (94%), and systematically applied in seven hospitals (38.9%) by gynecologists or midwives. The protocol for following-up newborns at risk was known by sixteen specialists (88.9%) and applied in ten hospitals (55.5%), two of which did not study siblings and relatives of these newborns. Only two cases of vertical transmission of Chagas (11.1%) were detected; it happened in two hospitals applying systematically the Chagas screening to pregnant woman at risk, the same ones that also diagnosed two cases in siblings of newborns at risk. Conclusion. In Andalusia screening of Chagas disease in pregnant women and newborns at risk is not carried out in a systematic and uniform way in all the reference hospitals, so an underdiagnosis of congenital Chagas disease is highly probable. The training of professionals involved in assisting pregnant women and their offspring, and the unification of the follow-up criteria for newborns at risk would be essential for carrying out both a correct diagnosis and an early treatment of these cases."

One or several infecting strains of T. cruzi (with specific features) interact with: (i) the immune system of a pregnant woman whom responses depend on genetic and environmental factors, (ii) the placenta harboring its own defenses, and, finally, (iii) the fetal immune system displaying responses also susceptible to be modulated by maternal and environmental factors, as well as his own genetic background which is different from her mother. The severity of congenital Chagas disease depends on the magnitude of such final responses. The paper is mainly based on human data, but integrates also complementary observations obtained in experimental infections. It also focuses on important gaps in our knowledge of this congenital infection, such as the role of parasite diversity vs host genetic factors, as well as that of the maternal and placental microbiomes and the microbiome acquisition by infant in the control of infection.

The performance of the Elecsys Chagas assay was evaluated in comparison with those of other widely used T. cruzi antibody assays, at multiple sites (Europe/Latin America). Relative sensitivity and specificity were assessed by using samples from blood donors, pregnant women, and hospitalized patients from regions where Chagas disease is endemic and from regions of nonendemicity. The Elecsys Chagas assay had an overall relative sensitivity of 100% (n = 674). Overall relative specificities were 99.90% (n = 14,681), 100% (n = 313), and 100% (n = 517) for samples from blood donors, pregnant women, and hospitalized patients, respectively. The analytical specificity was 99.83% (n = 594). The Elecsys Chagas assay detected T. cruzi antibodies in two World Health Organization (WHO) standard T. cruzi reference panels (panels 09/188 and 09/186) at a 1: 512 dilution, corresponding to a cutoff sensitivity of approximately 1 mIU/ml. The Elecsys Chagas assay demonstrated robust performance under routine conditions at multiple sites in Europe and Latin America. In contrast to other available Chagas assays, the Elecsys assay uses a reduced number of recombinant T. cruzi antigens, resulting in a significantly smaller number of cross-reactions and improved analytical specificity while being highly sensitive."

The vertical transmission rate is around 5%. A routine prenatal screening with serology of all pregnant women from endemic areas is recommended to identify infected newborns, allowing early treatment and cure. Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of positive Chagas serology in a cohort of pregnant women from Latin-America and its vertical transmission. Patients and methods: An observational, prospective, follow-up study was conducted on women with positive serology to T. cruzi, as well as their newborns, from January 2013 to April 2015. Congenital Chagas was ruled out using a PCR technique at birth and at 1 month, and with serology at 9-12 months old. A child was considered infected when PCR was positive, and uninfected when PCR was negative, and/or it had a negative serology. Results: Screening was performed on 1244 pregnant women from Latin-America, and there were positive results in 40 (prevalence 3.2%, 95% CI: 2.4-4.4%), with 85% of them from Bolivia. There was only one infected newborn (rate of vertical transmission 2.8% (95% CI: 0-15%)), who had a positive PCR at birth. Relative studies enabled an 8-year-old sister with an asymptomatic disease to be diagnosed and treated. Both were treated successfully with benznidazole (later the PCR and serology were negative). Conclusion: Screening during pregnancy in Latin-American women helped to detect those with Chagas disease. The rate of vertical transmission was 2.8%, in keeping with literature.

Once confined to endemic areas of Latin America, CD has more recently become a global disease as a result of migration flows from endemic to non-endemic regions, particularly in northern America and Europe. Congenital transmission is a particular challenge as it may be sustained for multiple generations and perpetuate the infection even in non-endemic countries.Methods: Subjects were identified during a cross-sectional survey of CD among Latin American people living in Milan, Italy. Serology was carried out using tests based on either a lysate and a recombinant antigen of Trypanosoma cruzi. They were also tested by a conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) targeting the 330 bp variable region of the T. cruzi kinetoplast minicircle genome and a commercial real-time PCR.Results: We here describe a Bolivian family cluster with seven affected people with at least two autochthonous congenital T. cruzi infection which was identified during the course of a CD screening programme. We also review the epidemiology, diagnosis and control of congenital CD, with particular emphasis on the challenges facing the control and management of such a complex and still largely hidden disease. Conclusions: Our experience confirms the need to screen for CD all family members once a case is diagnosed and shows the possible high rate of congenital CD also in non-endemic areas."

Congenital Trypanosoma cruzi transmission is now estimated to account for 22% of new infections, representing a significant public health problem across Latin America and internationally. Treatment during infancy is highly efficacious and well tolerated, but current assays for early detection fail to detect >50% of infected neonates, and 9-month follow-up is low. Methods. Women who presented for delivery at 2 urban hospitals in Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia, were screened by rapid test. Specimens from infants of infected women were tested by microscopy (micromethod), quantitative PCR (qPCR), and immunoglobulin (Ig)M trypomastigote excreted-secreted antigen (TESA)-blots at birth and 1 month and by IgG serology at 6 and 9 months. Results. Among 487 infants of 476 seropositive women, congenital T. cruzi infection was detected in 38 infants of 35 mothers (7.8%). In cord blood, qPCR, TESA-blot, and micromethod sensitivities/specificities were 68.6%/99.1%, 58.3%/99.1%, and 16.7%/100%, respectively. When birth and 1-month results were combined, cumulative sensitivities reached 84.2%, 73.7%, and 34.2%, respectively. Low birthweight and/or respiratory distress were reported in 11 (29%) infected infants. Infants with clinical signs had higher parasite loads and were significantly more likely to be detected by micromethod. Conclusions. The proportion of T. cruzi-infected infants with clinical signs has fallen since the 1990s, but symptomatic congenital Chagas disease still represents a significant, albeit challenging to detect, public health problem. Molecular methods could facilitate earlier diagnosis and circumvent loss to follow-up but remain logistically and economically prohibitive for routine screening in resource-limited settings."

Congenital transmission of CD is an increasingly relevant public health problem. It progressively becomes the main transmission route over others and can occur in both endemic and non-endemic countries. Though most congenitally infected newborns are asymptomatic at birth, they display higher frequencies of prematurity, low birth weight, and lower Apgar scores compared to uninfected ones, and some suffer from severe symptoms. If not diagnosed and treated, infected newborns are at risk of developing disabling and life-threatening chronic pathologies later in life. The success or failure of congenital transmission depends on interactions between the parasite, the placenta, the mother, and the fetus. We review and discuss here the current knowledge about these parameters, including parasite virulence factors such as exovesicles, placental tropism, potential placental defense mechanisms, the placental transcriptome of infected women, gene polymorphism, and the maternal and fetal/neonatal immune responses, that might modulate the risk of T. cruzi congenital transmission."

We evaluated an intervention strategy aimed to detect congenital Chagas disease cases at a major hospital in the Ecuadorian Amazon via cord blood analysis at the time of delivery. All women giving birth at the hospital during the study period (191) were invited to participate. Among them, two (1.0%) did not adjust to the inclusion criteria and four (2.1%) declined to participate in the study, showing the intervention had good acceptability among the mothers. It was possible to obtain cord blood samples during 146 of the deliveries, and only one woman was found to be seropositive, without evidence of transmission to the newborn at delivery or 8 months later. In addition, sociodemographic and economic characterization of the study population revealed that few women had previous knowledge about Chagas disease (16.1%) whereas more than half (62.5%) recognized the vector. Recognizing the vector and having seen it indoors were associated with women from rural families, involved in agriculture, and hunting in the forest. Interestingly, most women (87.3%) reported having easy access to Ecuador's national health system, suggesting serological screening during prenatal visits would be of value in this province. With a proper prenatal screening system in place, cord blood screening would allow for timely detection of T. cruzi infection in newborns from both seropositive women and the minority (2.1%) of women who do not comply with prenatal care visits."

While neglect is a pervasive characteristic of Chagas disease in general, it tends to be especially overlooked in Central America, with more studies and resources devoted to the disease in South America. Here we report on the current epidemiological scenario of Chagas disease in Central America with the objective of presenting a panorama that includes national program details, recent morbidity data, new findings, and events relevant to the disease.Recent FindingsMultinational initiatives and collaborations with external stakeholders that began around the beginning of this century led to the successful elimination of the vector species Rhodnius prolixus, which was last found in Guatemala in 2015. However, acute Chagas disease cases continue to be found in all countries with a surveillance system in place, mainly attributed to Trypanosoma cruzi transmission to humans by the native triatomine species Triatoma dimidiata and Rhodnius pallescens. Serological surveys targeting children have generally found varied T. cruzi infection prevalence, studies of transplacentally transmitted T. cruzi infection in the academic/public sectors have found a few cases in the region, and a new T. cruzi transmission focus was found in western Panama.SummaryChagas disease transmission and prevalence have been reduced in Central America over the past two decades, but there is still much progress to be made toward interruption of T. cruzi transmission to humans by native vector species. Other key areas for improvement are implementing screening for T. cruzi infection in pregnant women, improving reliability of diagnostic tests, expanding access to etiological treatment, and increasing availability and quality of data."

However, no systematic reviews of risk factors for T. cruzi vertical transmission have been performed. Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature in PubMed, LILACS, and Embase databases, following PRISMA guidelines. Studies were not excluded based on language, country of origin, or publication date. Results: Our literature review yielded 27 relevant studies examining a wide variety of risk factors, including maternal age, parasitic load, immunologic factors and vector exposure. Several studies suggested that mothers with higher parasitic loads may have a greater risk of vertical transmission. A meta-analysis of 2 studies found a significantly higher parasitic load among transmitting than nontransmitting mothers with T. cruzi infection. A second meta-analysis of 10 studies demonstrated that maternal age was not significantly associated with vertical transmission risk. Conclusions: The literature suggests that high maternal parasitic load may be a risk factor for congenital Chagas disease among infants of T. cruzi seropositive mothers. Given the considerable heterogeneity and risk of bias among current literature, additional studies are warranted to assess potential risk factors for vertical transmission of T. cruzi infection. ? 2021 The Author(s).

Mother-to-child transmission is the main source of new cases of Chagas disease and of its occurrence in non-endemic areas. Our objective was to survey the information available on congenital T. cruzi infection, to analyze its evolution and its relation with the index of maternal infection and the risk for vector-borne infection by province of Argentina. Data concerning the public health sector for the period 1997-2014 were retrieved from national and local records. An increase in the number and proportion of pregnant women examined for Chagas was observed, reaching 60.3% coverage in 2014. The prevalence of maternal infection dropped from 9.0% to 2.6%. The control of newborns from infected women was highly variable (23.3%-93.6%), and data quality was deficient, varying amply by province and year. The rate of congenital infection had an irregular evolution and its national average fluctuated between 1.9 and 8.2%. An association was observed between the risk for vector-borne infection and the prevalence of maternal infection by province (Wilcoxon test p = 0.017). The rate of congenital transmission by province was neither associated with the rate of maternal infection (linear regression p = 0.686) nor with the risk for vectorial infection (Kruskal-Wallis test p = 0.3154). The available data show insufficient control of children born from infected mothers, as well as deficient recording of these procedures. Both aspects must be improved to achieve better epidemiological information and to enable timely access of infected children to treatment."

Some European health authorities have implemented screening programs to prevent vertical transmission, but the lack of a uniform protocol calls for the urgent establishment of a new strategy common to all laboratories. Our aims were to (i) analyze the trend of passive IgG antibodies in the newborn by means of five serological tests for the diagnosis and follow-up of congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection, (ii) assess the utility of these techniques for diagnosing a congenital transmission, and (iii) propose a strategy for a prompt, efficient, and cost-effective diagnosis of T. cruzi infection. In noninfected newborns, a continuous decreasing trend of passive IgG antibodies was observed, but none of the serological assays seroreverted in any the infants before 12 months. From 12 months onwards, serological tests achieved negative results in all the samples analyzed, with the exception of the highly sensitive chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). In contrast, in congenitally infected infants, the antibody decline was detected only after treatment initiation. In order to improve the diagnosis of congenital T. cruzi infection, we propose a new strategy involving fewer tests that allows significant cost savings. The protocol could start 1 month after birth with a parasitological test and/or a PCR. If negative, a serological test would be carried out at 9 months, which if positive, would be followed by another at around 12 months for confirmation."

We performed an observational prospective study in 2011-2014 enrolling women at delivery in one hospital in Argentina, two hospitals in Honduras, and two hospitals in Mexico.

This, because the congenital transmission continues the main active transmission mechanisms of T. cruzi and a major public health problem for the country. Aim: To present the epidemiological information generated after the implementation of the ECH screening in the SSFCC HFBC, two years after its operation began. Methods: Screening test: inmunequimioluminiscence (IQLU), certification by IFI, ELISA and/or western blot. Follow up of newborn infants with PCR, IFI, ELISA and IQLU. Results: Between April 2016 and july 2018, 14.012 subject's samples were examined of which 62 resulted reactive (0.53% seropositivity) in the total studied population where 28 patients resulted positive for CHD, which corresponds to a 0.2% prevalence. Of the total population, 11.780 were pregnant. women, of these 41 were reactive and 10 were confirmed with CHD thus showing a prevalence of 0.085%. The other 18 positive cases of non-pregnant patients corresponded a prevalence of 0.81%. Also, 10 newborn and infant children of mothers with CHD were followed up. In all, congenital transmission (0%) was ruled out. Nifurtimox treatment of the mothers were completed in 30% of them. It is concluded that the implementation of the program in the HDFBC fulfills the objectives of screening, detection and diagnosis of CHD, so as the timely follow-up and phannacologic treatment of the newborn. The 0.085% prevalence of CHD in pregnant women as the 0.20% in total population are significantly lower (p-valor < 0.01) than the 0.7% reported in 2016 for the Metropolitan Region (MR), a fact that we suggest is a consequence of the national program implementation. Likewise, the 0% transpLacental transmission is accorded to the rate of 0.91 x 10.000 live births reported in 2017 for the MR. Based on the learning acquired during the development of the research, recommendations are given to contribute to the operation of the program."

During transplacental transmission, the parasite must cross the placental barrier where the trophoblast, a continuous renewing epithelium, is the first tissue to have contact with the parasite. Importantly, the epithelial turnover is considered part of the innate immune system since pathogens, prior to cell invasion, must attach to the surface of cells. The trophoblast turnover involves cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptotic cell death, all of them are induced by the parasite.

The loss of this balance is crucial for the progression of the sickness. The virulence and tropism of the T. cruzi infecting strain together to the inflammation processes in the cardiac tissue are the main factors for the establishment and severity of the cardiomyopathy. The efficacy of treatment in chronic Chagas disease patients is controversial. However, several studies carried out in chronic patients demonstrated that antiparasitic treatment reduces parasite load in the bloodstream and leads to an improvement in the immune response against the Trypanosome cruzi parasite. The present review is mainly focused on the cellular patterns associated to the clinical status and the evolution of the disease in chronic patients, as well as the effectiveness of the treatment related to T. cruzi infection control.

A cost-utility analysis was carried out to compare the four strategies from two perspectives, the societal and the Spanish National Health System (SNHS). A decision tree representing the clinical evolution of Chagas disease throughout patient's life was built. The strategies were compared through the incremental cost-utility ratio, using euros as cost measurement and quality-adjusted life years as utility measurement. A sensitivity analysis was performed to test the model parameters and their influence on the results. We found the ""Non-screening"" as the most expensive and less effective of the evaluated strategies, from both the societal and the SNHS perspectives. Among the screening evaluated strategies the most efficient was, from both perspectives, to extent the antenatal screening of the Latin American pregnant women and their newborns up to the relatives of the positive women. Several parameters influenced significantly on the sensitivity analyses, particularly the chronic treatment efficacy or the prevalence of Chagas disease. In conclusion, for the general Latin American immigrants living in Spain the most efficient would be to screen the Latin American mothers, their newborns and the close relatives of the mothers with a positive serology. However for higher prevalence immigrant population the most efficient intervention would be to extend the program to the close relatives of the negative mothers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Conversely, infants who did not develop congenital T. cruzi infection had higher levels of IFN-gamma than infected infants born to uninfected mothers. Monokine induced by IFN-gamma, MCP-1, and IFN-gamma production induced in T. cruzi-infected infants correlated with parasitemia, whereas the plasma levels of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-6 were less parasite load dependent.

The Canadian Blood Services and Hema-Quebec have both implemented selective screening of blood donors for CD based on risk factors. In 2011, Hema-Quebec identified two seropositive 'at-risk' Chilean siblings who had donated blood in Montreal, Quebec. They were referred to the JD MacLean Centre for Tropical Diseases (Montreal, Quebec) for confirmatory testing (T cruzi excreted-secreted antigen ELISA, polymerase chain reaction and/or radioimmunoprecipitation assay) and follow-up. Screening of the rest of the family revealed two other seropositive family members (the mother and sister). While their geographical history in Chile suggests vectorial transmission, this family cluster of CD raises the possibility of vertical transmission. Congenital infection should always be considered among CD-positive mothers and pregnant women.

Congenital transmission is now considered an important route of CD spread in non-endemic countries where no routine testing of pregnant women for the disease is implemented. The main cellular mechanisms that lead to fetal infection by T. cruzi, despite the presence of a placental barrier, remain unclear. Mother-to-child transmission most likely occurs when bloodstream trypomastigotes reach the placental intervillous space and interact with the large cellular surface provided by the syncytioptrophoblasts. These highly specialized cells not only function as a physical obstacle between mother and fetus, but also modulate immune responses against pathogen infections. To overcome the limitations associated with the use of human fetal tissues, we employed a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture model to recreate the human placenta environment. In this system, the trophoblast-derived JEG-3 cell line is co-cultured with human brain microvascular endothelial cells attached to microcarrier beads in a rotating bioreactor. Here, we report that 3D culture of JEG-3/HBMEC spheroids promote JEG-3 cells differentiation revealed by the formation of syncytia and production of beta human chorionic gonadotropin and human placental lactogen (hPL). Under these growth conditions, we demonstrate that 3D-grown JEG-3 cells have reduced susceptibility to T. cruzi infection compared to JEG-3 cells grown in conventional tissue culture flasks. We also show that 3D-cultured JEG-3 cells release paracrine factors in the supernatant that prevent T. cruzi infection of non-trophoblastic cell lines. Our in vitro model of T. cruzi vertical transmission may help better understand the molecular processes by which parasites bypass the human placental barrier and could be exploited to evaluate therapeutics to reduce congenital CD."

Seventy-five peripheral blood samples were analyzed by two real-time PCR methods (qPCR) based on satellite DNA (SatDNA) and kinetoplastid DNA (kDNA). The 20 samples testing positive in both methods, all belonging to Bolivian individuals, were submitted to DTU characterization using two PCR-based flowcharts: multiplex qPCR using TaqMan probes (MTq-PCR), and conventional PCR. These samples were also studied by sequencing the SatDNA and classified as type I (TcI/III), type II (TclI/IV) and type I/II hybrid (TcV/VI). Ten out of the 20 samples gave positive results in the flowcharts: TcV (5 samples), TcII/V/VI (3) and mixed infections by TcV plus TclI (1) and TcV plus Tcll/VI (1). By SatDNA sequencing, we classified the 20 samples, 19 as type I/II and one as type I.

Methods A descriptive, retrospective study including Chagas seropositive pregnant women who were attended at three tertiary hospitals in Madrid, from January 2012 to September 2016. Infants were examined by PCR at birth and 1 month later and serologically studied at 9 months or later. Children were considered infected when the parasite was detected by PCR at any age or when serology remained positive without decline over the age of 9 months. Results We included 122 seropositive-infected pregnant women, 81% were from Bolivia and only 8.2% had been treated before. 125 newborns were studied and finally 109 were included (12.8% lost the follow-up before performing the last serology). The VT rate was 2.75% (95% CI: 0,57-8,8%). Infected infants had positive PCR at birth and 1 month later. All of them were treated successfully with benznidazole (PCR and serology became negative later on). All non-infected children presented negative PCR. The mean age at which uninfected patients had negative serology was 10.5 months. Conclusions The VT rate is in keeping with literature and confirms the need to carry out a screening in pregnant women coming from endemic areas. PCR seems to be a useful tool to provide early diagnosis of congenital"

Human infection is mainly spread by Triatominae insects. Other forms of transmission are congenital, blood transfusion and organ transplantation. Methods: Anti-T. cruzi antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot (WB) in 155 serum samples from mothers and their babies. Indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) and a commercial test were used to validate efficacy of a specific ELISA-iron-excreted superoxide dismutase assay. Sera from babies were collected at 6 and 12 months, whereas maternal samples were obtained after delivery. Calostrum and umbilical cord samples were simultaneously obtained. Results: Anti-T. cruzi antibodies were detected in 8 (5.16%) mothers by ELISA-WB, in 7 (4.51%) using IFA and in 1 (0.64%) by a commercial kit. Nine (5.80%) 6-month-old children were positive by ELISA-WB and 7 (4.51%) by IFA; negative results were obtained when the commercial kit was used. At 12 month of age, 15 (9.67%) children were positive by ELISA-WB, 13 (8.38%) by IFA and 1 (0.64%) by the commercial test. Antibodies were detected in 4 mothers whose children were serologically negative. Four other mothers and their children were positive, but only one of them had detected antibodies in umbilical cord up to 12 months, thus assuming vertical transmission. Conclusions: The use of iron-excreted superoxide dismutase as antigen in serologic tests for detection of T. cruzi yielded promising results as diagnostic procedure."

It is currently unclear why only a proportion of children born to Trypanosoma cruzi-infected mothers acquire the infection. We have examined the association of 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in genes coding for placental expression enzymes as genetic markers of susceptibility to congenital T. Cruzi infection (hereafter, ""congenital infection""): rs2014683 and rs1048988 in ALPP; rs11244787 and rs1871054 in ADAM12; rs243866, rs243865, rs17859821, rs243864, and rs2285053 in MMP2; and rs3918242 and rs2234681 in MMP9. Methods. Two groups of children born to mothers seropositive for T. Cruzi were compared: 101 had congenital infection, and 116 were uninfected. Novel high-resolution melting and capillary electrophoresis genotyping techniques were designed and used. Results. Logistic regression analysis showed that mutations in rs11244787 and rs1871054 (in ADAM12) and rs243866, rs17859821, and rs2285053 (in MMP2) were associated with susceptibility to congenital infection. Multifactor dimensionality reduction revealed that genotyping results for rs11244787, rs1871054, rs243866, rs17859821 and rs243864 sites would be a good predictor of congenital infection. Conclusions. Our results suggest an important role of human polymorphisms in proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and the immune response during congenital infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the association between mutations in placentally expressed genes and susceptibility to congenital infection. © 2015 The Author 2015.

Aim: Our objective was to evaluate the appropriateness of screening for Trypanosoma cruzi infection in Latin American migrants and their descendants. Methods: We reviewed the literature using rigorous criteria. The quality of evidence was ranked according to the GRADE classification. An evidence to decision framework was adopted to provide information on the most relevant aspects necessary to formulate recommendations. Results: The 33 studies evaluated revealed a prevalence of T. cruzi infection among Latin American migrants in Europe of 6.08% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.24-9.69; 28 studies). Vertical transmission occurred in three of 100 live births (95% CI: 1-6; 13 studies). The prevalence of cardiovascular disease was 19% (95% CI: 13-27; nine studies), including only 1% severe cardiac events (95% CI: 0-2; 11 studies). The overall quality of evidence was low because of risk of bias in the studies and considerable heterogeneity of the evaluated populations. The recommendations took into account economic studies on the value of screening strategies and studies on acceptability of screening and knowledge of the disease in the affected population.

Presentation in non-endemic areas is either in the asymptomatic indeterminate phase or the chronic phase with cardiac and/or gastrointestinal complications. Methods: The Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD) based in central London, provides tertiary care for the management of CD. We reviewed all cases managed at this centre between 1995 and 2018. Results: Sixty patients with serologically proven CD were identified. Most were female (70%), with a median age at diagnosis of 41 years. Three quarters of the patients were originally from Bolivia. 62% of all patients were referred to the HTD by their GP. Nearly half of the patients were asymptomatic (47%). Twelve patients had signs of cardiac involvement secondary to CD. Evidence of gastrointestinal damage was established in three patients. Treatment was provided at HTD for 31 patients (47%). Most patients (29) received benznidazole, five of them did not tolerate the course and were switched to nifurtimox. Of the seven patients receiving this second line drug, five completed treatment, whilst two interrupted it due to side effects. Conclusions: Despite the UK health system having all the resources required to diagnose, treat and follow up cases, there is lack of awareness of CD, such that the vast majority of cases remain undiagnosed and therefore do not receive treatment. We propose key interventions to improve the detection and management of this condition in the UK, especially in pregnant women and neonates."

It is transmitted mainly by triatominae (""kissing bugs""). Mazzoti reported the first two human cases in Mexico. The form of transmission is by parasites entering the organism in feces of the insect, by blood transfusion, from mother to child, by organ transplant and laboratory accidents. In Mexico, 1.1 million people are estimated to be infected; the incidence in 2012 was 0.70 per 1,00,000 population. In 2017, the highest incidence rates were registered in Yucatan, Oaxaca and Hidalgo. The infection causes cardiomyopathies and mega-organs of the digestive tract. Diagnosis in the acute phase is by parasitological approach and, in the chronic phase, by laboratory screening studies. In Mexico's blood banks, screening for Chagas disease is mandatory; from 2007 to 2016, seroprevalence has decreased from 0.40 to 0.32 due to the improvement of donor selection processes and the ad hoc questionnaire. The targets of the parasite are neurons and smooth and myocardial muscle cells. The association of neuronal and smooth muscle destruction defines the presentation of chagas mega-syndromes. Initial manifestations of the disease can go unnoticed; 5% show apparent signs and symptoms and 30% will progress to the chronic asymptomatic phase. Currently available treatments have effect in the acute phase. For the control of Chagas disease, the Specific Action Program for the Prevention and Control of Chagas Disease (PAE Chagas 2013-2018) is available to initiate activities aimed at eliminating transfusion and congenital transmission and controlling vector transmission. The success of medical care depends on oportune detection, early etiological treatment and coverage broadening.

A total of 320 studies were screened and 23 studies were included. We found evidence that the prevalence of Chagas disease is higher than expected in some migrant groups and that reliance on blood donor screening prevalence estimates underestimates the burden of disease. Overall there is a dearth of high quality epidemiologic studies on the prevalence of Chagas disease in migrants, especially among intra-regional migrants within Latin America. Given that this zoonotic disease cannot likely be eradicated, improved surveillance and reporting is vital to continuing control efforts. More accurate health surveillance of both Latin American migrants and the Chagas disease burden will help countries appropriately scale up their response to this chronic disease. Overall, improved estimates of Chagas disease among migrants would likely serve to highlight the real need for better screening, diagnostics, and treatment of individuals living with the disease.

The relatively recent migratory flux includes Germany, France, the United States, Australia, Japan, and some Latin American countries. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to describe the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women, analyzing the Bolivian-specific Chagas prevalence as the main contributor of migratory populations from Chagas disease-endemic areas to Buenos Aires city, Argentina, and to evaluate the impact of these migrant influxes on the process of the ""urbanization"" of the disease in reference hospital Jose Maria Ramos Mejia (JMRM). Methodology: Overall, 21,332 pregnant women (100%) between 15 and 49 years of age derived from the public maternity service of JMRMH were studied. Serology data was obtained from registered serological diagnosis data, consisting of three different serological tests performed at the Public Parasitology Unit. Results: Although general prevalence decreased during the analyzed period, the specific prevalence of pregnant women from Bolivian origin showed a sustained growth during 1983-2013. Solely 5% of the total pregnant women population from Bolivia contributed to one third of the total Chagas prevalence. Conclusions: This study showed that a cohort of pregnant women from Bolivia who attended JMRMH during the period 1983-2007 constituted a population at risk for congenital transmission. Increased migration from endemic areas of Bolivia might potentially increase the prevalence of Chagas disease among pregnant women.

Pregnancy is the optimal access point for identifying Chagas disease in at-risk mothers and their infants. In this review, we update progress toward implementation of pregnancy-based screening for congenital Chagas disease in nonendemic settings. Recent findings International organizations have updated recommendations for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of congenital Chagas disease. Reports of successful implementation of pregnancy-based screening at some centers provide a model for optimizing diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease. Screening family members of index patients may identify additional T. cruzi-infected persons. Promising tests to augment current diagnostic modalities for maternal and congenital Chagas disease are in development. Universal or risk-based screening would be cost-effective. More healthcare providers are now aware that treatment of congenital Chagas disease is curative and are promoting efforts to make pregnancy-based screening for congenital Chagas disease a standard of care. Ongoing efforts to implement routine pregnancy-based screening for congenital Chagas disease in nonendemic regions will mutually benefit infants, their mothers and family members and can prevent potentially fatal Chagas cardiomyopathy."

Wild mammals constitute natural reservoirs of this parasite, which is transmitted by hematophagous kissing bugs of the family Reduviidae. T. cruzi is genetically subdivided into six discrete typing units (DTUs), T. cruzi (Tc)I to TcVI. In Brazil, especially in the state of Parana, TcI and TcII are widely distributed. However, TcII is less frequently found in wild reservoirs and triatomine, and more frequently found in patients. The goal of this study was to investigate the natural occurrence of T. cruzi in wild synanthropic mammals captured in urban forest fragments of the Atlantic Forest of Parana, southern Brazil. In this way, 12 opossums and 35 bats belonging to five species were captured in urban forest parks of the city of Maringa, Parana, an area considered endemic for Chagas disease. PCR-kinetoplast DNA molecular diagnostic reveals Trypanosoma sp. infection in 12 (100%) Didelphis albiventris and 10 (40%) Artibeus lituratus. In addition to demonstrating the presence of Trypanosoma in the two groups of mammals studied, we obtained an isolate of the parasite genotyped as TcII by amplification of the cytochrome oxidase II gene by PCR, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism with AluI, and confirmed by PCR of rDNA 24S alpha.

Methods: For species and genotype identification, the stocks were analyzed by parasitological techniques, polymerase chain reaction assays targeted to specific DNA sequences, isoenzyme patterns, besides sequencing of a polymorphic locus of TcSC5D gene (one stock). Results: The isolates presented typical T. cruzi morphology and usually grew well in routine culture media. Metacyclic trypomastigotes were found in cultures or experimentally infected Triatoma infestans. All isolates were pure T. cruzi cultures, presenting typical 330-bp products from kinetoplast DNA minicircles, and 250 or 200-bp amplicons from the mini-exon non-transcribed spacer. Their genetic type assignment was resolved by their isoenzyme profiles. The finding of TcI in one asymptomatic patient from Paraíba was confirmed by the sequencing assay.

Though natural transmission by insect vectors has been controlled, there is significant risk of T. cruzi transmission by blood transfusion in non-endemic regions, generally due to immigration processes from endemic areas. Methodology: The objective of this study was to evaluate anti-T. cruzi seroprevalence in blood donors from the western part of São Paulo State, Brazil, by serologic and immunofluorescence confirmation tests for the period between 2012 and 2014. Currently, this region is regarded as a non-endemic area for Chagas disease. Results: The confirmed overall T. cruzi seroprevalence among blood donors was 0.10%, which can be considered low compared to other Brazilian regions. Nevertheless, the distribution of the anti-T. cruzi antibodies within the examined region was uneven, and some areas of significantly higher prevalence were observed. Conclusions: We could consider two tendencies in the prevalence of T. cruzi: (i) residual older undiagnosed cases from São Paulo State, and (ii) immigration from endemic Brazilian or South American regions. The discordance obtained for T. cruzi prevalence by serologic and immunofluorescence methods demonstrates that more specific routine diagnosis is needed to diminish the cost of the assays and the loss of blood supply once all seropositive blood bags are immediately discarded. © 2017 Slavov et al."

We included all deaths recorded in Brazil from 2000 to 2019 in which Chagas disease and HIV/AIDS were mentioned on the same death certificate, either as underlying or as associated causes of death. Results Chagas disease and HIV/AIDS were mentioned on 196/22 663 092 death certificates. HIV/AIDS was the underlying cause in 58.2% (114/196) of deaths and Chagas disease in 33.2% (65/196).

Additionally, ELISA on lysates of trypomastigotes of both strains Tulahuen and Brazil revealed elevated levels of RvD1 compared with lysates of cultured epimastigotes of T. cruzi, tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii, trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma brucei, cultured L6E9 myoblasts, and culture medium containing no cells. Lysates of T. cruzi-infected myoblasts also displayed increased levels of RvD1. Lipid mediator metabolomics confirmed that the trypomastigotes of T. cruzi produced RvD1, RvD5, and RvE2, which have been demonstrated to modulate the host response to bacterial infections. Plasma RvD1 levels may be both host and parasite derived. Since T. cruzi synthesizes specialized proresolving mediators of inflammation, as well as proinflammatory eicosanoids, such as thromboxane A(2), one may speculate that by using these lipid mediators to modulate its microenvironment, the parasite is able to survive."

Triatoma brasiliensis is the main vector of the parasite in Brazil, and dogs are an important reservoir of the parasite. The aim of this study was to evaluate the insecticidal effect of fluralaner (Bravecto (R)) on T. brasiliensis after a blood meal in treated dogs. Methods: Healthy mongrel dogs (n = 8) were recruited from the Zoonoses Control Center (ZCC) in the city of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, and randomized into two groups, a fluralaner (Bravecto (R))-treated group (n = 4) and a control group (n = 4). Colony-reared third-, fourth- and fifth-instar nymphs of T. brasiliensis nymphs (n = 10) were allowed to feed on dogs from both groups for 30-40 min, once monthly, for up to 12 months. Bug mortality was observed up to 5 days after each blood meal. Results: Mortality in triatomines which had a blood meal on fluralaner (Bravecto (R))-treated dogs was 100% for up to 7 months after treatment, with mortality decreasing to 66.4% after 8 months, 57% after 9 months, 35% after 10 months, 10% after 11 months and 0% after 12 months. The mortality of triatomines that fed on non-treated control dogs was always <= 2.5%. Conclusions: Our results suggest that fluralaner (Bravecto (R)) treatment of dogs induces long-term mortality of T. brasiliensis after the blood meal.

Of those, 37 bats were found to be positive for trypanosomes by microhematocrit, (infection rate 8.3%) and 27 were positive after hemoculture analysis.

PCRs (18S rDNA, 24S alpha rDNA) showed compatible bands for TcI, whereas COII RFLP-PCR showed a similar pattern associated to TcII. However, there was no DNA amplification using spliced leader as a target, revealing a discrepancy between the results. Phylogenetic analysis of Cathepsin L-like and 18S rDNA sequences proved that 15 of the isolates corresponded to Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei and one to Trypanosoma dionisii.

Up to 2004, the occurrence of ACD by oral transmission, associated with food consumption, was rare. Recent cases of ACD in Brazil have been attributed to the consumption of juice from the acai palm containing reservoir animals or insect vectors waste, infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. This study aimed to determine the T. cruzi contamination rate and to genotype the parasite in food samples prepared from acai, which are commercialized in Rio de Janeiro and the Para States in Brazil. Methods: The amplificability of DNA extracted from acai samples, and T. cruzi and Triatominae detection were performed by conventional PCR. Molecular characterization was done by multilocus PCR analysis, to determine the parasite discrete type units (DTUs) based on the size of PCR products in agarose gels, using the intergenic region of the spliced leader (SL), 24 Sa rDNA and nuclear fragment A10 as targets. Results: From the 140 samples of acai-based products analyzed, T. cruzi DNA was detected in 14 samples (10%); triatomine DNA was detected in one of these 14 samples. The parasite genotyping demonstrated that food samples containing acai showed a mixture of T. cruzi DTUs with TcIII, TcV and TcI prevailing. Conclusions: In this study, the molecular detection and identification of T. cruzi from acai-based manufactured food samples, was performed for the first time. Although parasite DNA is a marker of possible contamination during food manufacturing, our findings do not indicate that acai is a source of Chagas disease via oral transmission per se, as live parasites were not investigated. Nevertheless, a molecular approach could be a powerful tool in the epidemiological investigation of outbreaks, supporting previous evidence that acai-based food can be contaminated with T. cruzi. Furthermore, both food quality control and assessment of good manufacturing practices involving acai-based products can be improved, assuring the safety of acai products."

Objectives: To describe a congenital Chagas Disease case and to report about the usefulness of prenatal screening for Chagas Disease. Clinical Case: A 29-week preterm newborn of a multiparous mother with Chagas Disease detected in the perinatal screening of current pregnancy. Due to history of Trypanosoma cruzi, PCR was performed on the 4th day of life resulting undetectable. At the 6th and the 8th week of life, a macular erythematous rash and fever and respiratory distress were observed, respectively, both self-limited. At the 8th week of life, as a routine prematurity follow-up, a fundus examination was performed which showed bilateral retinal granulation, therefore, a TORCH study was performed with a negative result. Also, in this same week, a second Trypanosoma cruzi PCR was performed, with a positive result. Lab tests reported visualization of trypomastigotes, confirming the Congenital Chagas Disease diagnosis. The patient was treated with Nifurtimox, presenting an adverse reaction at 35 days of treatment with neutropenia, vomiting, and poor weight gain. The treating drug was replaced by Benznidazole, achieving 60 days of treatment. At 22 months of chronologic age, the patient has remained asymptomatic.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in organ donor candidates. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on data from potential organ donors at the Center of Transplantation of the State of Ceara from 2010 - 2015. Results: Data from a total of 2,822 potential donors were obtained, of which 1,038 were effective donors and 1,784 were excluded, likely due to lack of family authorization or medical contraindication. The prevalence of T. cruzi infection among these potential donors was 1.3% (n = 29). The majority of infected donors were males aged 41 - 60 years, residing in the interior of the state. Interestingly, 72.4% (n = 21) had positive or inconclusive serology for additional infections, such as cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B and C, and toxoplasmosis. Probability analysis revealed that stroke was the most common cause of death among potential donors with CD. Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of CD and other coinfections among potential solid organ donors in Ceara, and statistical tests have shown that these individuals are at increased risk of stroke when compared to potential non-reactive donors. This work highlights the importance of screening DC infection in potential donors."

During congenital transmission, T cruzi must cross the placental barrier, composed of epithelial and connective tissues, in order to infect the developing fetus. Here we aimed to study the global changes of transcriptome in the placental tissue after a T. cruzi challenge.

Although transmission by triatomine insects has been controlled, other means of transmission maintain the infection. These forms of transmission are responsible for introducing Chagas disease in other non-endemic countries of the world. Thus, Chagas disease, nowadays is a worldwide health problem. In Brazil, acai pulp and sugarcane juice have been associated with Chagas disease outbreaks. The difficulties in isolation of the parasite from foods are hampering source tracking which could allow the confirmation of an implicated food commodity in these outbreak investigations. To address this scientific gap, we evaluated the performance of real-time PCR (qPCR) for detecting T. cruzi in acai pulp and sugarcane juice. All experiments were performed with acai pulp and sugarcane juice samples contaminated with different concentrations of T. cruzi. In assays with qPCR, the results showed that the ideal procedure for T. cruzi identification in acai pulp and sugarcane juice consisted of: i. centrifugation; ii. DNA extraction with a commercial kit for stool matrix; and iii. qPCR using a specific molecular marker for T. cruzi. The seeding in LIT medium of experimentally contaminated foods was effective in detecting the parasitic load by qPCR. The efficacy of qPCR was also verified testing food samples crushed with infected Triatomines. In conclusion, this methodology can be used to perform rapid diagnosis in outbreaks, facilitating measures in disease control."

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed to analyze the epidemiological profile of individuals with suspected cases of ACD in the municipality of Breves, located in the state of Path, Brazil. Therefore, notifications of suspected cases of ACD were collected from the Municipal Health Department of Breves from January 2007 to December 2017. Results: A total of 265 individuals were registered, and the majority were male (54.7%; 145/265). Age ranged from nine months to 79 years, with a greater number of notifications for individuals aged between 1 and 39 years (71.3%; 189/265).

Triatomine domiciliation is one of the main factors increasing the occurrence risk of this disease in humans. There are 66 triatomine species in Brazil, with three genera of significant epidemiological importance-Panstrongylus, Rhodnius, and Triatoma. Among the Triatoma species, Triatoma williami, a wild species, has been reported in Goias, Mato Grosso, and Mato Grosso do Sul. In the Barra do Garcas, Mato Grosso, the invasion by triatomines has been reported, with T. williami being the most common species. This study aimed to survey triatomine fauna and determine the Trypanosoma cruzi natural infection rates in triatomines in the urban area of Barra do Garcas, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Methods: Triatomine specimens were sampled by passive surveillance or active search by agents combating endemic diseases from 2019 to 2020. A parasitological feces diagnosis was performed to detect the presence of T. cruzi after the specimens were identified. Concerning T. cruzi identification, molecular diagnosis and genetic sequencing were performed to determine the strain, also called discrete typing units (DTUs). Results: The 211 triatomines were collected, distributed in specimens of T. williami (84.4%), P geniculatus (3.3%), P. diasi (1.4%), and R. neglectus (10.9%). Two colonies of T. williami were found through morphological analyses.These insects were sampled inside domiciles in an urban area neighboring Jardim Pitaluga (15 degrees 51'57.7 '' N, 052 degrees 16' 04.5 E). The records were sampled in September 2019 and January 2021. The rate of natural infection by T. cruzi was 39.4%. Two T. williami specimens from the sampled colonies were positive for the T. cruzi strain DTU IV. Conclusions: This is the first time that T. williami has been confirmed in an urban area of Barra do Garcas, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Further studies are needed for a clearer understanding of the ecology of this species for prevention and control mechanisms since its sampled specimens had a high rate of natural infection by T. cruzi."

Trypanosoma cruzi genotype may be an important determinant of the clinical chronic Chagas disease form and prognosis. This study aimed to identify the potential association between T. cruzi genotypes and the clinical presentations of chronic Chagas disease. Methodology/principal findings This is a retrospective study using T. cruzi isolated from blood culture samples of 43 patients with chronic Chagas disease. From 43 patients, 42 were born in Brazil, mainly in Southeast and Northeast Brazilian regions, and one patient was born in Bolivia. Their mean age at the time of blood collection was 52.413.2 years. The clinical presentation was as follows 51.1% cardiac form, 25.6% indeterminate form, and 23.3% cardiodigestive form. Discrete typing unit (DTU) was determined by multilocus conventional PCR. TcII (n = 40) and TcVI (n = 2) were the DTUs identified. DTU was unidentifiable in one patient. The average follow-up time after blood culture was 5.7 +/- 4.4 years. A total of 14 patients (32.5%) died and one patient underwent heart transplantation. The cause of death was sudden cardiac arrest in six patients, heart failure in five patients, not related to Chagas disease in one patient, and ignored in two patients. A total of 8 patients (18.6%) progressed, all of them within the cardiac or cardiodigestive forms. Conclusions/significance TcII was the main T. cruzi DTU identified in chronic Chagas disease Brazilian patients (92.9%) with either cardiac, indeterminate or cardiodigestive forms, born at Southeast and Northeast regions. Other DTU found in much less frequency was TcVI (4.8%). TcII was also associated to patients that evolved with heart failure or sudden cardiac arrest, the two most common and ominous consequences of the cardiac form of Chagas disease."

In this context, ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is a useful target for intra and interspecific molecular differentiation. Analyzing the rDNA of T. rangeli and comparison with other trypanosomatid species, two highly divergent regions (Tr beta 1 and Tr beta 2) within the 28S beta gene were found. Those regions were amplified and sequenced in KP1(+) and KP1(-) strains of T. rangeli, revealing group-specific polymorphisms useful for intraspecific distinction through restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Also, amplification of Tr beta 1 allowed differentiation between T. rangeli and T. cruzi.

Chagas disease is endemic in Latin America, and medical care for the disease is the major expense for Brazil's Universal Healthcare System (Sistema Unico de Saude (SUS). The efficacy of the available drugs benznidazole and nifurtimox are low for the chronic phase of Chagas disease, the phase in which most patients are diagnosed, and there are frequent side effects, and drug resistance occurs. The rapid deployment of new drug regimens that are effective for the chronic phase treatment is low-cost and less toxic than the currently available therapy, which is a global priority. Repurposing drugs already in clinical use with other combinations would be the fastest and safest strategy for treating Chagas disease patients. We hypothesize that the combined treatment using repurposing drugs with benznidazole will be more efficacious than benznidazole alone. This needs to be tested further both in vitro and in animal models to understand the efficacy of the treatment before performing human clinical trials.

These samples were used in the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fisher's exact test was used for statistical calculations with the aim of identifying risk factors. Out of the 330 animals, 105 (31.8%) were reactive in IFAT, 46 (13.0%) in ELISA and 20 (6.0%) in both serological tests. The results were not significant (p > 0.05) when submitted to statistical analysis for the studied variables. From PCR, 58 samples (17.5%) were found to be positive and, of these, one (0.3%) showed similarity to T. cruzi after sequencing.

There was a great amount of research devoted to diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the disease. One of the most important discoveries made since then, impacting the understanding of how the parasite interacts with the host's immune system, was the description of trans-sialidase. It is an unique enzyme, capable of masking the parasite's presence from the host, while at the same time dampening the activation of CD8+ T cells, the most important components of the immune response. Since the description of Chagas' disease in 1909, extensive research has identified important events in the disease in order to understand the biochemical mechanism that modulates T. cruzi-host cell interactions and the ability of the parasite to ensure its survival. The importance of the trans-sialidase enzyme brought life to many studies for the design of diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines. While many groups have been prolific, such efforts have encountered problems, among them: the fact that while T. cruzi have many genes that are unique to the parasite, it relies on multiple copies of them and the difficulty in providing epitopes that result in effective and robust immune responses. In this review, we aim to convey the importance of trans-sialidase as well as to provide a history, including the initial failures and the most promising successes in the chasing of a working vaccine for a disease that is endemic in many tropical countries, including Brazil."

A literature search demonstrates that few US obstetric care providers recognize the risk of vertical transmission for the neonate and the missed opportunity of infant treatment to decrease disease prevalence. Most women will be asymptomatic during pregnancy, as will their neonates, making routine laboratory screening a necessity for the identification of at-risk neonates. While the benefits of treating asymptomatic women identified in pregnancy are not as clear as the benefits for the infants, future health screenings for evidence of the progression of Chagas disease may be beneficial to these families. The literature suggests that screening for Chagas in pregnancy in the US can be done in a cost-effective way.

Our objective was to investigate the occurrence of infection with these parasites in wild animals from urban rainforest fragments in the city of Salvador, the largest city in the northeast region of Brazil. Sixty-five wild animals were captured, clinically examined, and sampled for parasite detection by PCR and culture. Ten different mammalian genera were identified, being 58% (38/65) marsupials. The prevalence of T. cruzi and Leishmania sp. infections was 13% and 43%, respectively. Both parasites were detected by PCR in 11% (7/65), three of which were also double infected as determined by culture. Among the 28 animals found infected with at least one parasite (43%, 28/65), 68% (19/28) were marsupials, two specimens were Callithrix sp. (7%), and one was Trinomys sp. (3%). Most infected animals (89%) had no clinical signs of disease. We found that healthy free-living animals from urban rainforest fragments harbored pathogenic trypanosomatids and should be included in epidemiology studies of diseases in big cities in tropical countries, as these cities grow and engulf rainforest remnants."

Since it is a chronic systemic infection, Chagas disease was long considered a potential contraindication for transplantation because of the risk of recurrence with immunosuppression. However, early South American experience in the 1980's established the feasibility of heart transplantation (HT) in patients with Chagas disease. Indeed, the first cardiac transplant for a recipient with CC was performed in 1985 in Brazil. Chagas etiology of heart failure has become the third most common indication for HT in South America. T. cruzi reactivation post-transplant is a common issue that requires prophylactic surveillance but responds well to appropriate therapy. Chagas reactivation has been associated with the potency of the immunosuppressive protocol and occurs more frequently after rejection episodes. Yet, many important questions regarding the management of Chagas HT candidates and recipients remain unanswered. For example, biventricular systolic failure is frequent in end-stage CC, but its impact on the modality of mechanical circulatory bridging has not been described. Also, there is no consensus regarding the most adequate immunosuppressive regimen that balances the risk of graft rejection and disease reactivation. The real efficacy and safety of HT for end-stage CC will only be appreciated when a Latin American transplant registry is established. This review covers the current state of the art of HT for CC.

Thus, the oral route of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and the consequences in the host must be taken into account when thinking on the mechanisms underlying the natural history of the disease. Distinct routes of parasite entry may differentially affect immune circuits, stimulating regional immune responses that impact on the overall profile of the host protective immunity. Experimental studies related to oral infection usually comprise inoculation in the mouth (oral infection, OI) or gavage (gastrointestinal infection, GI), being often considered as similar routes of infection. Hence, establishing a relationship between the inoculation site (OI or GI) with disease progression and the mounting of T. cruzi-specific regional immune responses is an important issue to be considered.

Several research efforts have been made over the last decade to find new chemical structures with better effectiveness and tolerance than standard anti-Chagas drugs. Among these, new sets of thiosemicarbazone and thiazole derivatives have exhibited potent in vitro activity against T. cruzi, especially for its extracellular forms (epimastigote and trypomastigote). In this work, we have developed three antiprotozoal quantitative structure-relationship (QSAR) models for Chagas disease based on the in vitro activity data reported as IC50 (mu M) and CC50 (mu M) over the last decade, particularly by Lima-Leite's group in Brazil. The models were developed using the replacement method (RM), a technique based on Multivariable Linear Regression (MLR), and external and internal validation methodologies, like the use of a test set, Leave-one-Out (LOO) cross-validation and Y-Randomization. Two of these QSAR models were developed for trypomastigotes form of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, one based on IC50 and the other on CC50 data; while the third QSAR model was developed for its epimastigotes form based on CC50 activity. Our models presented sound statistical parameters that endorses their prediction capability.

In Colombia, systematic data pertaining to the disease's magnitude in the general population and its distribution within regions are lacking. Our objective is to describe the prevalence of Chagas disease in Colombia through a meta-analysis and systematic review. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search using several electronic databases, gray literature, and reference lists of selected articles for population-based studies on Chagas disease prevalence in Colombia was performed between 1990 and 2017. Articles published in either English or Spanish were included. Pooled prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for Chagas disease in the general population using a meta-analysis random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity among studies. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether publication bias existed. Results: Seventeen articles with relevant prevalence data were identified from a total of 1213 references. The initial pooled estimate of Chagas disease prevalence across studies for the entire period was 4.10% (95% CI: 2.23-7.41). After removing studies with large effect and small sample sizes, the pooled estimate was 1.67% (95% CI: 0.95-2.92). A high degree of heterogeneity in most pooled estimates was observed, even after subgroup analysis. The Orinoquia region, rural areas, males, and persons aged >= 15 years yielded the highest pooled prevalence. Interpretation and Conclusion: Higher prevalence was observed in select regions, rural areas, and older teenagers and adults.

It also describes environmental factors in housings associated with insect occurrence and assesses the perception, knowledge, and preventive practices adopted by the population regarding CD. Blood samples of humans and dogs, and biological samples of triatomines, were collected between November 2018 and February 2019 and subjected to the detection of T. cruzi by serological and molecular biology tests. Also, we applied a questionnaire to research the perception, knowledge, and local practices of people related to CD.

District residents (n = 126) were seronegative for T. cruzi, while 17.5% (7/40) of the dogs were seropositive. The fact that residents are aware that triatomines can “cause” CD was configured as a protection factor for residents according to the fitted logistic regression model (p = 0.04). However, respondents have limited perception and knowledge about the CD, prevention and control practices for triatomines in a household. The results suggest the existence of a domestic cycle of transmission of T. cruzi between triatomines and dogs, configuring a latent risk of infection to the human population of Santo Inácio.

A total of 1,057 specimens (99% in peridomiciles, mainly chicken coops) of T. sordida were collected from 63 DUs (infestation: 47%; density: similar to 8 specimens/DU; crowding: similar to 17 specimens/infested DU; colonisation: 81%). Only six (0.6%) out of 945 specimens examined were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. The final adjusted logistic regression model indicated that the probability of T. sordida occurrence was higher in DU with wooden chicken coops, presence of > 30 animals in wooden corrals, presence of wood piles and presence of food storeroom. The results show the persistence of T. sordida in peridomestic habitats in rural localities of Central-West Brazil. However, the observed low intradomestic colonisation and minimal triatomine infection rates indicate that T. sordida has low potential to sustain high rates of T. cruzi transmission to residents of these localities."

We included all deaths reported in Brazil in which Chagas disease was mentioned in the death certificate either as an underlying or associated cause of death (multiple causes of death). Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates (per 100,000 inhabitants) were calculated and time trends analysis was performed using joinpoint regression models. In the study period, a total of 22,663,092 deaths were recorded in Brazil. Chagas disease was identified in 122,291 deaths (0.54%), 94.788 (77.5%) as an underlying cause and 27,503 (22.5%) as an associated cause. Average annual age-adjusted mortality rate was 3.22 deaths/100,000 inhabitants (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.14-3.30). Chronic Chagas disease with cardiac involvement was the predominant clinical presentation mentioned. The highest mortality rates were observed in males, age group ≥80 years, black race/skin color, schooling 1-3 years of study, and residents in the Central-West region. Age-adjusted mortality rates showed a significant declining trend at the national level in the period (Average Annual Percent Change: -3.1%; 95% CI: -3.3; -3.0), with different local patterns and a more pronounced reduction in important endemic areas in the past. The findings show that, despite a consistent decline in mortality rates in Brazil over the study period, Chagas disease remains an important and neglected cause of death in the country, showing a marked regional variation that has social and health care implications. In addition to the control measures for disease transmission, it is necessary to guarantee access, coverage, and quality of health care to Chagas disease patients, seeking to prevent the occurrence of severe forms and deaths from the disease. © 2021"

Three expeditions were conducted in the area: the first in 2012, soon after the human case, and two others in 2015. Sylvatic mammals were captured and submitted to blood collection for trypanosomatid parasitological and serological exams. Dogs from the surrounding areas where the sylvatic mammals were captured were also tested for T. cruzi infection. DNA samples were extracted from blood clots and positive hemocultures, submitted to polymerase chain reaction targeting SSU rDNA and gGAPDH genes, sequenced and phylogenetic analysed. Twenty-one wild mammals were captured in 2012, mainly rodents, and 17 mammals, mainly marsupials, were captured in the two expeditions conducted in 2015. Only four rodents demonstrated borderline serological T. cruzi test (IFAT), two in 2012 and two in 2015. Trypanosoma janseni was the main Trypanosoma species identified, and isolates were obtained solely from Didelphis aurita. In addition to biological differences, molecular differences are suggestive of genetic diversity in this flagellate species. Trypanosoma sp. DID was identified in blood clots from D. aurita in single and mixed infections with T. janseni. Concerning dogs, 12 presented mostly borderline serological titers for T. cruzi and no positive hemoculture. In blood clots from 11 dogs, T. cruzi DNA was detected and characterized as TcI (n = 9) or TcII (n = 2). Infections by Trypanosoma rangeli lineage E (n = 2) and, for the first time, Trypanosoma caninum, Trypanosoma dionisii, and Crithidia mellificae (n = 1 each) were also detected in dogs.

Current therapies are not effective in altering the outcome of T. cruzi infection, and as RvD1 has been evaluated as a therapeutic agent in various inflammatory diseases, we examined if exogenous RvD1 could modulate the pathogenesis of Chagas disease in a murine model. CD-1 mice infected with the T. cruzi Brazil strain were treated with RvD1. Mice were administered 3 mu g/kg of body weight RvD1 intraperitoneally on days 5, 10, and 15 to examine the effect of RvD1 on acute disease or administered the same dose on days 60, 65, and 70 to examine its effects on chronic infection. RvD1 therapy increased the survival rate and controlled parasite replication in mice with acute infection and reduced the levels of interferon gamma and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in mice with chronic infection. In addition, there was an increase in interleukin-10 levels with RvD1 therapy in both mice with acute infection and mice with chronic infection and a decrease in TGF-beta levels and collagen content in cardiac tissue.

OBJECTIVE To estimate the actual risk in a changing world it is necessary to consider the historical vector distribution and correlate this distribution with the presence of cases and climate change. METHODS Potential distribution models of Triatoma infestans and Chagas disease were performed using Maxent, a machine-learning method. FINDINGS Climate change appears to play a major role in the reemergence of Chagas' disease and T. infestans in Chile. The distribution of both T. infestans and Chagas' disease correlated with maximum temperature, and the precipitation during the driest month. The overlap of Chagas' disease and T. infestans distribution areas was high. The distribution of T. infestans, under two global change scenarios, showed a minimal reduction tendency in suitable areas. MAIN CONCLUSION The impact of temperature and precipitation on the distribution of T. infestans, as shown by the models, indicates the need for aggressive control efforts; the current control measures, including T. infestans control campaigns, should be maintained with the same intensity as they have at present, avoiding sylvatic foci, intrusions, and recolonisation of human dwellings."

Methods: Twenty T. cruzi stocks isolated from 16 chagasic patients, two Panstrongylus lutzi, one Galea spixii, and one Euphractus sexcinctus, from different localities in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, were characterized by genotyping the 3' region of the 24S alpha rRNA gene, the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 gene, and the spliced leader intergenic region. Results: TcIII was identified in 18.7% (3/16) of patients from different municipalities, as well as in P. lutzi, G. spixii, and E. sexcinctus, indicating the connection between the sylvatic and domestic cycles in this Brazilian semi-arid region. TcI and TcII were also detected, in 37.5% (6/16) and 43.8% (7/16) of patients, respectively. These DTUs were associated with cardiac, digestive, and indeterminate clinical forms, while TcIII was identified only in patients with the indeterminate form. Conclusions: The occurrence of these DTUs reveals important phylogenetic diversity in T. cruzi isolates from humans. TcIII is reported for the first time in northeastern Brazil.

The northeastern region of Brazil is endemic for Chagas disease and has the largest diversity of triatomine species. T. cruzi development in its triatomine vector depends on diverse factors, including the composition of bacterial gut microbiota. Methods: We characterized the triatomines captured in the municipality of Russas (Ceara) by sequencing the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. The composition of the bacterial community in the gut of peridomestic Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma pseudomaculata was investigated using culture independent methods based on the amplification of the 16S rRNA gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), DNA fragment cloning, Sanger sequencing and 454 pyrosequencing. Additionally, we identified TcI and TcII types of T. cruzi by sequencing amplicons from the gut metagenomic DNA with primers for the mini-exon gene. Results: Triatomines collected in the peridomestic ecotopes were diagnosed as T. pseudomaculata and T. brasiliensis by comparing their COI sequence with GenBank. The rate of infection by T. cruzi in adult triatomines reached 80% for T. pseudomaculata and 90% for T. brasiliensis. According to the DNA sequences from the DGGE bands, the triatomine gut microbiota was primarily composed of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. However, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were also detected, although in much lower proportions. Serratia was the main genus, as it was encountered in all samples analyzed by DGGE and 454 pyrosequencing. Members of Corynebacterinae, a suborder of the Actinomycetales, formed the next most important group. The cloning and sequencing of full-length 16S rRNA genes confirmed the presence of Serratia marcescens, Dietzia sp., Gordonia terrae, Corynebacterium stationis and Corynebacterium glutamicum. Conclusions: The study of the bacterial microbiota in the triatomine gut has gained increased attention because of the possible role it may play in the epidemiology of Chagas disease by competing with T. cruzi. Culture independent methods have shown that the bacterial composition of the microbiota in the guts of peridomestic triatomines is made up by only few bacterial species."

Infection is often subclinical, but severe disease has been described in both free-ranging and captive primates. Panstrongylus megistus, a major T. cruzi vector, was found infesting a small-primate unit at Brasilia zoo (ZooB), Brazil. ZooB lies close to a gallery-forest patch where T. cruzi circulates naturally. Here, we combine parasitological and molecular methods to investigate a focus of T. cruzi infection involving triatomine bugs and Neotropical primates at a zoo located in the Brazilian Savannah. Methods: We assessed T. cruzi infection in vectors using optical microscopy (n = 34) and nested PCR (n = 50). We used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to examine blood samples from 26 primates and necropsy samples from two primates that died during the study. We determined parasite lineages in five vectors and two primates by comparing glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6pi) gene sequences. Results: Trypanosoma cruzi was found in 44 vectors and 17 primates (six genera and eight species); one Mico chrysoleucus and one Saguinus niger had high parasitaemias. Trypanosoma cruzi DNA was detected in three primates born to qPCR-negative mothers at ZooB and in the two dead specimens. One Callithrix geoffroyi became qPCR-positive over a two-year follow-up. All G6pi sequences matched T. cruzi lineage Td. Conclusions: Our findings strongly suggest vector-borne T. cruzi transmission within a small-primate unit at ZooB - with vectors, and perhaps also parasites, presumably coming from nearby gallery forest. Periodic checks for vectors and parasites would help eliminate T. cruzi transmission foci in captive-animal facilities. This should be of special importance for captive-breeding programs involving endangered mammals, and would reduce the risk of accidental T. cruzi transmission to keepers and veterinarians."

These animals are easy to handle because they are crowded and have limited movement. Dogs, due to the close relationship with humans, are considered the main domestic reservoirs in the peridomiciliary cycle of American trypanosomiasis infection in humans. Therefore, in several countries studies are carried out to assess the occurrence of infection in these animals. This work evaluated the occurrence of Trypanosoma cruzi in dogs from shelters in the city of Aracaju, Sergipe. This was an observational and cross-sectional study to detect the occurrence of T. cruzi in blood samples from shelter dogs using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the TcZ1/TcZ2 primers. A total of 168 blood samples from dogs (104 females and 64 males) were collected and subjected to DNA and PCR extraction, and seventeen (10.1%) samples showed amplification of the product of the expected size. The TcZ1/TcZ2 primer pair used is considered specific for T. cruzi, and it is capable of amplifying all strains without amplifying other Trypanosoma species. The shelters evaluated had different physical infrastructure; animals positive for T. cruzi were found in all of them, as confirmed by sequencing. It is concluded that shelter dogs, as well as other domestic animals, can function as indicators of the occurrence of T. cruzi in Aracaju-SE, providing relevant epidemiological information for health surveillance and monitoring of Trypanosomatid infections. © 2020 Elsevier B.V."

Elucidating enzootic cycles of the different lineages is important for understanding the ecology of this parasite, the emergence of new outbreaks of Chagas disease and for guiding control strategies. Direct lineage identification by genotyping is hampered by limitations of parasite isolation and culture. An indirect method is to identify lineage-specific serological reactions in infected individuals; here we describe its application with sylvatic Brazilian primates. Methods: Synthetic peptides representing lineage-specific epitopes of the T. cruzi surface protein TSSA were used in ELISA with sera from Atlantic Forest Leontopithecus chrysomelas (golden-headed lion tamarin), L. rosalia (golden lion tamarin), Amazonian Sapajus libidinosus (black-striped capuchin) and Alouatta belzebul (red-handed howler monkey). Results: The epitope common to lineages TcII, TcV and TcVI was recognised by sera from 15 of 26 L. chrysomelas and 8 of 13 L. rosalia. For 12 of these serologically identified TcII infections, the identity of the lineage infection was confirmed by genotyping T. cruzi isolates. Of the TcII/TcV/TcVI positive sera 12 of the 15 L. chrysomelas and 2 of the 8 L. rosalia also reacted with the specific epitope restricted to TcV and TcVI. Sera from one of six S. libidinous recognised the TcIV/TcIII epitopes. Conclusions: This lineage-specific serological surveillance has verified that Atlantic Forest primates are reservoir hosts of at least TcII, and probably TcV and TcVI, commonly associated with severe Chagas disease in the southern cone region of South America. With appropriate reagents, this novel methodology is readily applicable to a wide range of mammal species and reservoir host discovery."

In this study, we investigated bats together with non-volant mammals, dogs, and triatomines to explore other possible T. c. cruzi reservoirs/hosts in the area. Seventy-three non-volant mammals and 186 bats were captured at three sites within the Guarapari municipality, Espirito Santo state. Rio da Prata and Amarelos sites exhibited greater richness in terms of non-volant mammals and bats species, respectively. The marsupial Metachirus nudicaudatus, the rodent Trinomys paratus, and the bats Artibeus lituratus and Carollia perspicillata were the most frequently captured species. As determined by positive hemocultures, only two non-volant mammals were found to be infected by Trypanosoma species: Monodelphis americana, which was infected by T. cascaveffi, T. dionisii and Trypanosoma sp., and Caffithrix geoffroyi, which was infected by T. minasense. Bats presented T. c. cruziTcl and TcIII/V, T. c. marinkellei, T. dionisii, T. rangeli B and D, and Trypanosoma sp. infections. Seven dogs were infected with T. cruzi based only on serological exams.

The disease is found beyond Latin America, including Japan, the USA, France, Spain, and Australia, and is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Dr. Carlos Chagas described Chagas disease in 1909 in Brazil, and hepatomegaly was among the clinical signs observed. Currently, hepatomegaly is cited in most papers published which either study acutely infected patients or experimental models, and we know that the parasite can infect multiple cell types in the liver, especially Kupffer cells and dendritic cells. Moreover, liver damage is more pronounced in cases of oral infection, which is mainly found in the Amazon region. However, the importance of liver involvement, including the hepatic immune response, in disease progression does not receive much attention. In this review, we present the very first paper published approaching the liver's participation in the infection, as well as subsequent papers published in the last century, up to and including our recently published results. We propose that, after infection, activated peripheral T lymphocytes reach the liver and induce a shift to a pro-inflammatory ambient environment.

The epidemiology of T. cruzi has been changing in that currently the majority of the cases and/or outbreaks of Chagas disease occur by the ingestion of comestibles contaminated by T. cruzi metacyclic forms. These cases/outbreaks occur in distinct regional scenarios, mainly in the Amazon biome and are related to the local interaction mode of humans with their surroundings, as well as with the overall local ecological peculiarities. As trypanosomiasis caused by T. cruzi is primarily a zoonosis, understanding the variables that influences its transmission in the wild as well as the role played by the extant fauna in the maintenance of the parasite, is critical in establishing control measures. Here, we present the results of our studies of T. cruzi infection of free ranging wild mammalian fauna in the five biomes of Brazil, a country of continental dimensions. From 1992 up to 2017, we examined a total of 6587 free-ranging non-volant wild mammal specimens. Our studies found that 17% of mammals were seropositive and 8% of all animals displayed positive hemocultures indicative of high parasitemia and, consequently, of infectivity potential.

Additionally, Didelphis spp. demonstrated to be a competent bioaccumulator of TcI diversity. Chiroptera were distinguished for hosting the greatest diversity of species and genotypes of Trypanosoma spp. Additionally the observation of the higher host range of some Trypanosoma spp., shows the need to reassess the ecology of representatives of the taxon.

The kDNA-PCR was used to select 124 T. cruzi positive triatomine samples, of which 117 were successfully genotyped by fluorescent fragment length barcoding (FFLB). Moreover, the T. cruzi load quantification was performed using a multiplex TaqMan qPCR. Our findings showed a clear ecotypic segregation between TcI and TcII harboured by T. brasiliensis (p<0.001). Although no genotypes were ecotypically exclusive, TcI was predominant in peridomestic ecotopes (86%).

Additionally, TcII (median value=299,504 T. cruzi/intestine unit equivalents) had more than twice (p=0.1) the parasite load of TcI (median value=149,077 T. cruzi/intestine unit equivalents), which can be attributed to a more ancient co-evolution with T. brasiliensis. The higher prevalence of TcII in the sylvatic T. brasiliensis (70%) could be associated with a more diversified source of bloodmeals for wild insect populations. Either TcI or TcII may have been responsible for the ChD outbreak that occurred in the city of Marcelino Vieira.

All of the animal's physiological parameters were within normal levels. Blood samples and cytological laminas from the lesioned area were collected and sent to the Laboratory of Veterinary Clinical Pathology in the same institution. The cytological exam showed monomorphic population of great round cells with a round nucleus, condensed chromatin and one to two prominent nucleolus, abundant and slightly basophilic cytoplasm, with multiple stippled vacuoles, thus confirming a Transmissible venereal tumor (TVT) case. With the blood exam one observed a thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia with a deviation on the left and the presence of a trypomastigote form of Trypanosoma sp. in the blood smears. A complete blood sample was sent to the Laboratory of Pathology and Molecular Biology from the Fiocruz-BA (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in the State of Bahia), being identified by the PCR technique, T. cruzi. Discussion: During the complete blood count, specifically using the blood smear, the microscopic visualization of the trypomastigote form of the Trypanosoma sp., a hemoparasite of filiform aspect, with undulating membrane over the whole body and free flagellum, confirming a case of trypanosomiasis. Such diagnostics had not been considered up to this moment, as the animal did not present any clinic symptomatology that indicated the pathological condition. The high levels of parasitemia presented by the animal, confirmed by the presence of the protozoan in the blood smear, probably indicate the acute phase of the infection, period in which the multiplication and development of the agent is higher, consequently allowing the visualization of the hemoparasite in the lamina. Although the TVT had proved to be the main derogatory factor of sanity and wellbeing of the animal, one calls the attention in this case for the trypanosomiasis, a zoonosis that causes great risk to the sole health, highlighting that the canine species is taken as an important reservoir of T. cruzi, relevant for the maintenance and interaction among the domestic and wild cycles of the Chagas Disease. This is the first report of a canine naturally infected by T. cruzi in the west Region of the State of Bahia. It is, thus, important to emphasize its significance once dogs can be reservoirs of the protozoan, acting in their life cycle and epidemiological chain of the Chagas Disease, enabling the infection of triatomines and humans. Future studies should be done with the purpose of determining the predominance of the agent in the region of the city of Barra, in the State of Bahia."

In a companion study, our group found that a high-fat diet (HFD) protected mice from T.cruzi-induced myocardial damage and significantly reduced post-infection mortality during acute T.cruzi infection. MethodsIn the present study metabolic syndrome was induced prior to T. cruzi infection by feeding a high fat diet. Also, mice were treated with anti-diabetic drug metformin. ResultsIn the present study, the lethality of T.cruzi (Brazil strain) infection in CD-1 mice was reduced from 55% to 20% by an 8-week pre-feeding of an HFD to induce obesity and metabolic syndrome. The addition of metformin reduced mortality to 3%. ConclusionsIt is an interesting observation that both the high fat diet and the metformin, which are known to differentially attenuate host metabolism, effectively modified mortality in T.cruzi-infected mice. In humans, the metabolic syndrome, as presently construed, produces immune activation and metabolic alterations that promote complications of obesity and diseases of later life, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Using an evolutionary approach, we hypothesized that for millions of years, the channeling of host resources into immune defences starting early in life ameliorated the effects of infectious diseases, especially chronic infections, such as tuberculosis and Chagas disease. In economically developed countries in recent times, with control of the common devastating infections, epidemic obesity and lengthening of lifespan, the dwindling benefits of the immune activation in the first half of life have been overshadowed by the explosion of the syndrome's negative effects in later life.

Although CD is not considered endemic in Rio de Janeiro State (RJ), Brazil, we identified patients with CD born in RJ and investigated the possible autochthonous transmission in the state. Methods: Patients born in RJ and followed in our institution between 1986 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. The cases identified as autochthonous transmission were submitted to epidemiological, clinical, serological, parasitological and molecular studies. Sectional field study with serological survey, research of sylvatic reservoirs and vectors was conducted in rural areas where patients were born. Results: Among 1963 patients, 69 (3.5%) were born in RJ. From these, 15 (21.7%) were considered to have acquired the infection by autochthonous transmission. Cardiac form was the commonest form of presentation (60%). In rural areas in RJ northern region, sylvatic cycles of Trypanosoma cruzi and domestic invasion by Triatoma vitticeps were identified, and CD prevalence among inhabitants was 0.74%. TcI genotype was identified in sylvatic reservoirs and vectors. The genotype (mixed infection Tcl/TcVI) could be identified in one of the autochthonous cases. Conclusions: The autochthonous vectorial transmission of CD occurs in RJ, probably due to wild cycles of T. cruzi and sylvatic vectors, such as T. vitticeps. Therefore, the health authorities should evaluate if RJ should be included in the original endemic area of CD and CD should be included in the diagnostic work out of cardiomyopathy of patients born in RJ. Moreover, control and educational measures should be put into place in the risk areas."

Potential confounding variables included sociodemographic characteristics and an array of health measures. The prevalence of T. cruzi infection was 37.5% and 56.3% of those infected had a major ECG abnormality. Baseline T. cruzi infection was correlated with higher levels of African and Native American ancestry, which in turn were strongly associated with poor socioeconomic circumstances. Cardiomyopathy in infected persons was not significantly associated with African or Native American ancestry levels. Infected persons with a major ECG abnormality were at increased risk of 15-year mortality relative to their counterparts with no such abnormalities (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.80; 95% 1.41, 2.32). African and Native American ancestry levels had no significant effect modifying this association. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings indicate that African and Native American ancestry have no influence on the presence of major ECG abnormalities and had no influence on the ability of an ECG abnormality to predict mortality in older people infected with T. cruzi. In contrast, our results revealed a strong and independent association between prevalent T. cruzi infection and higher levels of African and Native American ancestry.

In the Espirito Santo state (southeastern Brazil), a fatal case of a patient with ACD led us to investigate the enzootic scenario to avoid the development of new cases. At the studied locality, Triatoma vitticeps exhibited high T. cruzi infection rates and frequently invaded residences. Methods: Sylvatic and domestic mammals in the Rio da Prata locality, where the ACD case occurred, and in four surrounding areas (Baia Nova, Buenos Aires, Santa Rita and Todos os Santos) were examined and underwent parasitological and serological tests. Triatomines were collected for a fecal material exam, culturing and mini-exon gene molecular characterization, followed by RFLP-PCR of H3/Alul. Paraffin-embedded cardiac tissue of a patient was washed with xylene to remove paraffin and DNA was extracted using the phenol-chloroform method. For genotype characterization, PCR was performed to amplify the 1f8, GPI and 18S rRNA genes. In the case of V7V8 SSU rRNA, the PCR products were molecularly cloned. PCR products were sequenced and compared to sequences in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood method with 1000 bootstrap replicates was performed. Results: None of the animals showed positive hemocultures. Three rodents and two dogs showed signs of infection, as inferred from borderline serological titers. T. vitticeps was the only triatomine species identified and showed T. cruzi infection by DTUs TcI and TcIV. The analysis of cardiac tissue DNA showed mixed infection by T. cruzi (DTUs I, II, III and IV) and Trypanosoma dionisii. Conclusions: Each case or outbreak of ACD should be analyzed as a particular epidemiological occurrence. The results indicated that mixed infections in humans may play a role in pathogenicity and may be more common than is currently recognized. Direct molecular characterization from biological samples is essential because this procedure avoids parasite selection. T. dionisii may under certain and unknown circumstances infect humans. The distribution of T. cruzi DTUS TcIII and TcIV in Brazilian biomes is broader than has been assumed to date."

In the State of Amazonas, the fi rst chagasic infection was reported in 1977, and the fi rst acute CD case was recorded in 1980. After initiatives to integrate acute CD diagnostics with the malaria laboratories network, reports of acute CD cases have increased. Most of these cases are associated with oral transmission by the consumption of contaminated food. Chronic cases have also been diagnosed, mostly in the indeterminate form. These cases were detected by serological surveys in cardiologic outpatient clinics and during blood donor screening. Considering that the control mechanisms adopted in Brazil’s classic transmission areas are not fully applicable in the Amazon, it is important to understand the disease behavior in this region, both in the acute and chronic cases.

There are currently six recognised, genetically distinct, monophyletic clades designated discrete typing units (DTUs). TcI has the broadest geographical range and most genetic diversity evidenced by a wide range of genetic markers applied to isolates spanning a vast geographical range across Latin America. However, little is known of the diversity of TcI that exists within sylvatic mammals across the geographical expanse of Brazil. Results: Twenty-nine sylvatic TcI isolates spanning multiple ecologically diverse biomes across Brazil were analyzed by the application of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) using four nuclear housekeeping genes. Results revealed extensive genetic diversity and also incongruence among individual gene trees. There was no association of intralineage genotype with geography or with any particular biome, with the exception of isolates from Caatinga that formed a single cluster. However, haplotypic analyses of METIII and LYT1 constitutive markers provided evidence of recombination events in two isolates derived from Didelphis marsupialis and D. albiventris, respectively. For diversity studies all possible combinations of markers were assessed with the objective of selecting the combination of gene targets that are most resolutive using the minimum number of genes. A panel of just three gene fragments (DHFR-TS, LYT1 and METIII) discriminated 26 out of 35 genotypes. Conclusions: These findings showed geographical association of genotypes clustering in Caatinga but more characteristically TcI genotypes widely distributed without specific association to geographical areas or biomes.

METHODS Archived human term placenta paraffin-embedded blocks were used, from women with CD (CDP), and no pathology (NP). Immunohistochemistry tests were performed for Ki67 to calculate the proliferation index ( PI) of cytotrophoblast (CTB) and Syncytin-1, a fusion marker of syncytiotrophoblast (STB). Hematoxylin/Eosin stained sections were employed to analyze STB percentages, STB detachment areas and syncytial knots quantity. Non parametric Student's t-tests were performed (p < 0.05). RESULTS Syncytial knots and STB detachment significantly increased in placental villi from the CDP group.

Ecological and socioeconomic factors associated with these urban transitions create conditions for the potential transmission of infectious diseases, which was demonstrated for Chagas disease. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed 930 triatomines, mainly Triatoma tibiamaculata, collected in artificial and sylvatic environments (forests near houses) of a suburban area of the city of Salvador, Bahia State, Brazil between 2007 and 2011. Most triatomines were captured at peridomiciles. Adult bugs predominated in all studied environments, and nymphs were scarce inside houses. Molecular analyses of a randomly selected sub-sample (n=212) of triatomines showed Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates of 65%, 50% and 56% in intradomestic, peridomestic and sylvatic environments, respectively. We detected the T. cruzi lineages I and II and mixed infections. We also showed that T. tibiamaculata fed on blood from birds (50%), marsupials (38%), ruminants (7%) and rodents (5%). The probability of T. cruzi infection was higher in triatomines that fed on marsupial blood (odds ratio (OR)=1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.22-3.11). Moreover, we observed a protective effect against infection in bugs that fed on bird blood (OR=0.43, 95% CI=0.30-0.73). Conclusions/Significance The frequent invasion of houses by infected triatomines indicates a potential risk of T. cruzi transmission to inhabitants in this area.

However, triatomines were not found colonizing residences and mammals in the surrounding areas did not present T. cruzi infection. To date, the biotic and abiotic variables that modulate T. vitticeps occurrence and T. cruzi infection in ES State are still unknown. The aim of this study was to identify the environmental variables that modulate their occurrence. Local thematic maps were generated for two response variables: T. vitticeps occurrence and T. cruzi infection. The following explanatory variables were tested: climate (temperature, relative air humidity and rainfall), altitude elevation, mammalian species richness as well as soil and vegetation types. Spatiotemporal distribution patterns and correla-tion levels between response and explanatory variables were assessed through spatial statistics and map algebra modelling. The central and southern mesoregions presented higher T. vitticeps and T. cruzi distributions and can be considered transmission hotspots. The explanatory variables that can explain these phenomena were relative air humidity, average temperature, soil type, altitude ele-vation and mammalian species richness.

Methods: The T. cruzi strain, Pm, was isolated in a culture medium from the evolutionary forms present in the hindgut of a live male specimen of P. megistus found in the Jabaquara subway in Sao Paulo City. The sample from the triatomine showed trypomastigote forms of Trypanosomatidae, which were inoculated in the peritoneum of Balb/c mice. The sample was then inoculated in Liver Infusion Tryptose medium and J774 cells for the molecular identification and characterization of the parasite. The Pm strain of T. cruzi was identified by isolation in axenic culture medium, and based on the morphology, cell infection, growth kinetics, and molecular characterization. Results: After isolation, the protozoan was identified as T. cruzi. No parasites were detected in the peripheral blood of the animal, which can be a characteristic inherent to the strain of T. cruzi that was isolated. Cell invasion assays were performed in triplicate in the J774 cell line to confirm the invasive ability of the Pm strain and revealed amastigote forms of the parasite within macrophages. Conclusions: Our biological and molecular characterizations helped understand parasite-host interactions and their evolutionary history in context of the associations between vectors, ecotopes, hosts, and groups of the parasite."

The main vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi are haematophagous insects, the triatomines. Only a few reports are available about the occurrence of these wild vectors and their contact with the inhabitants of the riverside regions of the Amazon. This study describes the unusual behaviour of the triatomines that have invaded the homes of the residents of Abaetetuba, the city that has the second highest number of cases of Chagas disease. Methods: Two cross-sectional studies were conducted using sero-epidemiological surveys of the inhabitants of Abaetetuba with registered triatomine home invasions. The frequencies of the variables of interestwere analysed using Epi Info version 7.2. Results: In 2014 and 2017, 145 persons registered home invasions of triatomines in their domiciles and 16.55% reported having been bitten by insects. The environmental features described indicated potential conditions for the persistence of the parasite's life cycle. Of the enrolled inhabitants, 0.47% were positive for immunoglobulin G anti-T. cruzi antibodies. Conclusions: Home invasions of triatomines were confirmed in two periods, with a description of unusual behaviour for the genus Rhodnius. The use of serological surveillance in human populations at risk of this occurrence may constitute a new tool for the early detection of silent infections."

Although the vectorial transmission of Chagas disease has been controlled in Brazil there are other ways of transmission, such as the ingestion of T. cruzi contaminated food, which ensures the continuation of this zoonosis. Here, we demonstrate the influence of the inoculation route on the establishment and development of the SC2005 T. cruzi strain infection in mice. Groups of Swiss mice were infected intragastrically (IG) or intraperitoneally (IP) with the T. cruzi SC2005 strain derived from an outbreak of oral Chagas disease. The results revealed that 100% of IP infected mice showed parasitemia, while just 36% of IG infected showed the presence of the parasite in blood. The parasitemia peaks were later and less intense in the IG infected mice. Mortality of the IP infected animals was more intense and earlier when compared to the IG infected mice. In the IP infected mice leucopenia occurred in the early infection followed by leucocytosis, correlating positively with the increase of the parasites. However, in the IG infected mice only an increase in monocytes was observed, which was positively correlated with the increase of the parasites. Histopathological analyses revealed a myotropic pattern of the SC2005 strain with the presence of inflammatory infiltrates and parasites in different organs of the animals infected by both routes as well as fibrosis foci and collagen redistribution. The flow cytometric analysis demonstrated a fluctuation of the T lymphocyte population in the blood, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes of the infected animals. T. cruzi DNA associated with the presence of inflammatory infiltrates was detected by PCR in the esophagus, stomach and intestine of all infected mice. These findings are important for the understanding of the pathogenesis of T. cruzi infection by both inoculation routes."

One of the current major challenges is to find an association between Trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs) and clinical manifestations of the disease. In this study, we used a multilocus conventional PCR and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) approaches to perform the molecular typing and parasite load quantification directly from blood specimens of 65 chronic Chagas disease patients. All patients were recruited at the same health center, but their place of birth were widely distributed in different geographic regions of Brazil. Of the 65 patients, 35 (53.8%) presented positive amplification by real time qPCR, being 20 (30.7%) with the clinical indeterminate form and 15 (23.1%) with the cardiac form of the disease. The parasite load median for all positive patients was 2.54 [1.43–11.14] parasite equivalents/mL (par. Eq./mL), with the load ranging from 0.12 to 153.66 par. Eq./mL. Noteworthy, the parasite load was significantly higher in patients over 70 years old (median 20.05 [18.29–86.86] par. Eq./mL). Using guanidine-EDTA blood samples spiked with reference T. cruzi strains, belonging to the six DTUs, it was possible to genotype the parasite up to 0.5 par. Eq./mL, with high specificity. Of the patients with positive qPCR, it was possible to identify the T. cruzi DTU in 28 patients (80%). For the remaining patients (20%), at least a partial result was obtained. Analysis of specimens showed prevalences of TcVI, TcII and mixed infection TcVI+TcII equal to 40%, 17.1% and 14.3%, respectively. In addition, two patients were infected by TcV, and one patient was coinfected by TcIII+TcVI, These last three patients were in stage A of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC), and they were born at the Bahia State (northeast region of Brazil). When T. cruzi genotypes were compared with the parasite load, more elevated parasite loads were observed in patients infected by TcII in general (parasite load median of 7.56 par. Eq./mL) in comparison to patients infected by TcVI (median of 2.35 par. Eq./mL). However, while the frequency of CCC was 50% in patients infected by TcVI and TcV, only 16.7% of patients infected by TcII evolved to CCC. Taking together, our results contribute to update the epidemiological knowledge of T. cruzi DTUs in Brazil, and highlight the age of patient and infection by TcII as important features that lead to the observation of higher parasitemia levels. © 2018 Rodrigues-dos-Santos et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/."

OBJECTIVES This study identified eco-epidemiological changes in Chagas disease in northern Minas Gerais state, Brazil, and considered the influence of environmental shifts and both natural and anthropogenic effects. METHODS Domicile infestation and Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates were obtained from triatomines and sylvatic reservoirs during the following two time periods: the 1980s and 2007/2008. Entomological and climatic data with land cover classification derived from satellite imagery were integrated into a geographic information system (GIS), which was applied for atmospheric correction, segmentation, image classification, and mapping and to analyse data obtained in the field. Climatic data were analysed and compared to land cover classifications. RESULTS A comparison of current data with data obtained in the 1980's showed that T. sordida colonised domiciliary areas in both periods, and that T. pseudomaculata did not colonise these areas. There was a tendency toward a reduction in T. cruzi infection rates in sylvatic reservoirs, and of triatomines captured in both households and in the sylvatic environment. T. sordida populations have reduced in the sylvatic environment, while T. pseudomaculata showed an expanding trend in the region compared to counts observed in the 1980's in the sylvatic environment. This may be related to high deforestation rates as well as gradual increases in land surface temperature (LST) and temperatures along the years. MAIN CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest a geographical expansion of species into new biomes as a result of anthropogenic and climatic changes that directly interfere with the reproductive and infection processes of vectors."

For Triatoma brasiliensis in the Caatinga, in the northeast of Brazil, seasonal differences influence feeding eclecticism and rates of T. cruzi infection. The objective of the present study was to monitor food sources and to characterize the populations of T. cruzi associated with T. brasiliensis in wild and domestic environments in the Caatinga of northeast Brazil.MethodsA cross-sectional study based on a search for triatomines in wild and domestic environments, was undertaken at five different time periods from 2009 to 2015. Insects from 2015 were used for identification of food sources. Two universal primers, based on the conserved regions of the 12S rRNA locus, were used to amplify fragments of 215 bp. The content of the intestinal tract of triatomines was identified by a comparison between the sequences obtained and those deposited in the GenBank database, using BLAST. In triatomines with parasitological diagnosis of infection by trypanosomatids, xenoculture was performed for the isolation and characterization of strains, using cox2, the amplification of the SL-IL mini-exon intergenic spacer and the polymorphism of the D7 divergent domain of the gene 24rDNA-LSU.ResultsFood sources were identified in 76.3% (213/279) T. brasiliensis specimens sampled in 2015. The most frequent sources in a total of 20 vertebrate species were: rodents (58%, 123/213), ruminants (30%, 64/213) and cats (6%, 12/213). A total of 49% (44/89) of the samples of T. cruzi isolated in the period from 2009 to 2015 were characterized: TcII (43%, 19/44), TcI (41%, 18/44) and TcIII (16%, 7/44).ConclusionsThe feeding eclecticism of T. brasiliensis shows its importance in maintaining the transmission dynamics of T. cruzi, with evidence of intense circulation between anthropic and wild environments. Attention should be placed on the association among T. brasiliensis, rodents and ruminants, in addition to the presence of TcIII in the study region."

The main motivation of this work was an acute human case of Chagas disease reported in 2008 in the municipality of Sobral. Methodology/principal findings We analyzed data from community-based entomological surveillance carried out from 2010 to 2014. Triatomine natural T. cruzi infection was assessed by examination of insect feces by optical microscopy. Sites of triatomine capture were georeferenced through Google Earth and analyzed with ArcGIS. A total of 191 triatomines were collected, consisting of 82.2% Triatoma pseudomaculata, 7.9% Rhodnius nasutus, 5.8% T. brasiliensis, 3.7% Panstrongylus lutzi, and 0.5% P. megistus, with an overall natural infection index of 17.8%. Most infestations were reported in the districts of Dom Jose (36.2%), Padre Palhano (24.7%), and Alto do Cristo (10.6%). The overwhelming majority of insects (185/96.9%) were captured inside houses, and most insects tended to be collected in intermittent peaks. Moreover, captured triatomines tended to constitute colonies. The acute case reported in 2008 was found to be situated within a T. pseudomaculata hotspot. Conclusion The triatomine collection events carried out by dwellers were aggregated in time and space into distinct foci, suggesting that insects are intermittently and artificially introduced into the city, possibly via accidental migration from their natural reservoirs. The relatively high T. cruzi infection rate indicates considerable circulation of the parasite in these areas, increasing the risk of vector-borne Chagas disease infection. These data suggest a need to strengthen epidemiological surveillance and integrate appropriate control actions targeting triatomines, T. cruzi reservoirs, and human populations. Our data also identify Chagas disease transmission as a hazard in urban areas of Sobral."

A multicriteria analysis was thus performed using the PROMETHEE II algorithm, implemented in the Pradin software. The criteria for assessing the model consisted of three indices built from the following indicators: (a) epidemiological, directly related to chronic Chagas disease, (b) related to the evolution in chronic Chagas disease, and (c) related to access to health services. Saaty's Fundamental Scale was used to define the indicators' weights, with greater importance assigned to those directly related to chronic Chagas disease and to those with greater reliability and respective quality of information.

We investigated the occurrence of parasites and bacterial diseases in one of three free-ranging groups of S. flavius in a small forest patch in Paraiba state, Northeast Brazil. We tested for antibodies against Leishmania spp., Trypanosoma cruzi, Toxoplasma gondii, Leptospira spp. (24 strains), and Brucella spp.. We used molecular analysis to detect Plasmodium spp., and evaluated blood smears for the presence of hemoparasites. All individuals tested negative for Leptospira spp. and B. abortus, but 8 of 48 (16%) presented antibodies for both Leishmania spp. and T. cruzi. We identified antibodies to T. gondii in 12% of the individuals tested. Plasmodium brasilianum infection was present in 4% of the individuals tested, and blood smears showed microfilariae parasites in 46% of the individuals tested. The occurrence of these infectious diseases in S. flavius may pose a significant threat in terms of reduced recruitment and poor survival rates, and an understanding of the influence of pathogens is crucial for the management of small populations of primates."

Serological diagnosis is the chosen method to identify T. cruzi infection in dogs that, in Brazil, rarely present positive parasitological tests. The use of recombinant chimeric parasitic antigens results in a sensitive and specific serological diagnostic test in contrast to the use of crude T. cruzi antigens. Our objective was to evaluate the Chagas/Bio-Manguinhos Lateral Flow Immunochromatographic Rapid Test (Chagas-LFRT) for the diagnosis of T. cruzi infection in domestic dogs and the potential of application of this diagnostic platform to wild canid species. Two recombinant proteins (IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4) that displayed the best performance in the enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) in previous studies were tested in a platform with two diagnostic bands. A panel of 281 dog serum samples was evaluated: 133 positive for T. cruzi by serological diagnosis, including 20 samples with positive blood cultures belonging to different discrete typing units (DTUs); 129 negative samples; and 19 samples from dogs infected by other trypanosomatids: Leishmania infantum, Trypanosoma rangeli, Trypanosoma caninum and Crithidia mellificae, in addition to samples infected by Anaplasma platys, Dirofilaria immitis and Erlichia sp. that were employed to evaluate eventual cross-reactions. We also evaluated the Chagas-LFRT to detect T. cruzi infection in 9 serum samples from six wild canid species. We observed that the intensity pattern of the bands was directly proportional to the serological titer observed in IFAT. The sensitivity was 94%, the specificity was 91% according to the ROC curve, and the defined cutoff was an optical density of 4.8. The agreement obtained was considered substantial by the kappa analysis (84%). From T. cruzi positive hemoculture samples, 88.9% were positive by Chagas-LFRT. The test was efficient in recognizing infections by five of the six T. cruzi DTUs. Cross-reactions were not observed in infections by L. infantum, T. rangeli, T. caninum and D. immitis; however, they were observed in sera of dogs infected by Crithidia mellificae, Anaplasma sp. and Erlichia sp. A strong reaction was observed when serum samples from wild canids were submitted to the Protein A affinity test, confirming its applicability for these species. This test will allow rapid preventive actions in areas with high risk to the emergence of Chagas disease in a safer, reliable, low-cost and immediate manner, without the need for more complex laboratory tests."

The blood samples and biometric data were collected from 40 opossums captured by Tomahawk and Sherman traps in six urban forest fragments located in the city. The health of these animals was inferred, mainly, by means of blood parameters (PCV, RBC, WBC, MCV and WBC differential). Molecular detection of T. cruzi infection was performed by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR), using 18S and 24S alpha rDNA region as target. Paired-t-test and simple linear regression were used for statistical analysis. No significant difference was observed between the averages of hematological variables in relation to gender and body condition. The molecular diagnosis showed that 32.5% (13/40) of the opossums were infected by T. cruzi, which presented lymphocytosis (3.4 +/- 1.5) and eosinophilia (0.09 +/- 0.13). Path analysis showed that T. cruzi infection resulted in increased numbers of lymphocytes and indirectly decreased the body condition of opossums. Moreover T. cruzi infection resulted in a direct effect on decrease of MCV. Overall, our results suggest that T. cruzi infection may represent a risk to health of opossums since the lyrnphocytosis may cause a secondary damage on body condition of infected animals."

Both the vector species and the genetic lineages of T. cruzi present a varied geographical distribution. This study aimed to verify the influence of sympatry in the interaction of T. cruzi with triatomines. Methods: The behavior of the strains PR2256 (T. cruzi II) and AM14 (T. cruzi IV) was studied in Triatoma sordida (TS) and Rhodnius robustus (RR). Eleven fifth-stage nymphs were fed by artificial xenodiagnosis with 5.6 x 10(3) blood trypomastigotes/0.1mL of each T. cruzi strain. Every 20 days, their excreta were examined for up to 100 days, and every 30 days, the intestinal content was examined for up to 120 days, by parasitological (fresh examination and differential count with Giemsa-stained smears) and molecular (PCR) methods. Rates of infectivity, metacyclogenesis and mortality, and mean number of parasites per insect and of excreted parasites were determined. Results: Sympatric groups RR+AM14 and TS+PR2256 showed higher values of the four parameters, except for mortality rate, which was higher (27.3%) in the TS+AM14 group. General infectivity was 72.7%, which was mainly proven by PCR, showing the following decreasing order: RR+AM14 (100%), TS+PR2256 (81.8%), RR+PR2256 (72.7%) and TS+AM14 (36.4%). Conclusions: Our working hypothesis was confirmed once higher infectivity and vector capacity (flagellate production and elimination of infective metacyclic forms) were recorded in the groups that contained sympatric T. cruzi lineages and triatomine species."

It is currently represented by six genetic lineages (Discrete Typing Units, DTUs) designated Tcl-TcVI. Tcl is the most geographically widespread and genetically heterogeneous lineage, this as is evidenced by a wide range of genetic markers applied to isolates spanning a vast geographic range in Latin America. Methodology/Principal findings In total, 78 Tcl isolated from hosts and vectors distributed in 5 different biomes of Brazil, were analyzed using 6 nuclear housekeeping genes, 25 microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial marker. Nuclear markers reveal substantial genetic diversity, significant gene flow between biomes, incongruence in phylogenies, and haplotypic analysis indicative of intra-DTU genetic exchange. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on mitochondrial and nuclear loci were incongruent, and consistent with introgression. Structure analysis of microsatellite data reveals that, amongst biomes, the Amazon is the most genetically diverse and experiences the lowest level of gene flow. Investigation of population structure based on the host species/genus, indicated that Didelphis marsupialis might play a role as the main disperser of Tcl. Conclusions/Significance The present work considers a large Tcl sample from different hosts and vectors spanning multiple ecologically diverse biomes in Brazil. Importantly, we combine fast and slow evolving markers to contribute to the epizootiological understanding of Tcl in five distinct Brazilian biomes. This constitutes the first instance in which MLST analysis was combined with the use of MLMT and maxicircle markers to evaluate the genetic diversity of Tcl isolates in Brazil. Our results demonstrate the existence of substantial genetic diversity and the occurrence of introgression events. We provide evidence of genetic exchange in Tcl isolates from Brazil and of the relative isolation of Tcl in the Amazon biome. We observe the absence of strict associations with Tcl genotypes to geographic areas and/or host species."

We characterized the lipid profiles of each unit of the T. infestans salivary gland. We noticed that LPC is present in the three units of the salivary gland and that the insect feeding state does not influence its proportion. 7'. infestans saliva and LPC can enhance T. cruzi transmission to mice by dramatically altering the profile of inflammatory cells at the site of inoculation on mouse skin, facilitating the transmission of T. cruzi to the vertebrate host.

However, placental transmission occurs in only 5% of infected mothers and it has been proposed that the epithelial turnover of the trophoblast can be considered a local placental defense against the parasite. Thus, Trypanosoma cruzi induces cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptotic cell death in the trophoblast, which are regulated, among other mechanisms, by small non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs. On the other hand, ex vivo infection of human placental explants induces a specific microRNA profile that includes microRNAs related to trophoblast differentiation such as miR-512-3p miR-515-5p, codified at the chromosome 19 microRNA cluster. Here we determined the expression validated target genes of miR-512-3p and miR-515-5p, specifically human glial cells missing 1 transcription factor and cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein, as well as the expression of the main trophoblast differentiation marker human chorionic gonadotrophin during ex vivo infection of human placental explants, and examined how the inhibition or overexpression of both microRNAs affects parasite infection. We conclude that Trypanosoma cruzi-induced trophoblast epithelial turnover, particularly trophoblast differentiation, is at least partially mediated by placenta-specific miR-512-3p and miR-515-5p and that both miRNAs mediate placental susceptibility to ex vivo infection of human placental explants.

The aim of this study was to evaluate epidemiological aspects of ChD in the state of Pi-auí located in northeastern Brazil. This is an analytical cross-sectional study carried out from the collection of data of the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN, in Portuguese, Sistema de Informações de Agravos de Notificação) of suspected and confirmed cases of acute ChD in the state of Piauí, in the period 2010–2019. Associations between T. cruzi positivity and the study variables were determined by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and were raised as prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence interval. According to this survey, 517 suspected cases of acute ChD were reported in Piauí, with 70 cases (13.5%) confirmed. In 88.5% of confirmed cases, confirmation occurred by laboratory diagnosis. Most of the confirmed cases occurred in municipalities located in the semiarid region, with the municipality of São João do Piauí presenting the highest number of cases. Regarding sociodemographic data, females represent 55.7% of cases, people over 50 years of age (55.7%), being three cases in people up to 18 years of age, and less than 8 years of schooling (67.1%). 77.9% of confirmed cases had vector transmission as the probable form of infection. The data available in this study conclude that vectorial transmission of ChD in the state of Piauí remains active. This fact is corroborated by the number of notified and confirmed cases of acute ChD, requiring housing improvement programs and more effective epidemiological surveillance to control the transmission of the disease in the state. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

Previously, we demonstrated increased cardiac lipid accumulation and endoplasmic reticulum stress in mice with CCM. Increased endoplasmic reticulum stress may lead to uncontrolled SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) activation and lipotoxicity in the myocardium during the intermediate stage of infection and result in progression to chronic CCM. Therefore, we investigated whether inhibiting SREBP activation modulates CCM progression in T cruzi-infected mice. Methods and Results T cruzi-infected cultured cardiomyocytes (3:1 multiplicity of infection; 24 hours postinfection) were incubated with betulin (3 mu mol/L per mL), an SREBP inhibitor, for 24 hours. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analyses demonstrated a significant reduction in SREBP activation, lipid biosynthesis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in betulin-treated infected cells compared with untreated cells. T cruzi infected (10(3) trypomastigotes of the Brazil strain) Swiss mice were fed a customized diet containing betulin during the intermediate stage (40 days postinfection) until the chronic stage (120 DPI). Cardiac ultrasound imaging and histological and biochemical analyses demonstrated anatomical and functional improvements in betulin-treated, infected mice compared with untreated controls: we observed a significant reduction in cholesterol/fatty acid synthesis that may result in the observed cardiac reduction in cardiac lipid accumulation, mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and ventricular enlargement. Conclusions Our study (in vitro and vivo) demonstrates that inhibition of cardiac SREBP activation reduces cardiac damage during T cruzi infection and modulates CCM in a murine Chagas model."

Currently, it is the species most frequently captured by the Chagas Disease Control Program in Brazil. For this reason, population genetic studies attract great interest, as they can provide further information about the dispersal and household invasion processes of this species. In the absence of suitable markers, the objective of this study was to test the cross amplification of microsatellite primers. Findings: 23 primers were tested for microsatellite loci already described for other species of the genus Triatoma sp. Forty four specimens of T. sordida captured in the north of Minas Gerais were used to validate the use of standardized loci for population genetic analyses. It was possible to amplify 10 of the 23 loci tested for T. sordida. Conclusions: This is the first study that provides 10 microsatellite markers for population analysis of this triatomine species. Cross-amplification of primers can be used among other phylogenetically related species whose loci are already available for study."

Unlike most mammals, coatis construct arboreal nests used for resting and reproduction. In this region, the coati is an important host of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. There are two possible routes through coatis can be infected by T. cruzi: the oral route or the vectorial route. However, the relative importance of each of these routes in the infection of coatis and its role in the sylvatic cycle of the parasite are unknown. Our objectives were to investigate: (i) whether coati nests were infested by triatomine bugs, (ii) what species were frequent in the nests, (iii) whether the triatomines in nests were infected by T. cruzi, and (iv) what were the food resources of these triatomines. Eight of the 24 nests sampled were infested with triatomines, a total of 37 specimens of at least two species (Rhodnius stali and Triatoma sordida). In one nest, R. stali and T. sordida co-occurred and both fed on multiple resources, including coatis. This is the first report of triatomines occurring in arboreal nests of coatis. The co-occurrence of two different genera of triatomine vectors and coatis within the limited space of the coati nests provide multiple opportunities for the exchange of the protozoan parasite through both the vectorial and oral transmission routes."

The reasons that some patients develop different clinical forms or remain asymptomatic are unclear. It is believed that tissue immunogenetic markers influence the tropism of T. cruzi for different organs. ABO, Secretor and Lewis histo-blood group systems express a variety of tissue carbohydrate antigens that influence the susceptibility or resistance to diseases. This study aimed to examine the association of ABO, secretor and Lewis histo-blood systems with the clinical forms of Chagas disease. We enrolled 339 consecutive adult patients with chronic Chagas disease regardless of gender (cardiomyopathy: n = 154; megaesophagus: n = 119; megacolon: n = 66). The control group was composed by 488 healthy blood donors. IgG anti-T. cruzi antibodies were detected by ELISA. ABO and Lewis phenotypes were defined by standard hemagglutination tests. Secretor (FUT2) and Lewis (FUT3) genotypes, determined by Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), were used to infer the correct histo-blood group antigens expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. The proportions between groups were compared using the chi(2) test with Yates correction and Fisher's exact test and the Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) were calculated. An alpha error of 5% was considered significant with p-values <0.05 being corrected for multiple comparisons (pc). No statistically significant differences were found for the ABO (X-2: 2.635; p-value = 0.451), Secretor (X-2: 0.056; p-value = 0.812) or Lewis (X-2: 2.092; p-value = 0.351) histo-blood group phenotypes between patients and controls.

In the present study, we evaluated the limit of detection of polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR/RFLP) analysis of cytochrome oxidase II (COII) for the identification of genetic groups of these two parasites in blood and tissue from vertebrate hosts. Reconstitution experiments were performed using human blood (TcI/TcII and KP1+/KP1-) and mouse tissue (TcI/TcII). We tested blood from patients who were in the chronic phase of Chagas disease and tissue from animals that were experimentally infected with all possible combinations of six discrete typing units. In blood samples, T. cruzi and T. rangeli were detected when 5 parasites (pa) were present in the sample, and genetic groups were identified when at least 50 pa were present in the sample. T. cruzi alone could be detected with 1 pa and genotyped (TcI/TcII) with 2 pa. T. rangeli was detected with 2 pa and genotyped (KP+/KP1-) with 25 pa. The present method more readily detected TcII and KP1- in both admixtures and alone. In mouse tissue, TcI and TcII were detected with at least 25 pa. The analysis of blood samples from patients and tissue from animals that were experimentally infected revealed low parasite loads in these hosts, which were below the limit of detection of the present method and could not be genotyped. Our findings indicate that the performance of PCR/RFLP analysis of COII is directly related to the amount and proportion of parasites that are present in the sample and the genetic groups to which the parasites belong."

However, there are multiple reports of T. cruzi transmission involving secondary vectors. In this work, we carried out an eco-epidemiological study on Margarita Island, located in the Caribbean region of Colombia, where Chagas disease is associated with non-domiciliated vectors. Methods: To understand the transmission dynamics of Trypanosoma cruzi in this area, we designed a comprehensive, multi-faceted study including the following: (i) entomological evaluation through a community-based insect-surveillance campaign, blood meal source determination and T. cruzi infection rate estimation in triatomine insects; (ii) serological determination of T. cruzi prevalence in children under 15 years old, as well as in domestic dogs and synanthropic mammals; (iii) evaluation of T. cruzi transmission capacity in dogs and Didelphis marsupialis, and (iv) genetic characterization of T. cruzi isolates targeting spliced-leader intergene region (SL-IR) genotypes. Results: Out of the 124 triatomines collected, 94 % were Triatoma maculata, and 71.6 % of them were infected with T. cruzi. Blood-meal source analysis showed that T. maculata feeds on multiple hosts, including humans and domestic dogs. Serological analysis indicated 2 of 803 children were infected, representing a prevalence of 0.25 %. The prevalence in domestic dogs was 71.6 % (171/224). Domestic dogs might not be competent reservoir hosts, as inferred from negative T. cruzi xenodiagnosis and haemoculture tests. However, 61.5 % (8/13) of D. marsupialis, the most abundant synanthropic mammal captured, were T. cruzi-positive on xenodiagnosis and haemocultures. Conclusions: This study reveals the role of peridomestic T. maculata and dogs in T. cruzi persistence in this region and presents evidence that D. marsupialis are a reservoir mediating peridomestic-zoonotic cycles. This picture reflects the complexity of the transmission dynamics of T. cruzi in an endemic area with non-domiciliated vectors where active human infection exists. There is an ongoing need to control peridomestic T. maculata populations and to implement continuous reservoir surveillance strategies with community participation."

Wild-type (WT) and OPN-deficient (sppl -/-) mice were parasite-infected (Brazil strain) for 100 days. Both groups developed chronic myocarditis with similar parasite burden and survival rates. However, sppl -/- infection showed lower heart-to-body ratio (P < 0.01) as well as reduced inflammatory pathology (P < 0.05), CCL5 expression (P < 0.05), myocyte size (P < 0.05) and fibrosis (P < 0.01) in cardiac tissues. Intense OPN labeling was observed in inflammatory cells recruited to infected heart (P < 0.05). Plasma concentration of MMP-2 was higher (P < 0.05) in infected WT than in sppl -/- mice. Coincidently, specific immunostaining revealed increased gelatinase expression (P < 0.01) and activity (P < 0.05) in the inflamed hearts from T. cruzi WT mice, but not in their sppl -/- littermates. CCL5 and MMP-2 induction occurred preferentially (P < 0.01) in WT heart-invading CDS+ T cells and was mediated via phospho-JNK MAPK signaling.

Subsequently, infection of dogs was determined by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the detection of IgM and IgG isotypes and Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) reactions for detection of IgG. Triatomine infection was determined by PCR. Forty (16/40) percent of the dogs were seropositive for T. cruzi; 20.0% (8/40) of such reactivity indicated the acute phase, and 20.0% (8/40), the chronic phase.

Triatomines evaluation showed 82.5% (94/114) of PCR positivity. Taken together, our results confirm that dogs are domestic reservoirs of T. cruzi in northeastern Brazil and T. brasiliensis is the main triatomine species correlated with parasite transmission in domiciliary environments.

The most important treatment options are nitroimidazole derivatives, such as nifurtimox and benznidazole (BZN). Some studies suggest that for adults seropositive toT.cruzibut without clinically evident chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), a simple fixed-dose scheme of BZN could be equivalent to a weight-adjusted dose. We compared the efficacy and safety of a fixed dose of BZN with an adjusted dose forT.cruziseropositive adults without CCC. We used the Cochrane methods, and reported according to the PRISMA statement. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) allocating participants to fixed and/or adjusted doses of BZN forT.cruziseropositive adults without CCC. We searched (December 2019) Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and contacted Chagas experts. Selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment, using the Cochrane tool, were performed independently by pairs of reviewers. Discrepancies were solved by consensus within the team. Primary outcomes were parasite-related outcomes and efficacy or patient-related safety outcomes. We conducted a meta-analysis using RevMan 5.3 software and used GRADE summary of finding tables to present the certainty of evidence by outcome. We identified 655 records through our search strategy and 10 studies (four of them ongoing) met our inclusion criteria. We did not find any study directly comparing fixed vs adjusted doses of BZN, however, some outcomes allowed subgroup comparisons between fixed and adjusted doses of BZN against placebo. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests no important subgroup differences for positive PCR at one year and for three safety outcomes (drug discontinuation, peripheral neuropathy, and mild rash). The same effect was observed for any serious adverse events (low-certainty evidence). All subgroups showed similar effects (I(2)0% for all these subgroup comparisons but 32% for peripheral neuropathy), supporting the equivalence of BZN schemes. We conclude that there is no direct evidence comparing fixed and adjusted doses of BZN. Based on low to very low certainty of evidence for critical clinical outcomes and moderate certainty of evidence for important outcomes, fixed and adjusted doses may be equivalent in terms of safety and efficacy. An individual patient data network meta-analysis could better address this issue. Author summary Chagas disease is a major public health problem that requires, among other control interventions, an optimal trypanocidal therapy that achieves the best possible compliance to cure active infection, mainly in children and young populations, women before they become pregnant to prevent congenital transmission, and chronic populations who are currently not being treated and with a risk of progression to cardiomyopathy. Some studies suggest that a simple fixed-dose scheme of benznidazole could be equivalent to the dose adjusted by weight for the treatment of adults seropositive toT.cruziwithout clinically evident chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. To confirm or reject this potential equivalence of schemes, we conducted a rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials by reviewing and analyzing the totality of available literature on the subject. Although we did not find direct evidence addressing this question, it appears that an adjusted dose is probably equivalent in terms of important safety and efficacy outcomes, while the effect on critical outcomes is uncertain. Since we did not find any ongoing study comparing fixed versus adjusted doses of benznidazole, we are conducting an individual patient data network meta-analysis to address this question."

In this sense, the present study evaluated the impact of oral infection on the digestive tract in mice infected by Berenice-78 (Be-78) T. cruzi strain, in comparison with the intraperitoneal route of infection. In this work, the intraperitoneal route group showed a peak of parasitemia similar to the oral route group, however the mortality rate among the orally infected animals was higher when compared to intraperitoneal route. By analyzing the frequency of blood cell populations, differences were mainly observed in CD4(+) T lymphocytes, and not in CD8(+)' presenting an earlier reduction in the number of CD4(+) T cells, which persisted for a longer period, in the animals of the oral group when compared with the intraperitoneal group. Animals infected by oral route presented a higher tissue parasitism and inflammatory infiltrate in stomach, duodenum and colon on the 28th day after infection. Therefore, these data suggest that oral infection has a different profile of parasitological and immune responses compared to intraperitoneal route, being the oral mute more virulent and with greater tissue parasitism in organs of the gastrointestinal tract evaluated during the acute phase."

In endemic areas (South and Central America), Chagas disease represents a relevant public health issue, and is the most frequent cause of cardiomyopathy. In nonendemic areas, such as Europe, Chagas disease represents an emerging problem following the establishment of sizeable communities from Brazil and Bolivia. Chagas cardiomyopathy represents the most frequent and serious complication of chronic Chagas disease, affecting about 20-30% of patients, potentially leading to heart failure, arrhythmias, thromboembolism, stroke and sudden death. Because late complications of Chagas disease may develop several years or even decades after the acute infection, it may be extremely challenging to reach the correct diagnosis in patients long removed from the countries of origin. We report two examples of Chagas cardiomyopathy in South American women permanently residing in Italy for more than 20 years, presenting with cardiac manifestations ranging from left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure to isolated ventricular arrhythmias. The present review emphasizes that Chagas disease should be considered as a potential diagnosis in patients from endemic areas presenting with idiopathic' cardiac manifestations, even when long removed from their country of origin, with potential implications for treatment and control of Chagas disease transmission."

Pathogenicity of Triatoma virus has been demonstrated in laboratory; accidental infections in insectaries produce high insect mortality. When more than one microorganism enters the same host, the biological interaction among them differs greatly depending on the nature and the infection order of the co-existing species of microorganisms. We studied the possible interactions between Triatoma virus (TrV) and Trypanosoma cruzi (the etiological agent of Chagas disease) in three different situations: (i) when Triatoma virus is inoculated into an insect host (Triatoma infestans) previously infected with T. cruzi, (ii) when T. cruzi is inoculated into T. infestans previously infected with TrV, and (iii) when TrV and T. cruzi are inoculated simultaneously into the same T. infestans individual. Trypanosoma cruzi infection was found in 57% of insects in the control group for T. cruzi, whereas 85% of insects with previous TrV infection were infected with T. cruzi. TrV infection was found in 78.7% of insects in the control group for TrV, whereas insects previously infected with T. cruzi showed 90% infection with TrV. A total of 67.9% of insects presented simultaneous infection with both types of microorganism. Our results suggest that TrV infection could increase adhesion of T. cruzi to the intestinal cells of triatomines, but presence of T. cruzi in intestinal cells would not increase the possibility of entry of TrV into cells. Although this study cannot explain the mechanism through which TrV facilitates the infection of triatomines with T. cruzi, we conclude that after TrV replication, changes at cellular level should occur that increase the adhesion of T. cruzi."

Risk factors and the presence of T. cruzi antibodies in at-risk Dutch blood donors were studied to assess whether specific blood safety measures are warranted in the Netherlands. Methodology Birth in a country endemic for Chagas disease (CEC), having a mother born in a CEC, or having resided for at least six continuous months in a CEC were considered risk factors for T. cruzi infection. From March through September 2013, risk factor questions were asked to all donors who volunteered to donate blood or blood components. Serum samples were collected from donors reporting one or more risk factors, and screened for IgG antibodies to T. cruzi by EIA. Results Risk factors for T. cruzi infection were reported by 1,426 of 227,278 donors (0.6%). Testing 1,333 at-risk donors, none (0.0%; 95%, CI 0.0-0.4%) was seroreactive for IgG antibodies to T. cruzi. A total of 472 donors were born in a CEC; 553 donors reported their mother being born in a CEC; and 1,121 donors reported a long-term stay in a CEC. The vast majority of reported risk factors were related to Suriname and Brazil. Overall, the participants resided for 7,694 years in CECs, which equals 2.8 million overnight stays. Of those, 1.9 million nights were spent in Suriname. Conclusions/Significance Asymptomatic T. cruzi infection appears to be extremely rare among Dutch blood donors.

Vector control has for decades relied upon insecticide spraying, but insecticide resistance has recently emerged in several triatomine populations. One alternative strategy to reduce T. cruzi transmission is paratransgenesis, whereby symbiotic bacteria are genetically engineered to produce T. cruzi-killing proteins in the vector's gut. This approach requires in-depth knowledge of the vectors' natural gut microbiota. Here, we use metagenomics (16S rRNA 454 pyrosequencing) to describe the gut microbiota of field-caught Triatoma sordida +/- likely the most common peridomestic triatomine in Brazil. For large nymphs (4 th and 5 th stage) and adults, we also studied separately the three main digestive-tract segments-anterior midgut, posterior midgut, and hindgut. Principal findings Bacteria of four phyla (12 genera) were present in both nymphs (all five stages) and adults, thus defining T. sordida's 'bacterial core': Actinobacteria (Brevibacterium, Corynebacterium, Dietzia, Gordonia, Nitriliruptor, Nocardia, Nocardiopsis, Rhodococcus, and Williamsia), Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas and Sphingobium), and Firmicutes (Staphylococcus). We found some clear differences in bacterial composition and relative abundance among development stages; overall, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria increased, but Actinobacteria decreased, through development. Finally, the bacterial microbiotas of the bugs' anterior midgut, posterior midgut, and hindgut were sharply distinct. Conclusions/Significance Our results identify the 'bacterial core set' of T. sordida and reveal important gut microbiota differences among development stages-particularly between 1st-3rd stage nymphs and adults. Further, we show that, within any given development stage, the vectors' gut cannot be regarded as a single homogeneous environment. Cultivable, non-pathogenic 'core' bacterial species may now be tested as candidates for paratransgenic control of T. cruzi transmission by T. sordida."

The importance of this species in Minas Gerais has been recognized since the 80s. It is responsible for the high prevalence rates of Chagas disease in the west of the state. Studies conducted in the municipality of Jaboticatubas show that P. megistus is still the most captured vector in the region, even after 40 years of uninterrupted actions of the Chagas Disease Control Program in the municipality. Despite the importance of the species, its population dynamics is little studied. Consequently, crucial genetic information such as genetic diversity and gene flow among environments have not been well characterized yet. In this context, this work presents a population genetic analysis at the microgeographic level using microsatellite markers in samples of P. megistus obtained from Jaboticatubas to better understand the infestation dynamics of the primary vector species of T. cruzi in the region. The observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.26 to 0.47 and 0.47 to 0.65, respectively. Most loci presented Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium due to the excess of homozygotes. The pairwise Fst ranged from 0.05 to 0.35, with the p value significant for all comparisons, indicating the absence of gene flow between them. The values of Fis found ranged from 0.25 to 0.52, all values of p <= 0.05, probably due to structured populations, inbreeding, or null alleles. The results suggest an extended stay of this species in the colonized environments, with rare dispersal to other locations. Such results differ from that observed for Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma dimidiata, species that present constant movement, even after colonization of the artificial environment, and are similar to the behavior of Triatoma infestans. Thus, the study reinforces the importance of continuous entomological surveillance in the areas of occurrence of P. megistus to avoid the installation and formation of new foci of household infestation in the region."

RID mice and non-transgenic mice (wild type, WT) were infected with blood trypomastigotes of Brazil strain. During the acute stage of infection, RID mice had lower parasitemia, lower heart inflammation, and a decrease in the relative distribution of parasite load from cardiac muscle tissue toward epididymal fat. Nevertheless, comparable profiles of myocardial inflammatory infiltrates and relative distribution of parasite load were observed among RID and WT at the chronic stage of infection. Aif1(-/-) and Aif1(+/+) mice were infected with bloodstream trypomastigotes of Tulahuen strain and fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or regular diet (RD). Interestingly, Aif1(+/+) HFD infected mice showed the highest mortality. Swiss mice infected with blood trypomastigotes of Berenice-78 strain on a HFD had higher levels of TNF alpha and more inflammation in their heart tissue than infected mice fed a RD. These various murine models implicate adipocytes in the pathogenesis of chronic Chagas disease and suggest that HFD can lead to a significant increase in the severity of parasite-induced chronic cardiac damage.

Despite being responsible for more than 12 thousand deaths per year, the disease disposes basically of two drugs for its treatment, the nitroimidazole benznidazole and the nitrofuran nifurtimox. However, these drugs have innumerous limitations that greatly reduce the chances of cure. In Brazil, for example, only benznidazole is available to treat CD patients. Therefore, some proof-of-concept phase II clinical trials focused on improving the current treatment with benznidazole, also comparing it with repositioned drugs or combining them. Indeed, repositioning already marketed drugs in view of combating neglected tropical diseases is a very interesting approach in the context of decreased time for approval, better treatment options and low cost for development and implementation. After the introduction of human immunodeficiency virus aspartyl peptidase inhibitors (HIV-PIs) in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the prevalence and incidence of parasitic, fungal and bacterial co-infections suffered a marked reduction, making these HIV-PIs attractive for drug repositioning. In this line, the present perspective presents the promising and beneficial data concerning the effects of HIV-PIs on the clinically relevant forms of Trypanosoma cruzi (i.e., trypomastigotes and amastigotes) and also highlights the ultrastructural and physiological targets for the HIV-PIs on this parasite.

Vector transmission is one of the most important routes in South and Central American countries. Between 2013 and 2019, municipalities of Sergipe sent 507 triatomines for analysis, unveiling the largest records found in the south in the villages of Poço da Clara, Alagoinhas and Pilões, and the municipality of Tobias Barreto. The high prevalence of infected vectors in these localities motivated this epidemiological study. Methods: After educational lectures on the vectors and risks of the disease, a structured questionnaire was administered to identify areas and risk factors for transmission of the parasite. The data guided the collection of vectors and blood samples from domestic reservoirs. Results: The studied region is considered endemic for triatomines infected by Trypanosoma cruzi with three species of vectors; the highest prevalence was Panstrongylus lutzi (54.83%), followed by Triatoma pseudomaculata (43.54%), and Triatoma tibiamaculata (1.61%). In the villages in this study, 100% of the vectors were found intradomically. The coexistence of residents with domestic animals was reported by 62.04% (255) of those surveyed. Forty-one small animals that were actively living with humans at home in the localities were evaluated serologically. No infection was observed in the domestic animals.

We evaluated the efficacy of BZ treatment in Swiss mice that were inoculated with T. cruzi IV strains from the Western Brazilian Amazon. The mice were orally (OR) or intraperitoneally (IP) inoculated with 2 x 10(6) culture-derived metacyclic trypomastigotes of the AM14, AM16, AM64, and AM69 strains of T. cruzi that were obtained from two outbreaks of orally acquired acute Chagas disease in the state of Amazonas, Brazil.

Fresh blood examination, hemoculture, conventional and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to monitor the therapeutic effects of BZ. Significant reductions in five of 24 parameters of parasitemia and parasite load were found in different tissues in the OR group, indicating worse response to BZ treatment compared with the IP group, in which significant reductions in nine of those 24 parameters were observed.

The feasibility of the management of Chagas disease at primary healthcare clinics using a biomedical and psychosocial interdisciplinary approach was also tested. Previously, a Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) infection rate of 4.4% among 633 immigrants was reported. The samples were screened using two commercial enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) tests generated with epimastigote antigens, and those with discrepant or seropositive results were analyzed by confirmatory tests: indirect immunofluorescence (IFI), TESA-blot and a commercial recombinant ELISA. PCR and blood cultures were performed in seropositive patients. Results The majority of the 28 seropositive patients were women, of whom 88.89% were of childbearing age. The predominant clinical forms of Chagas disease were the indeterminate and atypical cardiac forms. Less than 50% received the recommended antiparasitic treatment of benznidazole. An interdisciplinary team was centered on primary healthcare physicians who applied guidelines for the management of patients. Infectologists, cardiologists, pediatricians and other specialists acted as reference professionals. Confirmatory serology and molecular biology tests, as well as echocardiography, Holter and other tests, were performed for the assessment of affected organs in secondary healthcare centers. The published high performance of two commercial ELISA tests was not confirmed. Conclusion An interdisciplinary approach including antiparasitic treatment is feasible at the primary healthcare level for the management of Chagas disease in Bolivian immigrants. The itinerant feature of immigration was associated with a lack of adherence to antiparasitic treatment and was considered a main challenge for the clinical management of this population. This approach is recommended for management of the infected population in endemic and nonendemic areas, although different strategies are needed depending on the severity of the disease and the structure of the healthcare system."

A total of 2,967 individuals from Colombia, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil, were included in this study. The individuals were classified as seronegative and seropositive for T. cruzi antigens, and this last group were divided into asymptomatic and CCC. For T. cruzi infection susceptibility, the IL17A rs2275913*A showed a significant association in a fixed-effect meta-analysis after a Bonferroni correction (P = 0.016, OR = 1.21, 95%CI = 1.06-1.41). No evidence of association was detected when comparing CCC vs. asymptomatic patients. However, when CCC were compared with seronegative individuals, it showed a nominal association in the meta-analysis (P.= 0.040, OR = 1.20, 95%CI = 1.01-1.45). For the IL17A rs4711998 and rs8193036, no association was observed.

The trophoblast constitutes the first tissue in contact with the maternal-blood circulating parasite. Importantly, the congenital transmission rates are low, suggesting the presence of local placental defense mechanisms. On the other hand, the placenta is considered an immune regulatory organ since it acts as a modulator of fetal and maternal immune responses. We have previously proposed that local placental factors, such as the epithelial turnover of the trophoblast and the innate immune response initiated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), might prevent parasite infection and congenital transmission. Here, we studied in an ex vivo infected human placental chorionic villi explant HPCVE model, the relationship between TLR-2 activation in response to T. cruzi trypomastigotes, the secreted profile of cytokines, the integrity of the placental barrier and the expression of trophoblast turnover markers. Results: TLR-2 inhibition increases the parasite induced histopathological damage, prevents secretion of IL-6 and IL-10, decreases expression of PCNA (proliferation marker) and of beta-hCG (differentiation marker) while increasing caspase 3 activity (cell death marker). Conclusion: Our results suggest that TLR-2 is not only involved in the local secretion of cytokines but also regulates, at least partially, the trophoblast turnover. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the spatial distribution of T. cruzi vectors and how climatic and landscape combined variables explain the distribution are still poorly understood. The goal of this study was to predict the potential distribution of T. cruzi vectors as a proxy for Chagas disease transmission risk using Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) based on climatic and landscape variables. We hypothesize that ENM based on both climate and landscape variables are more powerful than climate-only or landscape-only models, and that this will be true independent of vector species. A total of 2,662 records of triatomines of five species were obtained by community-based entomological surveillance from 2007 to 2013. The species with the highest number of specimens was Panstrongylus megistus (73%; n = 1,943), followed by Panstrongylus geniculatus (15.4%; 411), Rhodnius neglectus (6.0%; 159), Triatoma sordida (4.5%; 119) and Rhodnius prolixus (1.1%; 30). Of the total, 71.9% were captured at the intradomicile. T. cruzi infection was observed in 19.7% of the 2,472 examined insects. ENMs were generated based on selected climate and landscape variables with 1 km(2) spatial resolution. Zonal statistics were used for classifying the municipalities as to the risk of occurrence of synanthropic triatomines. The integrated analysis of the climate and landscape suitability on triatomines geographical distribution was powerful on generating good predictive models. Moreover, this showed that some municipalities in the northwest, north and northeast of the Parana state have a higher risk of T. cruzivector transmission. This occurs because those regions present high climatic and landscape suitability values for occurrence of their vectors. The frequent invasion of houses by infected triatomines clearly indicates a greater risk of transmission of T. cruzi to the inhabitants. More public health attention should be given in the northern areas of the State of Parana, which presents high climate and landscape suitabilities for the disease vectors. In conclusion, our results through spatial analysis and predictive maps showed to be effective in identifying areas of potential distribution and, consequently, in the definition of strategic areas and actions to prevent new cases of Chagas' disease, reinforcing the need for continuous and robust surveillance in these areas."

Currently the species is divided into six taxonomic groups. The genome of the CL Brener clone has been estimated to be 106.4 +/- 110.7 Mb, and DNA content analyses revealed that it is a diploid hybrid clone. Trypanosoma rangeli is a hemoflagellate that has the same reservoirs and vectors as T. cruzi; however, it is non-pathogenic to vertebrate hosts. The haploid genome of T. rangeli was previously estimated to be 24 Mb. The parasitic strains of T. rangeli are divided into KP1(+) and KP1(-). Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the DNA content in different strains of T. cruzi and T. rangeli by flow cytometry. All T. cruzi and T. rangeli strains yielded cell cycle profiles with clearly identifiable G1-0 (2n) and G2-M (4n) peaks. T. cruzi and T. rangeli genome sizes were estimated using the clone CL Brener and the Leishmania major CC1 as reference cell lines because their genome sequences have been previously determined. The DNA content of T. cruzi strains ranged from 87,41 to 108,16 Mb, and the DNA content of T. rangeli strains ranged from 63,25 Mb to 68,66 Mb. No differences in DNA content were observed between KP1(+) and KP1(-) T. rangeli strains. Cultures containing mixtures of the epimastigote forms of T. cruzi and T. rangeli strains resulted in cell cycle profiles with distinct G1 peaks for strains of each species.

Together with migration to urban areas and increase in life expectancy, a new scenario for Chagas disease has emerged in Brazil with most patients currently elderly individuals living in urban areas. However, acute Chagas disease cases still occur due to vector transmission by sylvatic vectors and oral transmission by contaminated food. Therefore, we characterized the clinical and epidemiological profile of the patients followed at Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We aimed to identify the clinical forms, associated co-morbidities, and geographical areas where younger patients originate from. This will aid in the identification of potential challenges to be currently faced. Results: This is a cross-sectional study. Adult patients with chronic Chagas disease were recruited between March 2013 and April 2016. Clinical and epidemiological data were obtained from electronic medical records and interviews. The clinical form of the Chagas disease presented by the patients was determined following the Brazilian Consensus on Chagas disease. Six hundred and nineteen patients (mean age 60 +/- 12 years; 56.9% women) were included in this study. Patients' clinical forms were classified as follows: indeterminate 29.1%; cardiac 55.4%; digestive 5.5%; and mixed 10.0%. Patients aged over 65 years comprised 38% of the population. Hypertension was present in 347 (56%) patients, dyslipidemia in 261 patients (42%) and diabetes mellitus in 185 patients (30%). There were no differences regarding gender, race, comorbidities frequency or place of origin across Chagas disease clinical forms. Most of the elderly population originated from Bahia, Minas Gerais and Pernambuco states, while most of the younger patients were born in Ceara, Paraiba and Rio de Janeiro states. Conclusions: We described a great proportion of elderly patients in the composition of an urban Brazilian Chagas disease patient cohort with a high prevalence of comorbidities.

Chronic cardiomyopathy is the most significant chronic form due to its association with morbidity and mortality. The last decade has seen increasing evidence that inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are responsible for the generation of inflammatory infiltrate and tissue damage, with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy patients presenting a pro-inflammatory immune response. Although studies have evaluated the role of chemokines in experimental T. cruzi infection, few have addressed their systemic profile, especially for human infection and in aging populations. The present work aimed to use the data from a large population based study of older adults, conducted in an endemic area for Chagas disease, to examine the association between serum levels of cytokines and chemokines, T. cruzi infection and electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality. Methods The present work evaluated serum levels of CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL5, CXCL8, IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF, IL-12 and IL-10 by Flow Cytometric Bead Array assay (CBA) and the results expressed in pg/ml. The baseline survey started in January 1st 1997, with 1284 participants of an aged population-based cohort. Participants signed an informed consent at baseline and at each subsequent visit and authorized death certificate and medical records verification. Results Our results demonstrated that Chagas disease patients had higher serum levels of CXCL9, CXCL10 and IL-1 beta and lower serum levels of CCL5 than non-infected subjects. Moreover, our data demonstrated that CXCL9 and CXCL10 increased in an age-dependent profile in Chagas disease patients. Conclusion Together, this study provided evidences that serum biomarkers increase along the age continuum and may have potential implications for establishing clinical management protocols and therapeutic intervention in Chagas disease patients."

Triatoma guazu and Triatoma williami are phylogenetically very close and occur in sympatry. Morphologic, morphometric, and genetic analyses were performed to discuss the taxonomic status of these species. Morphometric and molecular data do not show diagnostic characteristics between species, whereas their different patterns of connexival spots were considered a phenotypic polymorphism, common in triatomines. These results suggest T. guazu as a junior synonym of T. williami. Therefore, the synonym between these species is formally proposed here. Triatoma guazu Lent and Wygodzinsky and Triatoma williami Galvao, Souza, and Lima (Hemiptera: Triatominae) are found in human dwellings and are potential vectors of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Triatoma guazu was described based solely on a single female specimen, from the municipality of Villarica, Guaira Department, Paraguay, and posteriorly, a male from Barra do Garcas, Mato Grosso, Brazil was described and designated as the allotype of this species. Triatoma williami is found in the central-west of Brazil between Goias, Mato Grosso, and Mato Grosso do Sul. However, the taxonomic ""status"" of these species is questioned. Previous studies indicate the lack of isoenzymatic diagnostic loci, morphometric similarity, low genetic divergence, and close evolutionary relationship of these species. In this study, we compared the morphology, morphometry, and mitochondrial DNA fragments of the populations of the two species. The morphological diagnostic characteristic among these species is the difference in the connexivum spots pattern, which has been recognized as a phenotypic variation that exists among populations resulting from ecological diversity. Furthermore, our analysis also revealed the morphometric similarity and low genetic divergence between these species.

The infection is transmitted vertically and by blood/organ donation and can reactivate with immunosuppression. Case identification requires awareness and screening programmes targeting the population at risk (women in reproductive age, donors, immunocompromised patients). Treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox is most effective in the acute phase and prevents progression to chronic phase when given to children. Treating women antenatally reduces but does not eliminate vertical transmission. Treatment is poorly tolerated, contraindicated during pregnancy, and has little effect modifying the disease in the chronic phase. Screening is easily performed with serology. Migration has brought the disease outside of the endemic countries, where the transmission continues vertically and via blood and tissue/organ donations. There are more than 32 million migrants from Latin America living in non-endemic countries. However, the infection is massively underdiagnosed in this setting due to the lack of awareness by patients, health authorities and professionals. Blood and tissue donation screening policies have significantly reduced transmission in endemic countries but are not universally established in the non-endemic setting. Antenatal screening is not commonly done. Other challenges include difficulties accessing and retaining patients in the healthcare system and lack of specific funding for the interventions. Any strategy must be accompanied by education and awareness campaigns directed to patients, professionals and policy makers. The involvement of patients and their communities is central and key for success and must be sought early and actively. This review proposes strategies to address challenges faced by non-endemic countries."

Among different factors, the specific recognition of glycan structures by glycan-binding proteins from the parasite or from the mammalian host cells may play a critical role in the evolution of the infection. Methodology and Principal Findings Here we investigated the contribution of galectin-1 (Gal-1), an endogenous glycan-binding protein abundantly expressed in human and mouse heart, to the pathophysiology of T. cruzi infection, particularly in the context of cardiac pathology. We found that exposure of HL-1 cardiac cells to Gal-1 reduced the percentage of infection by two different T. cruzi strains, Tulahuen (TcVI) and Brazil (TcI). In addition, Gal-1 prevented exposure of phosphatidylserine and early events in the apoptotic program by parasite infection on HL-1 cells. These effects were not mediated by direct interaction with the parasite surface, suggesting that Gal-1 may act through binding to host cells. Moreover, we also observed that T. cruzi infection altered the glycophenotype of cardiac cells, reducing binding of exogenous Gal-1 to the cell surface. Consistent with these data, Gal-1 deficient (Lgals1(-/-)) mice showed increased parasitemia, reduced signs of inflammation in heart and skeletal muscle tissues, and lower survival rates as compared to wild-type (WT) mice in response to intraperitoneal infection with T. cruzi Tulahuen strain.

As a zoonosis, Trypanosoma cruzi infects about 180 species out of 25 families of mammals. Its regular transmission is through triatomines, which can easily transmit parasites either by the skin route (contamination of mammals skin with their feces) or by oral route (ingestion of food contaminated with complete triatomines or their feces) and additionally through haematogenous via (congenital and transfusional) and by tissues (transplants). The oral route, which seems to be the ancestral form of transmission to wild and domestic mammals, has recently become more important after the success achieved in the control of domicile vectors using residual pesticides. From its initial diagnosis in 1967, tens of oral outbreaks have been diagnosed mostly in the Brazilian Amazon and subsequently in other four countries in South America. Environmental imbalance caused by man through the invasion and deforestation of woodlands, results in reduction of biodiversity of mammals as food source for triatomines, affecting the ""dilution effect"" of T. cruzi in the nature increasing the risk of human infection. On the other hand, triatomines invade houses looking for new blood sources. One of the consequences of domiciliated triatomines is the food contamination spread, especially in home-made juices, which has been the source of infection of most oral outbreaks. Other biotic and abiotic factors help to explain the recent increase of oral transmission outbreaks of Chagas disease, distributed in nine eco-regions of America. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

No information on the bionomics of T. sherlocki exists, although such data are considered essential to estimate its vector and colonization potential in domestic environments. Herein, the biological cycle of T. sherlocki was studied based on 123 eggs, with nymphs and adults fed on Mus musculus (Linnaeus). Nymphal development time phases, number of meals consumed, and stage-specific mortality rates were analyzed. Survival time under starvation conditions was measured between ecdysis and death among 50 nymphs (first to fifth instar) and 50 male and female adults. The median development time from egg to adult was 621.0 (CI: 489-656) d. The number of meals consumed ranged from 1 to 20 for nymphs of the first to fifth instar. The fifth instar showed the greatest resistance to starvation, with amean of 156.5 d. The high number of meals consumed by T. sherlocki favored infection with and transmission of T. cruzi. The full development of this species under laboratory conditions with a lowmortality rate indicates that this vector presents biological characteristics that may contribute to its adaptation to artificial human ecotopes. Its high resistance to starvation emphasizes the importance of entomological surveillance for this species."

Actually, millions of people live in areas of exposure and are at risk of contracting the infection. Most of the infected individuals remain asymptomatic for all of their lives, but around 30% of the chronically infected individuals develop irreversible cardiac damage and 10% digestive lesions. Host genetic factors have been suggested to play an important role in the susceptibility or resistance to Chagas disease. In this work, we investigated variants of the IL18 gene in different Latin America populations. This gene encoded the interleukin-18, which is involved in the immune response to intracellular pathogens like T. cruzi. Our results showed that an IL18 gene variant plays an important role in the protection against T. cruzi infection. Host genetic factors have been suggested to play an important role in the susceptibility to Chagas disease. Given the influence of interleukin 18 (IL-18) in the development of the disease, in the present study, we analyzed three IL18 genetic variants (rs2043055, rs1946518, rs360719) regarding the predisposition to Trypanosoma cruzi infection and the development of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), in different Latin America populations. Genetic data of 3,608 patients from Colombia, Bolivia, Argentina, and Brazil were meta-analyzed to validate previous findings with increased statistical power. Seropositive and seronegative individuals were compared for T. cruzi infection susceptibility. In the Colombian cohort, the allelic frequencies of the three variants showed a significant association, with adjustment for sex and age, and also after applying multiple testing adjustments. Among the Colombian and Argentinean cohorts, rs360719 showed a significant genetic effect in a fixed-effects meta-analysis after a Bonferroni correction (OR: 0.76, CI: 0.66-0.89, P = 0.001). For CCC, the rs2043055 showed an association with protection from cardiomyopathy in the Colombian cohort (OR: 0.79, CI: 0.64-0.99, P = 0.037), with adjustment for sex and age, and after applying multiple testing adjustments. The meta-analysis of the CCC vs. asymptomatic patients from the four cohorts showed no evidence of association. In conclusion, our results validated the association found previously in the Colombian cohort suggesting that IL18 rs360719 plays an important role in the susceptibility to T. cruzi infection and no evidence of association was found between the IL18 genetic variants and CCC in the Latin American population studied."

The current infection risk is based on acute case reports, most of which are typically associated with oral transmissions. In the semi-arid region of Northeastern Brazil, serious outbreaks of this transmission type have surged in the last years. One of those occurred in 2016 in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. Rural residents of four municipalities surrounding Marcelino Vieira ingested sugar cane juice – which was probably ground with Trypanosoma cruzi-infected insects. Eighteen cases of Chagas disease were confirmed serologically, with two deaths reported. Socioeconomic information, schooling of residents and the structure of peridomestic and domestic environments in the rural area of Marcelino Vieira, along with entomological indicators, were investigated to understand better the factors related to the outbreaks in this region. We found triatomines (mainly Triatoma brasiliensis) in 35% (24/67) of domiciliary units and all rocky outcrops inspected (n = 7). Overall, 25% (91/357) of examined T. brasiliensis were infected by T. cruzi in artificial ecotopes, with almost the same prevalence in the sylvatic environment (22%; 35/154). Among all ecotopes investigated, wood/tile/brick piles were the ones linked to high insect infestations and triatomine T. cruzi infection prevalence. Ninety-five percent of people interviewed recognized the triatomines and knew the classic route of transmission of disease – triatomine bite-dependent. However, only 7.5% admitted knowledge that Chagas disease can also be acquired orally – which poses a risk this transmission route currently recognized. Here, we highlight the physical proximity between humans and triatomine populations with high T. cruzi infection prevalence as an additional risk factor to oral/vector contaminations. In sum, residents have low income, low level of education, and/or a willful disregard for the routes of Chagas disease transmission (specifically oral transmission), a combination of factors that may have favored the Chagas disease outbreak. We here provide recommendations to avoid further outbreaks. © 2020"

CDR was diagnosed by direct microscopy with detection of trypomastigote forms in the blood or other biological fluids and/or amastigote forms in inflammatory lesions. Results Out of 241 patients with co-infection, 86.7% were from Brazil, 47.5% had <200 CD4(+) T cells/mu L and median viral load was 17,000 copies/mu L. Sixty CDR cases were observed. Death was more frequent in patients with reactivation and was mainly caused by CDR. Other causes of death unrelated to CDR were the manifestation of opportunistic infections in those with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. The time between the co-infection diagnosis to death was shorter in patients with CDR. Lower CD4(+) cells count at co-infection diagnosis was independently associated with reactivation. Similarly, lower CD4(+) cells numbers at co-infection diagnosis and male sex were associated with higher lethality in CDR.

There is currently no effective therapy for Chagas disease. Although there is some evidence for the beneficial effect of bone marrow-derived cells in chagasic disease, the mechanisms underlying their effects in the heart are unknown. Reports have suggested that bone marrow cells are recruited to the chagasic heart; however, studies using chimeric mouse models of chagasic cardiomyopathy are rare. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate the migration of bone marrow cells to the heart after T. cruzi infection in a model of chagasic disease in chimeric mice. METHODS To obtain chimerical mice, wild-type (WT) C57BL6 mice were exposed to full body irradiation (7 Gy), causing bone marrow ablation. Then, bone marrow cells from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic mice were infused into the mice. Graft effectiveness was confirmed by flow cytometry. Experimental mice were divided into four groups: (i) infected chimeric (iChim) mice; (ii) infected WT (iWT) mice, both of which received 3 x 104 trypomastigotes of the Brazil strain; (iii) non-infected chimeric (Chim) mice; and (iv) non-infected WT mice. FINDINGS At one- month post-infection, iChim and iWT mice showed first degree atrioventricular block with decreased heart rate and treadmill exercise parameters compared to those in the non-infected groups. MAIN CONCLUSIONS iChim mice showed an increase in parasitaemia, myocarditis, and the presence of amastigote nests in the heart tissue compared to iWT mice. Flow cytometry analysis did not detect haematopoietic progenitor cells in the hearts of infected mice. Furthermore, GFP+ cardiomyocytes were not detected in the tissues of chimeric mice."

Even with optimized serological assays that use parasite-specific recombinant antigens, inconclusive test results continue to be a problem. Therefore, new serological tests with high sensitivity and specificity are needed. In the present work, we developed and evaluated the performance of a new flow cytometric serological method, referred to as FC-TRIPLEX Chagas/Leish IgG1, for the all-in-one classification of inconclusive tests. The method uses antigens for the detection of visceral leishmaniasis, localized cutaneous leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease and is based on an inverted detuned algorithm for analysis of anti-Trypanosomatidae IgG1 reactivity. First, parasites were label with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Alexa Fluor 647 at various concentrations. Then serum samples were serially diluted, the dilutions were incubated with suspensions of mixed labeled parasites, and flow cytometric measurements were performed to determine percentages of positive fluorescent parasites. Using the new method, we obtained correct results for 76 of 80 analyzed serum samples (95% overall performance), underscoring the outstanding performance of the method. Moreover, we found that the fluorescently labeled parasite suspensions were stable during storage at room temperature, 4 degrees C, and -20 degrees C for 1 year. In addition, two different lots of parasite suspensions showed equivalent antigen recognition; that is, the two lots showed equivalent categorical segregation of anti-Trypanosomatidae IgG1 reactivity at selected serum dilutions.

Methods Through bibliometric and Social Network Analysis, we examined patterns of research on Chagas cardiomyopathy, identifying the main countries, authors, research clusters, and topics addressed; and measuring the contribution of different countries. Results We found 1932 documents on Chagas cardiomyopathy in the MEDLINE database. The most common document type was 'journal article', accounting for 79.6% of the total (n = 1538), followed by 'review' (n = 217, 11.2%). The number of published records increased from 156 in 1980-1984 to 311 in 2010-2014. Only 2.5% were clinical trials. Brazil and the USA dominated the research, participating in 53.1% and 25.7%, respectively, of the documents. Other Latin American countries where Chagas is endemic contributed less, with Bolivia, where Chagas disease is most prevalent, producing only 1.8% of the papers. We observed a high rate of domestic collaboration (83.1% of the documents published in 2010-2016) and a lower but significant rate of international collaboration (32.5% in the same time period). Although clinical research dominated overall, the USA, Mexico and several countries in Europe produced a considerable body of basic research on animal models. We identified four main research clusters, focused on heart failure and dysfunction (physical symptoms, imaging techniques, treatment), and on myocarditis and parasitemia in animal models. Conclusions Research on Chagas cardiomyopathy increased over the study period. There were more clinical than basic studies, though very few of the documents were clinical trials. Brazil and the USA are currently leading the research on this subject, while some highly endemic countries, such as Bolivia, have contributed very little. Different approaches could help to redress this imbalance: encouraging researchers to conduct more clinical trials, launching international collaborations to help endemic countries contribute more, and strengthening links between basic and clinical research."

Overall, 87% (54/62) of sampled dogs were positive for at least one trypanosomatid species, in single (n = 9) and co-infections (n = 45). We found that 76% of dogs were positive for T. cruzi, four of them displayed high parasitemias demonstrated by hemoculture, including one strain types TcI, two TcIII and one TcIII/TcV. Around 73% (45/62) of dogs were positive to T. evansi, three with high parasitemias as seen by positive microhematocrit centrifuge technique. Of dogs sampled, 50% (31/62) were positive for Leishmania spp. by PCR or serology. We found a positive influence of (i) T. evansi on mucous pallor, (ii) co-infection by T. cruzi and Leishmania with onychogryphosis, and (iii) all parasites to skin lesions of sampled dogs. Finally, feeding on wild mammals had a positive influence in the Leishmania spp. infection in dogs. We found that 28% (5/18) coati Nasua nasua was co-infected for all three trypanosamatids, demonstrating that it might play a key role in maintenance of these parasites. Our results showed the importance of Urucum region as a hotspot for T. cruzi, T. evansi and Leishmania spp. and demonstrated that dogs can be considered as incidental hosts."

Previous studies have already indicated that this species is associated with rodents of the Caviidae family-mainly in the sylvatic environment. In this study, we showed that these rodents are the main food sources ofT.brasiliensisalso in peridomestic environments. This association is frequently followed by numerous populations ofT.cruziinfected insects in man-made ecotopes to store materials of mineral and wood origin. We suggest that the key-host that drives these infestations are mainlyGalea spixii, followed byKerodon rupestris(both Rodentia: Caviidae), which seem to be in synanthropic processes because they were found as frequent blood meals forT.brasiliensisin the sylvatic and domestic environments. Other mammals-mainly cats-may play an important role in Chagas disease eco-epidemiology for also being an important source of food for triatomines in the sylvatic and peridomestic environments. We conclude that educational programs to avoid Chagas disease transmission should include advising local people to avoid storing wood and tiles/bricks in the peridomestic environment-shelters for key-host rodents. Besides, they must be aware that these cavies may be infected byT.cruzi; and cautions are needed if they are to be used as a source of protein by hunting. Innovative approaches used to combat Chagas disease transmission tend to combine a set of comprehensive efforts to understand the ecology of local vectors. In this work we identified molecularly the blood meal of 181Triatoma brasiliensis, distributed in 18 populations (8 sylvatic and 10 peridomestic), which were collected across a range of 240 km (East-West) and 95 km (North-South) in the semi-arid region of northeastern, Brazil. We used the vertebrate mitochondrial gene (cytochrome B) sequencing applied to DNA isolated from bug midgut to identify the insect blood meal sources via the BLAST procedure. The peridomestic populations were classified according to two main hypotheses of site-occupancy forT.brasiliensis: the first says that the infestation is mainly driven by structures that resemble its natural habitat (stony-like ecotopes) and the second assumes that it is associated with key-hosts (rodents and goats). Rodents of the Caviidae family (Galea spixiiandKerodon rupestris) were identified as the key-host ofT.brasiliensis, but also the potentialTrypanosoma cruzireservoir-able to connect the sylvatic and domesticT.cruzicycle. Cats also deserve to be studied better, as potentialT.cruzireservoirs. By modeling the food sources + site-occupancy +T.cruzinatural infection, we identified man-made ecotopes suitable for forming dense triatomine infestations with high rates ofT.cruzinatural infection, which may be taken into account for vector control measures."

Our objective is to determine factors associated with mortality and recurrence of IS in patients with IS and Chagas disease. Methods: We retrospectively studied data obtained from electronic medical records of patients admitted at SARAH Hospitals across Brazil between 2009 and 2013. Using Cox regression analysis for mortality and logistic regression for recurrence, we assessed primary population characteristics and statistical associations between risk factors and outcomes. Results: We analyzed 279 patients who were followed up until 2016. The mean age at stroke onset was 61 with a 10% frequency of death. Multivariate analysis assessing mortality demonstrated that the associated factors were age at stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04), initial modified Rankin Scale (mRS; HR 20.91), bladder dysfunction (HR 2.51), diabetes mellitus (DM; HR 3.64), and alcoholism (HR 3.37). Multivariate analysis assessing recurrence demonstrated that the associated factors were age at ictus (OR 0.96), cognitive deficit (OR 0.44), initial mRS (OR 1.84), cardioembolic etiology (OR 2.47), and female sex (OR 2.73). Conclusions: Cardiac conditions did not correlate with mortality or recurrence. Age was a protective factor against recurrence, probably due to cumulative risk of IS over time, while initial mRS was associated with both outcomes. Treating diseases such as DM and bladder dysfunction, and early treatment to reduce the initial mRS could potentially prevent both outcomes; also, establishing a correct etiological diagnosis is important.

Furthermore, we evaluated whether the diversity of trypanosomatids changes according to bat diversity and the different levels of preservation in the region. The results showed no influence of the level of preservation on bat species richness (15 and 14 species, respectively), with similar chiropterofauna and higher abundance of two common fruit-eating bat species in the tropics: Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus lituratus. Of the 181 bat specimens analyzed by LIT/Schneider hemoculture, we detected 24 infected individuals (13%), including one positive Sturnira lilium individual that was also positive by fresh blood examination. Molecular characterization using nested PCR targeting the 18 SSU rRNA-encoding gene fragment showed similar trypanosomatid infection rates in bats from the two areas: 15% in REGUA and 11% in EFMA (p = 0.46). Trypanosoma dionisii was the most frequently detected parasite (54%), followed by T. cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV and Trypanosoma sp., in Neotropical phyllostomid bats (RNMO63 and RNMO56); mixed infections by T. dionisii/T. cruzi TcIII and T. dionisii/T. cruzi TcI were also observed. The T. cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV are the genotypes currently involved in cases of acute Chagas disease in Brazil, and T. dionisii was recently found in the heart tissue of an infected child. Surprisingly, we also describe for the first time Crithidia mellificae, a putative monoxenous parasite from insects, infecting a vertebrate host in the Americas. Bats from the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state harbor a great diversity of trypanosomatids, maintaining trypanosomatid diversity in this sylvatic environment. Author summary Among all mammals carrying trypanosomatids, bats are considered some of the most ancient hosts, and due to their good adaptation to different landscape features, they may play an important role in parasite dispersion. To assess whether the diversity of trypanosomatid species in bats is affected by the level of environmental disturbance, we collected blood from bats in two localities of Rio Janeiro state in Brazil: one with high and another with low human interference (more preserved). The collected blood was subjected to fresh blood tests and hemoculture. Using the 18S RNA gene as a molecular target, we identified 24 bats (13%) infected by trypanosomatids, mostly by T. dionisii, a trypanosome species commonly found in all Brazilian biomes and highly associated with bats. Three subpopulations (DTUs I, III and IV) of T. cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, were also found to infect bats. In addition, we detected for the first time a putative insect-associated parasite, Crithidia mellificae, in a mammal host in the Americas. Our work reveals the high diversity of trypanosomatids infecting bats of the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state, reinforcing their importance as potential reservoirs of trypanosomatids."

Currently, some of the most relevant changes are related to: (i) the reduction in the incidence of the endemic due to the control of the most important vectors, Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus, in many countries; (ii) the migration of human populations spreading cases of the disease throughout the world, from endemic to non-endemic areas, transforming Chagas disease into a global threat; and (iii) new acute cases and deaths caused by oral transmission, especially in the north of Brazil. Despite the reduction in the number of cases, new challenges need to be responded to, including monitoring and control activities aiming to prevent house infestation by the secondary vectors from occurring. In 1979, Lent & Wygodzinsky(1) published the most complete review of the subfamily Triatominae, encompassing 111 recognised species in the taxon. Forty-two years later, 46 new species and one subspecies have been described or revalidated.

The strategy, however, is ineffective against sylvatic triatomines, which can transmit Chagas disease by invading (without colonizing) man-made structures. Despite growing awareness of the relevance of these transmission dynamics, the drivers of house invasion by sylvatic triatomines remain poorly understood. Methods/Findings About 12,000 sylvatic triatomines were caught during routine surveillance in houses of Tocantins state, Brazil, in 2005-2013. Using negative binomial regression, information-theoretic model evaluation/averaging, and external model validation, we investigated the effects of regional (Amazon/Cerrado), landscape (preservation/disturbance), and climate covariates (temperature, rainfall) on the municipality-aggregated numbers of house-invading Rhodnius pictipes, R. robustus, R. neglectus, and Panstrongylus geniculatus. House invasion by R. pictipes and R. robustus was overall more frequent in the Amazon biome, tended to increase in municipalities with more well-preserved land, and decreased in rainier municipalities. Across species, invasion decreased with higher landscape-disturbance levels and in hotter-day municipalities. Invasion by R. neglectus and P. geniculatus increased somewhat with more land at intermediate disturbance and peaked in average-rainfall municipalities. Temperature effects were more pronounced on P. geniculatus than on Rhodnius spp. Conclusions We report widespread, frequent house invasion by sylvatic triatomines in the Amazon-Cerrado transition. Our analyses indicate that readily available environmental metrics may help predict the risk of contact between sylvatic triatomines and humans at coarse geographic scales, and hint at specific hypotheses about climate and deforestation effects on those vectors-with some taxon-specific responses and some seemingly general trends. Thus, our focal species appear to be quite sensitive to higher temperatures, and might be less common in more heavily-disturbed than in better-preserved environments. This study illustrates, in sum, how entomological routine-surveillance data can be efficiently used for Chagas disease risk prediction and stratification when house-colonizing vectors are absent."

TcII is among the major DTUs enrolled in human infections in South America southern cone, where it is associated with severe cardiac and digestive symptoms. Despite the importance of TcII in Chagas disease epidemiology and pathology, so far, no genome-wide comparisons of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of TcII field isolates have been performed to track the variability and evolution of this DTU in endemic regions. Results: In the present work, we have sequenced and compared the whole nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of seven TcII strains isolated from chagasic patients from the central and northeastern regions of Minas Gerais, Brazil, revealing an extensive genetic variability within this DTU. A comparison of the phylogeny based on the nuclear or mitochondrial genomes revealed that the majority of branches were shared by both sequences. The subtle divergences in the branches are probably consequence of mitochondrial introgression events between TcII strains. Two T. cruzi strains isolated from patients living in the central region of Minas Gerais, S15 and S162a, were clustered in the nuclear and mitochondrial phylogeny analysis. These two strains were isolated from the other five by the Espinhaco Mountains, a geographic barrier that could have restricted the traffic of insect vectors during T. cruzi evolution in the Minas Gerais state. Finally, the presence of aneuploidies was evaluated, revealing that all seven TcII strains have a different pattern of chromosomal duplication/loss. Conclusions: Analysis of genomic variability and aneuploidies suggests that there is significant genomic variability within Minas Gerais TcII strains, which could be exploited by the parasite to allow rapid selection of favorable phenotypes. Also, the aneuploidy patterns vary among T. cruzi strains and does not correlate with the nuclear phylogeny, suggesting that chromosomal duplication/loss are recent and frequent events in the parasite evolution."

The diversity of vector species and their habitats are among the factors that hinder the control of the disease. Control programs periodically monitor the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in insect bugs through microscopical observation of diluted feces. However, microscopy presents limited sensitivity in samples with low parasite numbers, difficulties in examining all evolutionary stages of the insect and may in turn be limited to differentiate T. cruzi from other morphologically similar trypanosomatids. Here, we report two highly sensitive and accurate methodologies to infer T. cruzi infection rates and to quantify parasite load in the gut of field-collected triatomines. Methods: Triatomines were manually collected in the period 2011-2012 and 2014-2015, in domestic, peridomestic or sylvatic habitats in rural areas of 26 municipalities, encompassing three distinct Brazilian biomes: Caatinga, Cerrado and Atlantic Rainforest. Following morphological and taxonomical identification, the search for flagellated protozoa was performed by optical microscopy. A conventional PCR targeting T. cruzi kDNA and a TaqMan qPCR directed to the parasite nuclear satellite DNA (SAT) were developed, both in multiplex, with the triatomine 12S subunit ribosomal RNA gene, used as internal amplification control. Both methods were used for detection (kDNA-PCR) and parasite load quantification (SAT-DNA-qPCR), to investigate T. cruzi infection in captured triatomines. Results: The combined methods were assayed on a panel of 205 field-collected triatomine samples. Diagnostic analysis revealed 21% positivity for the kDNA-PCR, whereas microscopic examination enabled identification of T. cruzi in only 7.0% of the PCR-positive samples. Negative PCR results were confirmed by the absence of T. cruzi flagellates using microscopy. Caatinga biome yielded the highest T. cruzi infection rate (60%), followed by the Atlantic Rainforest and Cerrado with 7.1 and 6.1%, respectively. In addition, a wide range distribution of parasite load, varying from 8.05 x 10(-2) to 6.31 x 10(10) was observed with a median of 2.29 x 10(3) T. cruzi/intestine units. When parasite load was analyzed by triatomine species, a significantly higher median was found for Panstrongylus lutzi in comparison with Triatoma brasiliensis. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate highly sensitive PCR-based methodologies to monitor T. cruzi infection in triatomines. In addition, the qPCR assay offers the possibility of further evaluation parasite load, as a promising biomarker of the vectorial capacity of triatomines in Chagas disease endemic areas."

The present study evaluated the diagnostic performance of parasitological, molecular, and serological techniques for detecting 27 strains of T. cruzi that belonged to discrete typing units (DTUs) TcI (11 strains), TcII (four strains), and TcIV (12 strains) that were obtained from different hosts in the states of Amazonas and Parana, Brazil. Blood samples were taken from experimentally infected mice and analyzed by fresh blood examination, hemoculture in Liver Infusion Tryptose (LIT) medium, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Polymerase chain reaction presented the best detection of TcI, with 80.4% positivity. For all of the detection methods, the animals that were inoculated with TcII presented the highest positivity rates (94.1-100%). ELISA that was performed 7 months after inoculation presented a higher detection ability (95.4%) for TcIV. Intra-DTU comparisons showed that the reproducibility of the majority of the results that were obtained with the different methods was weak for TcI and good for TcII and TcIV. Our data indicate that the detection capability of different techniques varies with the DTUs of the parasites in mammalian blood. The implications of these findings with regard to the diagnosis of human T. cruzi infection are discussed. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc."

This species overlaps with T. brasiliensis in geographic and ecotypic occupation in the sylvatic habitat because both inhabit rocky outcrops in the semi-arid portion of Brazilian northeast. In this region T. brasiliensis is the most important Chagas disease vector because it constantly colonizes domiciles. In contrast, T. petrocchiae is rarely found in peri or intradomiciliary habitats - reason why little is known about this species. Therefore, Here, we present information for the first time on. the T. petrocchiae ecotopes, genetic diversity, Trypanosoma cruzi prevalence/genotyping in comparison to T. brasiliensis. We found T. brasilensis (N=223) and T. petrocchiae (N=69) in co-habitation in rocky outcrops in three Districts of Paraiba and Rio Grande do Norte states. Forty-tree T. petrocchiae insects of eleven sampling spots (composing three geographic populations) were genotyped for the mitochondrial Cyt B gene and little geographic structure was observed. Tajima's D test suggested that species is evolving toward a mutation-drift equilibrium in our collection range. Sylvatic T. petrocchiae had 4% (3/68) of infected insects by T. cruzi, whereas T. brasiliensis had 26% (59/223). Fluorescent Fragment Length Barcoding demonstrated that all three T. petrocchiae harbored TcI whereas T. brasiliensis had TcI, but also TcIII, TcII/TcVI and T. rangeli genotype A, sometimes under mixed infections. None of infected T. petrocchiae were carrying mixed infections. However, this result should be confirmed using a larger pool of infected bugs. We here presented the first documentation of T. rangeli infecting T. brasiliensis. The finding of infected T. petrocchiae calls for constant vector monitoring because the epidemiologic scenario is dynamic and sylvatic vectors are progressively found in adaptation to anthropic environments."

It is considered an important vector of Chagas disease in this region, presenting high rates of natural infection with Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, 1909, and readily invading houses by flight. This study describes a previously unknown chromosomal sex system in the genus Panstrongylus based on P. lutzi. Methods: Fifth-instar and male adults of P. lutzi originating from municipality of Varzea Alegre, Ceara (Brazil) were analysed. Chromosomal analyses of male meiotic process were done by Giemsa staining. Results: Chromosomal analyses of male meiosis reveal a diploid chromosome number of 24 chromosomes (20 autosomes plus X1X2X3Y). During meiotic prophase I, the sex chromosomes remained close together, forming four heteropycnotic chromocenters in zygotene, and a single chromocenter in pachytene and diplotene. Still at the diplotene stage, each one of the ten autosomal bivalents showed an evident chiasma. In metaphase I, the four sex chromosomes appeared clearly separated. The three X chromosomes were the smallest of the complement and isopycnotic with respect to the Y chromosome. Two bivalents appear larger, whereas the other eight showed no significant difference in size. Conclusion: Karyotype analysis of P. lutzi revealed a new sex system in the genus Panstrongylus. This result is of utmost importance to karyosystematics of P. lutzi, and demonstrates the need for further studies of this type in the subfamily Triatominae."

They are also intensely parasitized and implicated in multiple viral, bacterial and parasitic zoonoses. Trypanosomes are thought to be especially abundant and diverse in bats. In this study, we used 18S ribosomal RNA metabarcoding to probe bat trypanosome diversity in unprecedented detail. Methodology/Principal Findings Total DNA was extracted from the blood of 90 bat individuals (17 species) captured along Atlantic Forest fragments of Espirito Santo state, southeast Brazil. 18S ribosomal RNA was amplified by standard and/or nested PCR, then deep sequenced to recover and identify Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) for phylogenetic analysis. Blood samples from 34 bat individuals (13 species) tested positive for infection by 18S rRNA amplification. Amplicon sequences clustered to 14 OTUs, of which five were identified as Trypanosoma cruzi I, T. cruzi III/V, Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei, Trypanosoma rangeli, and Trypanosoma dionisii, and seven were identified as novel genotypes monophyletic to basal T. cruzi clade types of the New World. Another OTU was identified as a trypanosome like those found in reptiles. Surprisingly, the remaining OTU was identified as Bodo saltans-closest non-parasitic relative of the trypanosomatid order. While three blood samples featured just one OTU (T. dionisii), all others resolved as mixed infections of up to eight OTUs. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates the utility of next-generation barcoding methods to screen parasite diversity in mammalian reservoir hosts. We exposed high rates of local bat parasitism by multiple trypanosome species, some known to cause fatal human disease, others non-pathogenic, novel or yet little understood. Our results highlight bats as a long-standing nexus among host-parasite interactions of multiple niches, sustained in part by opportunistic and incidental infections of consequence to evolutionary theory as much as to public health."

This species is predominantly found in domestic environments, and it has the ability to build large colonies with high levels of natural infection via Trypanosoma cruzi. Thus, T. brasiliensis is one of the most efficient transmitters of Chagas disease (CD) to humans. Despite household spraying with residual insecticides, many areas report persistent reinfestations for reasons that remain poorly understood. Therefore, this study sought to characterize the toxicological profile of deltamethrin in T. brasiliensis from areas with persistent reinfestation in State of Ceara, Brazil. Methods: The susceptibility reference lineage (SRL) was derived from Umari. Serial dilutions of deltamethrin were prepared and applied to the dorsal abdomen of first instar nymphs. The control group received only pure acetone. Mortality was evaluated after 72h. Qualitative tests assessed mortality in response to a diagnostic dose of 1xLD(99) (0.851 nanograms of active ingredient per treated nymph) of the SRL. Results: The susceptibility profile characterization of the T. brasiliensis populations revealed 50% resistance ratios (RR50) that ranged from 0.32 to 1.21. The percentage of mortality in response to the diagnostic dose was 100%. Conclusions: We demonstrated that T. brasiliensis was highly susceptible to deltamethrin. The control difficulties found might be related to the recolonization of the triatomines originating from neighboring environments and the possible operational failures related to the process of spraying that enabled specimens less susceptible to deltamethrin to survive."

However, congenital transmission rates are low for T. cruzi and high for T. gondii. Infection success or failure depends on complex parasite-host interactions in which parasites can alter host gene expression by modulating non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs. As of yet, there are no reports on altered miRNA expression in placental tissue in response to either parasite. Therefore, we infected human placental explants ex vivo by cultivation with either T. cruzi or T. gondii for 2 h. We then analyzed the miRNA expression profiles of both types of infected tissue by miRNA sequencing and quantitative PCR, sequence-based miRNA target prediction, pathway functional enrichment, and upstream regulator analysis of differentially expressed genes targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs. Both parasites induced specific miRNA profiles. GO analysis revealed that the in silico predicted targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs regulated different cellular processes involved in development and immunity, and most of the identified KEGG pathways were related to chronic diseases and infection. Considering that the differentially expressed miRNAs identified here modulated crucial host cellular targets that participate in determining the success of infection, these miRNAs might explain the differing congenital transmission rates between the two parasites. Molecules of the different pathways that are regulated by miRNAs and modulated during infection, as well as the miRNAs themselves, may be potential targets for the therapeutic control of either congenital Chagas disease or toxoplasmosis."

We carried out a cross-sectional survey of house infestation in a well-defined rural area of northeastern Argentina to identify the key habitats of T. sordida; describe its spatial distribution in an apparently undisturbed setting under no recent insecticide treatment and use metapopulation theory to investigate these spatially structured populations. Timed-manual searches in 2,177 georeferenced sites from 368 houses yielded T. sordida in 78 sites (house infestation prevalence, 19.9%). Most triatomines occurred in chicken nests, chicken coops, and trees where chickens roosted (prime habitats). Goat or sheep corrals and pig corrals had a lower fraction of occupied sites (occupancies) and abundance. Both occupancy and catch increased with increasing refuge availability according to multimodel inference with model averaging. The majority of suitable habitats were unoccupied despite their proximity to occupied sites. The site-specific occurrence of T. sordida and Triatoma infestans Klug (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) was positively and homogeneously associated over ecotopes, showing no evidence of interspecific interference. An incidence function metapopulation model (including intersite distances and vector carrying capacity) predicted a fivefold greater occupancy relative to the observed pattern, suggesting the latter represented a transient state. T. sordida failed to colonize human sleeping quarters, thrived in peridomestic habitats occupied by chickens, and had a limited occupancy likely related to a poor colonizing ability and the relative instability of its prime habitats."

The morphological pattern of TcII strains was consistent with broad forms of the parasite. In TcIV strains, slender forms predominated. The Y strain (TcII) was morphologically more similar to TcIV. Significant differences in polymorphisms were observed between DTUs. Metacyclogenesis parameters, although displaying large standard deviations, differed between the DTUs, with the following descending rank order: TcII > TcI > TcIV. The mean numbers of metacyclic trypomastigotes for TcII were significantly higher than the other DTUs. Although the DTUs presented overlapping characteristics, the general pattern was that different DTU5 exhibited significantly different morphologies and metacyclogenesis, suggesting that the genetic diversity of T. cruzi could be related to parameters that are associated with the evolution of infection in mammalian hosts and its ability to disperse in nature.

Taking into account that developing such a diagnostic tool will significantly improve the ability to identify CD carriers, we aimed at performing a proof-of-concept study (phase I study) to assess the use of these proteins in a point-of-care platform using serum samples from different geographical settings of Brazil and distinct clinical presentations. The diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on a panel of two WHO International Standards (IS) and 14 sera fromT. cruzi-positive and 16 fromT. cruzi-negative individuals. The results obtained with the test strips were converted to digital images, allowing quantitative comparison expressed as a relative band intensity ratio (RBI). The diagnostic potential and performance were also determined. Regardless of the geographical origin or clinical presentation, all sera withT. cruziantibodies returned positive both for IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) values was 100% for both antigens, demonstrating an outstanding overall diagnostic accuracy (100%).

Studies show that the principal factor hindering the control of triatomines is reinfestation of houses previously treated with insecticides. Studies at the microgeographic level are therefore necessary to better understand these events. However, an efficient molecular marker is not yet available for carrying out such analyses in this species. The aim of the present study was to identify and characterize microsatellite loci for future population genetic studies of P. megistus.Methods This study work consisted of five stages: (i) sequencing of genomic DNA; (ii) assembly and selection of contigs containing microsatellites; (iii) validation of amplification and evaluation of polymorphic loci; (iv) standardization of the polymorphic loci; and (v) verification of cross-amplification with other triatomine species.ResultsSequencing of males and females generated 7,908,463 contigs with a total length of 2,043,422,613 bp. A total of 2,043,690 regions with microsatellites in 1,441,091 contigs were obtained, with mononucleotide repeats being the most abundant class. From a panel of 96 loci it was possible to visualize polymorphisms in 64.55% of the loci. Of the 20 loci genotyped, the number of alleles varied from two to nine with an average of 4.9. Cross-amplification with other species of triatomines was observed in 13 of the loci.ConclusionsDue to the high number of alleles encountered, polymorphism and the capacity to amplify from geographically distant populations, the microsatellites described here show promise for utilization in population genetic studies of P. megistus."

Blood donation centers screen for anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies using highly sensitive immunoenzymatic (ELISA) or chemiluminescent methods, which can lead to false positive results. Since positive samples cannot be used, to avoid the loss of valuable blood donations, it is necessary to improve specificity without reducing the sensitivity of the tests used for blood screening. For this purpose, our group has developed four chimeric proteins (IBMP-8.1, IBMP-8.2, IBMP-8.3, and IBMP-8.4) that have been evaluated in phase I and II studies with high performance and low cross-reactivity rates. The study included a panel of 5,014 serum samples collected from volunteer blood donors at the Hematology and Hemotherapy Foundation of the State of Bahia (Brazil). They were subjected to the detection of anti-T. cruzi antibodies, using all four IBMP antigens individually and latent class analysis (LCA) as a reference test, since there is no gold standard test for this purpose. Considering the sample size analyzed, LCA classified 4,993 (99.6%) samples as T. cruzi-negative and 21 (0.42%) as T. cruzi-positive. Sensitivity values ranged from 85.71% for IBMP-8.1 and 90.48% for IBMP-8.2-95.24% for IBMP-8.3 and 100% for IBMP-8.4, while specificity ranged from 99.98% for IBMP-8.3 and IBMP-8.4-100% for IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.2. Accuracy values ranged from 99.4 to 99.98%.

The higher odds ratio diagnosis was found for IBMP-8.4, which has been shown to be a safe single antigen for serological screening of CD in blood samples. The use of chimeric IBMP antigens is an alternative to reduce the number of bags discarded due to false-positive results. These molecules have high diagnostic performance and were shown to be suitable for use in screening CD in blood banks, isolated (IBMP-8.4) or in combination; and their use in blood banks could significantly reduce unnecessary disposal of blood bags or the risk of T. cruzi transmission."

Neotropical mammals are important hosts of Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. the etiological agents of Chagas disease and Leishmaniasis respectively. Studies of trypanosomatid-infected mammals and vectors (triatomines and sandflies) in zoos are important for the establishment of surveillance and control measures. Objectives We investigated trypanosomatid infections in captive wild mammals, triatomines and sandflies at the Brasilia Zoo. Methods We collected triatomines during active bimonthly surveys, sampled sandflies using light-traps and obtained blood samples from 74 mammals between 2016 and 2017. We used quantitative PCR to detect trypanosomatids in vectors and mammals. Results We found a colony of 19 Panstrongylus megistus in the porcupine unit and detected T. cruzi infections in five bugs. We captured 17 sandflies of four species including Nyssomyia whitmani and Lutzomyia longipalpis, but no Leishmania infection was detected. qPCR detected 50 T. cruzi-infected mammals belonging to 24 species and five groups of mammals (Carnivora, Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Pilosa and Primates); Leishmania DNA was detected in 23 mammals from 15 species, mainly carnivores. We detected trypanosomatid infections in 11 mammals born at the Brasilia Zoo. Conclusions Our results suggest vector-borne transmission of T. cruzi among maned wolves; measures to reduce the risk of new infections should therefore be taken. We also report sandfly presence and Leishmania-infected mammals at the Brasilia Zoo. Translocation of wild mammals in and out of the Brasilia Zoo should consider the risk of T. cruzi and Leishmania spread."

Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for the cure of the disease. Our aim was to evaluate techniques and samples used for the diagnosis of CCD in order to improve diagnostic strategies. Methods: A total of 181 children born in Spain from Latin American Chagas-infected mothers were consecutively enrolled and studied by microhematocrit, PCR and serology tests at 0-2, 6 and 9-12 months of age and followed up when it was required. Samples of cord blood and peripheral blood were collected for T. cruzi detection by PCR. Parasite culture was performed in patients with a positive PCR. Results: Of 181 children, 7 children (3.9%) were lost to follow-up. A total of 174 children completed follow-up, 12 were diagnosed with CCD (6.9%) and 162 (93.1%) as uninfected children (negative serology tests at the end of the follow-up). Traditional parasitological diagnosis by microhematocrit had a poor performance (sensitivity was 10%), while PCR in peripheral blood showed high sensitivity (90.9%) and specificity (100%), allowing the early diagnosis of 9 infected children during the first 6-months-old. In the other 3 congenital cases, diagnosis was only possible at 12 months by serological and molecular techniques. However, PCR in cord blood showed low sensitivity (33.3%) and less specificity (96.4%) for the diagnosis.

We assessed infection rates and metacyclogenesis of T.cruzi (TcVI) in fifth-instar nymphs of Triatoma rubrovaria comparing with the primary vector Triatoma infestans. Also, biological parameters related to feeding-excretion behavior were evaluated aiming to identify which variables are most influenced by T.cruzi infection. Methodology/principal findings Fifth-instar nymphs of T.rubrovaria and T.infestans were fed on mice infected with T. cruzi(TcVI). We compared the presence and the number of parasite evolutive forms in excreta of both triatomine species at 30, 60 and 90 days post-infection (dpi) with traditional statistical analyses. Moreover, both species were analyzed through generalized linear models and multinomial logistic regression hypotheses for seven behavioral parameters related to host-seeking and feeding-excretion. Triatoma rubrovaria and T.infestans had similar overall infection and metacyclogenesis rates of T.cruzi TcVI in laboratory conditions. Regarding vector behavior, we confirmed that the triatomine's tendency is to move away from the bite region after a blood meal, probably to avoid being noticed by the vertebrate host. Interspecific differences were observed on the volume of blood ingested and on the proportion of individuals that excreted after the blood meal, revealing the higher feeding efficiency and dejection rates of T.infestans. The amount of ingested blood and the bite behavior of T.rubrovaria seems to be influenced by TcVI infection. Infected specimens tended to ingest similar to 25% more blood and to bite more the head of the host. Noteworthy, in two occasions, kleptohematophagy and coprophagy behaviors were also observed in T. rubrovaria. Conclusions/significance Laboratory infections revealed similar rate of T.cruzi VI trypomatigotes in excreta of T.rubrovaria and T. infestans, one of the most epidemiological important vectors of T. cruzi. Therefore, TcVI DTU was able to complete its life cycle in T. rubrovaria under laboratory conditions, and this infection changed the feeding behavior of T. rubrovaria. Considering these results,T. rubrovaria must be kept under constant entomological surveillance in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil."

Effective clinical management depend largely on early and unequivocal diagnosis, however, cross-reactivity have also been described in serological tests, especially when it refers to individuals from areas where Chagas' disease is also present. Thus, to discover new antigens to improve the current serological tests for VL diagnosis is urgently needed. Here, we performed an immunogenomic screen strategy to identify conserved linear B-cell epitopes in the predicted L. infantum proteome using the following criteria: i) proteins expressed in the stages found in the vertebrate host, amastigote stage, and secreted/excreted, to guarantee greater exposure to the immune system; ii) divergent from proteins present in other infectious disease pathogens with incidence in endemic areas for VL, as T. cruzi; iii) highly antigenic to humans with different genetic backgrounds, independently of the clinical stage of the disease; iv) stable and adaptable to quality-control tests to guarantee reproducibility; v) using statistical analysis to determine a suitable sample size to evaluate accuracy of diagnostic tests established by receiver operating characteristic strategy. We selected six predicted linear B-cell epitopes from three proteins of L. infantum parasite. The results demonstrated that a mixture of peptides (Mix IV: peptides 3+6) were able to identify VL cases and simultaneously able to discriminate infections caused by T. cruzi parasite with high accuracy (100.00%) and perfect agreement (Kappa index = 1.000) with direct methods performed by laboratories in Brazil. The results also demonstrated that peptide-6, Mix III (peptides 2+6) and I (peptides 2+3+6) are potential antigens able to used in VL diagnosis, represented by high accuracy (Ac = 99.52%, 99.52% and 98.56%, respectively). This study represents an interesting strategy for discovery new antigens applied to serologic diagnosis which will contribute to the improvement of the diagnosis of VL and, consequently, may help in the prevention, control and treatment of the disease in endemic areas of Brazil."

Mechanisms of oral infection and host-cell invasion by these parasites are poorly understood. To address that question, we analyzed T. cruzi strains isolated from chagasic patients in Venezuela, Guatemala and Brazil. Methods: Trypanosoma cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes were orally inoculated into mice. The mouse stomach collected four days later, as well as the stomach and the heart collected 30 days post-infection, were processed for histological analysis. Assays to mimic parasite migration through the gastric mucus layer were performed by counting the parasites that traversed gastric mucin-coated transwell filters. For cell invasion assays, human epithelial HeLa cells were incubated with metacyclic forms and the number of internalized parasites was counted. Results: All TcI and TcIV T. cruzi strains were poorly infective by the oral route. Parasites were either undetectable or were detected in small numbers in the mouse stomach four days post oral administration. Replicating parasites were found in the stomach and/or in the heart 30 days post-infection. As compared to TcI lineage, the migration capacity of TcIV parasites through the gastric mucin-coated filter was higher but lower than that exhibited by TcVI metacyclic forms previously shown to be highly infective by the oral route. Expression of pepsin-resistant gp90, the surface molecule that downregulates cell invasion, was higher in TcI than in TcIV parasites and, accordingly, the invasion capacity of TcIV metacyclic forms was higher. Gp90 molecules spontaneously released by TcI metacyclic forms inhibited the parasite entry into host cells. TcI parasites exhibited low intracellular replication rate. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the poor capacity of TcI lineage, and to a lesser degree of TcIV parasites, in invading gastric epithelium after oral infection of mice may be associated with the inefficiency of metacyclic forms, in particular of TcI parasites, to migrate through the gastric mucus layer, to invade target epithelial cells and to replicate intracellularly."

One-third of infected patients will develop the cardiac form, which may progress to heart failure (HF). However, the factors that determine disease progression remain unclear. Increased angiotensin II activity is a key player in the pathophysiology of HF. A functional polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with plasma enzyme activity. In CD, ACE inhibitors have beneficial effects supporting the use of this treatment in chagasic cardiomyopathy. Methods: We evaluated the association of ACE I/D polymorphism with HF, performing a case-control study encompassing 343 patients with positive serology for CD staged as non-cardiomyopathy (stage A; 100), mild (stage B1; 144), and severe (stage C; 99) forms of Chagas heart disease. For ACE I/D genotyping by PCR, groups were compared using unconditional logistic regression analysis and adjusted for nongenetic covariates: age, sex, and trypanocidal treatment. Results: A marginal, but not significant (p=0.06) higher prevalence of ACE I/D polymorphism was observed in patients in stage C compared with patients in stage A. Patients in stage C (CD with HF), were compared with patients in stages A and B1 combined into one group (CD without HF); DD genotype/D carriers were prevalent in the HF patients (OR = 2; CI = 1.013.96; p = 0.04). Conclusions: Our results of this cohort study, comprising a population from the Northeast region of Brazil, suggest that ACE I/D polymorphism is more prevalent in the cardiac form of Chagas disease with HF."

Among tested compounds against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi, octadec-9-ynoic acid (1) displayed higher potential with IC50 = 27.6 mu M and a selectivity index (SI) higher than 7. Compounds 2 and 3 showed IC50 of approximately 60 mM while compound 4 was inactive. The lethal action of the compound 1 was investigated using spectrofluorometric techniques to detect ROS content, plasma membrane permeability and plasma membrane potential by flow cytometry. Compound 1 showed no alteration in the production of ROS of treated trypomastigotes and no alteration of the plasma membrane permeability was observed as detected by the fluorescent probe SYTOX-green after 120 min of incubation. However, by using the potential-sensitive fluorescent probe DiSBAC(2)(3), compound 1 caused depolarization of the plasma membrane potential when compared to untreated parasites. Our results demonstrated the anti-T. cruzi effects of compounds 1-3 isolated from flowers of P. macrocarpa and indicated that the lethal effect of compound 1 in T. cruzi could be associated to the plasma membrane disturbance of the parasite.

This study compares the environmental niche spaces of Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma melanica using ecological niche modelling and reports findings on DNA barcoding and wing geometric morphometrics as tools for the identification of these species. Methods: We compared the geographic distribution of the species using generalized linear models fitted to elevation and current data on land surface temperature, vegetation cover and rainfall recorded by earth observation satellites for northeastern Brazil. Additionally, we evaluated nucleotide sequence data from the barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CO1) and wing geometric morphometrics as taxonomic identification tools for T. brasiliensis and T. melanica. Results: The ecological niche models show that the environmental spaces currently occupied by T. brasiliensis and T. melanica are similar although not equivalent, and associated with the caatinga ecosystem. The CO1 sequence analyses based on pair wise genetic distance matrix calculated using Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) evolutionary model, clearly separate the two species, supporting the barcoding gap. Wing size and shape analyses based on seven landmarks of 72 field specimens confirmed consistent differences between T. brasiliensis and T. melanica. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the separation of the two species should be attributed to a factor that does not include the current environmental conditions. However, as the caatinga is a biome that has existed in the area for at least the last 18,000 years, past conditions might have had an influence in the speciation process. The DNA Barcoding approach may be extended to these members of the subfamily Triatominae."

This study assessed the geographic abundance patterns of two vector species of Chagas disease: Triatoma maculata (Erichson, 1848) and Rhodnius pallescens (Barber, 1932) in Latin America. We modeled their potential distribution using the maximum entropy algorithm implemented in Maxent and calculated distances to their niche centroid by fitting a minimum-volume ellipsoid. In addition, to determine which method would accurately explain geographic abundance patterns, we compared the correlation between population abundance and the distance to the ecological niche centroid (DNC) and between population abundance and Maxent environmental suitability. The potential distribution estimated for T. maculata showed that environmental suitability covers a large area, from Panama to Northern Brazil. R. pallescens showed a more restricted potential distribution, with environmental suitability covering mostly the coastal zone of Costa Rica and some areas in Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, northern Colombia, Acre, and Rondonia states in Brazil, as well as a small region of the western Brazilian Amazon. We found a negative slope in the relationship between population abundance and the DNC in both species. R. pallecens has a more extensive potential latitudinal range than previously reported, and the distribution model for T. maculata corroborates previous studies. In addition, population abundance increases according to the niche centroid proximity, indicating that population abundance is limited by the set of scenopoetic variables at coarser scales (non-interactive variables) used to determine the ecological niche. These findings might be used by public health agencies in Latin America to implement actions and support programs for disease prevention and vector control, identifying areas in which to expand entomological surveillance and maintain chemical control, in order to decrease human-vector contact."

It occurs in wild, peridomestic and domestic habitats, with an urban infestation in Boa Vista, the capital of this Brazilian state. The aim of this study was to assess the morphological variability of the T. maculata antennal phenotype in three populations of Roraima State, using the antennal sensilla pattern analyzed under optical microscopy. Methods The number and distribution of four antennal sensilla types (bristles, thin and thick walled trichoidea, and basiconic) of three Brazilian populations of T. maculata from Roraima State were compared. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results The antenna of T. maculata presented the four types of sensilla. According to the density and distribution of the antennal sensilla characteristics, the multivariate analyses showed that the laboratory population is morphologically structured. Urban specimens showed a pronounced phenotypic variability. The main differences were observed in the pedicel segment, and between males and females. Conclusions We determined the antennal phenotype in three Roraima populations of T. maculata. These results support the idea that the patterns of antennal sensilla are sensitive markers for distinct populations in the Triatominae. The infestations of T. maculata in different habitats reinforces the ability of this vector to become adapted to a variety of environments, which, could have eco-epidemiological implications for the T. cruzi transmission that are still not well understood."

Conversely, increased interleukin (IL)-10 serum concentrations have been associated with asymptomatic CD. Cytokines and cytokine-related gene polymorphisms may control cytokine expression and have been proposed to contribute to CCC outcomes. OBJECTIVES We evaluated the association of 13 cytokine-related genes (TGFB: rs8179181, rs8105161, rs1800469; IL10: rs1800890, rs1800871, rs1800896; IFNG: rs2430561; TNF: rs1800629; BAT1: rs3853601; LTA: rs909253, rs2239704; TNFR1: rs767455; TNFR2: rs1061624) with risk and progression of CCC. FINDINGS Four hundred and six seropositive patients from CD endemic areas in the state of Pernambuco, north-eastern Brazil, were classified as non-cardiopathic (A, 110) or cardiopathic (mild, B1, 163; severe, C, 133). We found no evidence of TGFB, IL10, TNF, or TNFR1/2 gene polymorphisms associated with CCC risk or progression. Only BAT1 rs3853601 -22G carriers (B1 vs. C: OR = 0.5; p-value = 0.03) and IFNG rs2430561 +874AT (A vs. C: OR = 0.7; p-value = 0.03; A vs. Bl+C: OR = 0.8; p-value = 0.02) showed a significant association with protection from cardiopathy in a logistic regression analysis with adjustment for gender and ethnicity; however, the association disappeared after performing adjustment for multiple testing. A systematic review of TNF rs1800629 -308G>A publications included five studies for meta-analysis (534 CCC and 472 asymptomatic patients) and showed no consensus in pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates for A allele or A carriers (OR = 1.4 and 1.5; p-values = 0.14 and 0.15, respectively). In CD patients, TNF serum levels were increased, but not affected by the TNF rs1800629 -308A allele.

TL patients may concurrently carry other pathogens, which may influence the clinical outcome of TL. Methodology and principal findings This review focuses on the frequency of TL coinfections in human populations, interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens in animal models and human subjects, and implications of TL coinfections for clinical practice. For the purpose of this review, TL is defined as all forms of cutaneous (localised, disseminated, or diffuse) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, superinfection with skin bacteria, and skin manifestations of visceral leishmaniasis are not included. We searched MEDLINE and other databases and included 73 records: 21 experimental studies in animals and 52 studies about human subjects (mainly cross-sectional and case studies). Several reports describe the frequency of Trypanosoma cruzi coinfection in TL patients in Argentina (about 41%) and the frequency of helminthiasis in TL patients in Brazil (15% to 88%). Different hypotheses have been explored about mechanisms of interaction between different microorganisms, but no clear answers emerge. Such interactions may involve innate immunity coupled with regulatory networks that affect quality and quantity of acquired immune responses. Diagnostic problems may occur when concurrent infections cause similar lesions (e.g., TL and leprosy), when different pathogens are present in the same lesions (e.g., Leishmania and Sporothrix schenckii), or when similarities between phylogenetically close pathogens affect accuracy of diagnostic tests (e.g., serology for leishmaniasis and Chagas disease). Some coinfections (e.g., helminthiasis) appear to reduce the effectiveness of antileishmanial treatment, and drug combinations may cause cumulative adverse effects. Conclusions and significance In patients with TL, coinfection is frequent, it can lead to diagnostic errors and delays, and it can influence the effectiveness and safety of treatment. More research is needed to unravel how coinfections interfere with the pathogenesis of TL."

In this study, we determined the spatiotemporal distribution of triatomine dispersion rates in the Cariri region, Southern Ceara and ascertained the possible association between these rates with socioeconomic and environmental factors. Dispersion rates (number of positive localities/number of searched localities x 100) were analyzed regarding 13 municipalities from the Ceara State, from 2009 to 2013. Socioeconomic and environmental variables collected from national research institutes were associated with the dispersion rates and their local empirical Bayesian estimates.

Significant differences were observed among the municipality means. The highest rates were observed in Antonina do Norte and Potengi. According to the correlation analysis, the proportion between the occupied population and the total population showed a significant negative correlation, as well as the percentage of the population who lives under adequate sanitary conditions. Both, the percentage of revenues from external sources and the percentage of urban households in reforested blocks had a significant positive correlation. Our results show that socioeconomic and environmental variables can be factors that contribute to both, the maintenance and the reduction of the elevated dispersion rates observed in the study area.

In its chronic stage, patients can develop mega-colon, mega-esophagus, and cardiomyopathy. Differences in clinical outcomes may be determined, in part, by the genetic background of the parasite that causes Chagas disease.Trypanosoma cruzihas a high genetic diversity, and each group of strains may elicit specific pathological responses in the host. Conflicting results have been reported in studies using various combinations of mammalian host-T. cruzistrains. We previously profiled the transcriptomic signatures resulting from infection of L6E9 rat myoblasts with four reference strains ofT. cruzi(Brazil, CL, Y, and Tulahuen). The four strains induced similar overall gene expression alterations in the myoblasts, although only 21 genes were equally affected by all strains.Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1(Clcf1) was one of the genes found to be consistently upregulated by the infection with all four strains ofT. cruzi. This cytokine is a member of the interleukin-6 family that binds to glycoprotein 130 receptor and activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which may lead to muscle cell hypertrophy. Another commonly upregulated gene was tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein theta (Ywhaq, 14-3-3 protein Theta), present in the Cell Cycle Pathway. In the present work, we reanalyzed our previous microarray dataset, aiming at understanding in more details the transcriptomic impact that each strain has on JAK/STAT signaling and Cell Cycle pathways. Using Pearson correlation analysis between the expression levels of gene pairs in biological replicas from each pathway, we determined the coordination between such pairs in each experimental condition and the predicted protein interactions between the significantly altered genes by each strain. We found that although these highlighted genes were similarly affected by all four strains, the downstream genes or their interaction partners were not necessarily equally affected, thus reinforcing the idea of the role of parasite background on host cell transcriptome. These new analyses provide further evidence to the mechanistic understanding of how distinctT. cruzistrains lead to diverse remodeling of host cell transcriptome."

This work aimed at the synthesis and the trypanocidal evaluation in vitro and in vivo of six new Bnz analogues (3-8). They were designed by exploring the bioisosteric substitution between the amide group contained in Bnz and the 1,2,3-triazole ring. All the compounds were synthesized in good yields. With the exception of compound 7, the in vitro biological evaluation shows that all Bnz analogues were active against the amastigote form, whereas only compounds 3, 4, 5, and 8 were active against trypomastigote. Compounds 4 and 5 showed the most promising activities in vitro against the form of trypomastigote, being more active than Bnz. In vivo evaluation of compounds, 3-8 showed lower potency and higher toxicity than Bnz. Although the 1,2,3-triazole ring has been described in the literature as an amide bioisostere, its substitution here has reduced the activity of the compounds and made them more toxic. Thus, further molecular optimization could provide novel therapeutic agents for Chagas' disease."

Non-isogenic Swiss albino mice were infected with a small inoculum of the highly virulent and partially resistant to benznidazole Y strain, belonging to T. cruzi discrete typing unit II (DTU-II) that predominates in Atlantic and Central Brazil. DNA from EDTA-blood samples and 10 organs of mice containing high, moderate and low parasite load levels were extracted by a highly used commercial kit and tested in triplicate, showing no disagreements between the two qPCRs. The melting temperature of positive samples was 79.8 degrees C +/- 1 degrees C for satellite-DNA and 78.1 degrees C +/- 1 degrees C for kDNA. DNA from genetically-related parasites such as Leishmania sp. showed no cross-reactions, but the sympatric T. rangeli was detected by both qPCRs, more effectively by kDNA than the satellite system, which required the equivalent of 50 parasites to give a positive result. Samples from infected mice, regardless of the type of biological matrix (blood or organ samples) or the parasite load gave positive results by both qPCRs. The sensitivity of sat-qPCR was 2 x 10(-3) parasite or 240 target copies, and for kDNA, 2 x 10(-4) parasite or 24 target copies. Regarding repeatability and reproducibility, the coefficient of variation (CV) was always < 25% in both assays; linearity of sat-qPCR was 0.991 (+/-0.002) and 0.991 (+/-0.008) for kDNA qPCR. In most collection times, the median Ct values found in blood and organs provided by sat-DNA and kDNA qPCRs were similar.

Methods: The study was conducted by means of questionnaires applied to local authorities and the program beneficiaries. Three municipalities - Ajuricaba, Coronel Barros, and Crissiumal - were visited. Results: A program coordinator from each municipality and 62 individuals from selected households were interviewed.

In the present study, phylogenies inferred using SSU rRNA (small subunit of ribosomal rRNA), gGAPDH (glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and Cytb (cytochrome b) genes strongly supported Tcbat as a monophyletic lineage prevalent in Brazil, Panama and Colombia. Providing strong support for Tcbat, sequences from 37 of 47 nuclear and 12 mitochondria! genes (retrieved from a draft genome of Tcbat) and reference strains of all DTUs available in databanks corroborated Tcbat as an independent DTU. Consistent with previous studies, multilocus analysis of most nuclear genes corroborated the evolution of T. cruzi from bat trypanosomes its divergence into two main phylogenetic lineages: the basal TcII; and the lineage clustering TcIV, the clade comprising TcIII and the sister groups TcI-Tcbat. Most likely, the common ancestor of Tcbat and TcI was a bat trypanosome. However, the results of the present analysis did not support Tcbat as the ancestor of all DTUs. Despite the insights provided by reports of TcIII, TcIV and TcII in bats, including Amazonian bats harbouring TcII, further studies are necessary to understand the roles played by bats in the diversification of all DTUs. We also demonstrated that in addition to value as molecular markers for DTU assignment, Cytb, ITS rDNA and the spliced leader (SL) polymorphic sequences suggest spatially structured populations of Tcbat.

In its chronic phase, progression to cardiomyopathy has high morbidity and mortality. The persistence of a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) provides a similar prognosis to that of a non-diseased population. Benznidazole (BNZ) is the only drug with trypanocidal action available in Brazil. Materials/Methods/Results A group of 310 patients with chronic Chagas disease who had normal ECGs at the first medical visit performed before 2002 were included. There were 263 patients treated with BNZ and 47 untreated. The follow-up period was 19.59 years. Univariate analyses showed that those treated were younger and predominantly male. As many as 79.08% of those treated and 46.81% of those untreated continued with normal electrocardiograms (p < 0.0001). The occurrence of electrocardiographic abnormalities and relevant clinical events (heart failure, stroke, total mortality, and cardiovascular death) was less prevalent in treated patients (p < 0.001, p: 0.022, p: 0.047 respectively). In multivariate analyses, the parasiticide treatment was an independent variable for persistence of a normal ECG pattern, which was an independent variable in the prevention of significant clinical events. The immunofluorescence titers decreased with the parasitological treatment. However, the small number of tests in untreated patients did not allow the correlation of the decrease of these titers with electrocardiographic alterations. Conclusion These data suggest that treatment with benznidazole prevents the occurrence of electrocardiographic alterations. On the other hand, patients who develop ECG abnormalities present with more significant clinical events."

The largest genus is Triatoma, subdivided in several complexes and subcomplexes according to morphology, ecology and genetic features. One of them is the sordida subcomplex, involving four species: Triatoma sordida, T. guasayana, T. garciabesi and T. patagonica. Given the great morphological similarity of these species, their taxonomic identification, evolutionary relationships and population differentiation have been controversial for many years and even today remain under discussion. Methods: We simultaneously analyzed two chromosomal markers, C-heterochromatin distribution and 45S ribosomal genes chromosomal position, of 139 specimens from several sordida subcomplex populations from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay, collected both in nature and from several established insectaries. Our results were compared with COI sequences deposited in GenBank. Results: We recognized five chromosomal taxa with putative hybrids, which each differ in at least one chromosome marker. Most of them present significant differences in their mtDNA sequences. Conclusion: The chromosomal taxa here show a significant chromosome differentiation involving changes in the C-heterochromatin content and in the ribosomal clusters position. This paper identifies several erroneously classified populations by morphological methods, delimits the geographical distribution of each taxon and proposes the existence of a new cryptic species, widely distributed in Argentina. We also suggest that sordida sibling species involve closely related as well as evolutionary distant species.

In univariate and multivariable analyses, the use of Benznidazole (one of the few drugs used for CD therapy) was statistically protective for progression to cardiac, but not to digestive CD forms. These findings emphasize the importance of novel research aimed at developing more effective therapeutic options."

In the Americas, this species transmits the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, responsible for Chagas disease. The presence of T. rubrofasciata in several Asian countries has greatly increased recently. In Vietnam, it is found in large numbers, closely associated with human environments. Although T. rubrofasciata from Asia is not infected with Tryp. cruzi, it carries other parasites such as Trypanosoma lewisi and Trypanosoma conorhini. Reports of bites by T. rubrofasciata have increased significantly in several places of Vietnam, becoming a public health problem as it produces severe anaphylactic reactions. Methods: Specimens of T. rubrofasciata were collected from seven provinces in central Vietnam. We analyzed different biological attributes (life-cycle, starvation resistance, feeding and reproductive capacities) and genetic characteristics (chromosomes and DNA sequences) of T. rubrofasciata from Vietnam and compared them with Brazilian specimens. Natural infection with Tryp. conorhini and Tryp. lewisi were analyzed in a sample of 100 collected insects. Results: Species identification of T. rubrofasciata from central Vietnam was corroborated by genetic markers. Cytogenetic analyses showed that T. rubrofasciata from central Vietnam share the same chromosomal characteristics with individuals from Brazil and Hanoi. DNA sequence analyses of a mitochondrial cytochrome b gene fragment showed little variation between Old and New World specimens. Our study sample, compared with Brazilian individuals, showed a higher survival capacity revealed by a higher hatching rate (98% compared with 80.5%), a larger amount of blood taken in single meal and long-term starvation resistance. Furthermore, this species had a high natural rate of infection with Tryp. conorhini (46%) and Tryp. lewisi (27%). Conclusions: For T. rubrofasciata of Vietnam, a high rate of fecundity throughout the year, a high capacity for starvation, and its occurrence in synanthropic environments of urban areas with a high availability of food sources are risk factors to be taken into account by vector control campaigns. The several allergic reactions caused by their bites and their high infection with Tryp. lewisi highlight the need to implement specific control programmes for T. rubrofasciata in Vietnam."

METHODS We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized study involving 2854 patients with Chagas' cardiomyopathy who received benznidazole or placebo for up to 80 days and were followed for a mean of 5.4 years. The primary outcome in the time-to-event analysis was the first event of any of the components of the composite outcome of death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular tachycardia, insertion of a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, cardiac transplantation, new heart failure, stroke, or other thromboembolic event. RESULTS The primary outcome occurred in 394 patients (27.5%) in the benznidazole group and in 414 (29.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.07; P = 0.31). At baseline, a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay was performed on blood samples obtained from 1896 patients; 60.5% had positive results for Trypanosoma cruzi on PCR. The rates of conversion to negative PCR results (PCR conversion) were 66.2% in the benznidazole group and 33.5% in the placebo group at the end of treatment, 55.4% and 35.3%, respectively, at 2 years, and 46.7% and 33.1%, respectively, at 5 years or more (P<0.001 for all comparisons). The effect of treatment on PCR conversion varied according to geographic region: in Brazil, the odds ratio for PCR conversion was 3.03 (95% CI, 2.12 to 4.34) at 2 years and 1.87 (95% CI, 1.33 to 2.63) at 5 or more years; in Colombia and El Salvador, the odds ratio was 1.33 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.98) at 2 years and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.45) at 5 or more years; and in Argentina and Bolivia, the odds ratio was 2.63 (95% CI, 1.89 to 3.66) at 2 years and 2.79 (95% CI, 1.99 to 3.92) at 5 or more years (P<0.001 for interaction). However, the rates of PCR conversion did not correspond to effects on clinical outcome (P = 0.16 for interaction).

Methods: Bibliographic records of research publications indexed by WoS were downloaded based on a broad search of related terms. The authors compared the growth of literature by continent using 5 year increments, conducted a citation and co-authorship analysis by country, and a keyword analysis by publication using the scientometric visualization software VOSviewer. Results: The trypanosomiasis research literature has seen more than a fourfold annual increase in production over the study period. Contributions by authors affiliated with European and South American countries proportionately account for the most research literature. The United States and Brazil, however, occupy central roles for citations and as national contributors to the literature. The terms 'trypanosomiasis cruzi' and 'chagas disease' have become more prominent, reflecting the regional growth of research from South America. Interpretation and conclusion: Relative contributions from regions where the disease is prevalent show mixed developments. Contributions by African authors have declined proportionately to other areas of the world. However, South American contributions have increased during the study period. The contributing countries to the literature do not necessarily represent regions in which the diseases are prevalent. The same is true of the citation relationships, where European and North American contributions are more frequently cited. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

In the Amazonas state, five outbreaks of acute CD have been registered since 2004. The cardiac manifestations in these cases may be characterized by diffuse myocarditis, with alteration in the electrocardiogram (ECG) and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Objective: To perform a cardiac evaluation in autochthonous patients in the acute phase and at least one year after submitted to treatment for acute CD and evaluate the demographic variables associated with the presence of cardiac alterations. Methods: We evaluated patients diagnosed with acute CD through direct parasitological or serological (IgM) methods from 2007 to 2015. These patients were treated with benznidazole and underwent ECG and TTE before and after treatment. We assumed a confidence interval of 95% (CI 95%, p < 0.05) for all variables analyzed. Results: We observed 63 cases of an acute CD in which oral transmission corresponded to 75%. Cardiac alterations were found in 33% of the cases, with a greater frequency of ventricular repolarization alteration (13%), followed by pericardial effusion (10%) and right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block (2%). The follow-up occurred in 48 patients with ECG and 25 with TTE for a mean period of 15.5 +/- 4.1 months after treatment. Of these, 8% presented normalization of the cardiac alterations in ECG, 62.5% remained with the normal exams. All of the patients presented normal results in TTE in the post-treatment period. As for the demographic variables, isolated cases presented more cardiac alterations than outbreaks (p = 0.044) as well as cases from Central Amazonas mesoregion (p = 0.020). Conclusions: Although cardiac alterations have not been frequent in most of the studied population, a continuous evaluation of the clinical-epidemiological dynamics of the disease in the region is necessary in order to establish preventive measures."

Both are members of the T. brasiliensis species complex. The former is the most important Chagas disease vector in the northeastern region of Brazil. To date, no transmission via T. melanica has been recorded. Immature insects exhibited distinct intermoult periods without a direct relationship to a given species. Females of T. brasiliensis consumed an average of 1.9 times more meals (mean = 12.92 vs 6.63) and survived for a shorter period (mean = 330.8 days) than T. melanica (mean = 365.2 days), probably due to the cost of reproduction (all significant at P<0.05). These data support the idea that T. brasiliensis is more adapted to lab conditions and is more able to infest domiciles than T. melanica. We also found significant distinctions in other features between these species, such as the elapsed time without eating before molting, which was higher for the second, third, and fifth nymph stages of T. melanica. Regarding features analyzed related to vector capacity, insects of all life stages of both species were considered competent to transmit Trypanosoma cruzi because they needed many feedings (mean = 1.5-3.82) to moult and because a high proportion (>39%) of insects defecated rapidly (<30 s) after feeding. Overall, results highlight the need to extend vector surveillance to T. melanica."

This paper describes social factors related to use of prenatal care in Ecuador. Methods. In 2011 and 2012, participant clinical history and interview information was analyzed from a national probability sample of 5 998 women presenting for delivery or miscarriage services in 15 healthcare facilities in Ecuador, to estimate prevalence of HIV, syphilis, and Chagas disease, and prenatal care coverage. Results. The study found that 94.1% of women had attended at least one prenatal visit, but that attendance at no less than four visits was 73.1%. Furthermore, lower educational level, greater number of pregnancies, occupation in the agriculture or livestock sector, and membership in ethnic indigenous, Afro-Ecuadorian, or other minority groups were factors associated with lack of use (no prenatal visits) or insufficient use of prenatal care (fewer than four visits or first visit at > 20 weeks gestation) in Ecuador.

Locally run systems often deal with highly diverse native-vector faunas-plus, in some areas, domestic populations of non-native species. Flexible entomological-risk indicators that cover native and non-native vectors and can support local decision-making are therefore needed. Methods: We present a local-scale entomological-risk score (""TriatoScore"") that leverages and builds upon information on the ecology-behavior and distribution-biogeography of individual triatomine bug species. We illustrate our approach by calculating TriatoScores for the 417 municipalities of Bahia state, Brazil. For this, we (i) listed all triatomine bug species recorded statewide; (ii) derived a ""species relevance score"" reflecting whether each species is native/non-native and, if native, whether/how often it invades/colonizes dwellings; (iii) mapped each species' presence by municipality; (iv) for native vectors, weighted presence by the proportion of municipal territory within ecoregions occupied by each species; (v) multiplied ""species relevance score"" x ""weighted presence"" to get species-specific ""weighted scores""; and (vi) summed ""weighted scores"" across species to get municipal TriatoScores. Using standardized TriatoScores, we then grouped municipalities into high/moderate/low entomological-risk strata. Results: TriatoScores were higher in municipalities dominated by dry-to-semiarid ecoregions than in those dominated by savanna-grassland or, especially, moist-forest ecoregions. Bahia's native triatomines can maintain high to moderate risk of vector-borne Chagas disease in 318 (76.3%) municipalities. Historical elimination of Triatoma infestans from 125 municipalities reduced TriatoScores by similar to 27% (range, 20-44%); eight municipalities reported T. infestans since Bahia was certified free of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission by this non-native species. Entomological-risk strata based on TriatoScores agreed well with Bahia's official disease-risk strata, but TriatoScores suggest that the official classification likely underestimates risk in 42 municipalities. Of 152 municipalities failing to report triatomines in 2006-2019, two and 71 had TriatoScores corresponding to, respectively, high and moderate entomological risk. Conclusions: TriatoScore can help control-surveillance managers to flexibly assess and stratify the entomological risk of Chagas disease at operationally relevant scales. Integrating eco-epidemiological, demographic, socioeconomic, or operational data (on, e.g., local-scale dwelling-infestation or vector-infection frequencies, land-use change and urbanization, housing conditions, poverty, or the functioning of control-surveillance systems) is also straightforward. TriatoScore may thus become a useful addition to the triatomine bug control-surveillance toolbox."

The first case of Chagas disease by vectorial transmission was recorded in 2019 in a rural area in Rondo<SIC>nia, reinforcing the need for entomological surveillance. Hence, our goal was to estimate the abundance of Rhodnius spp. in palm trees located in rural and periurban areas and in Brazil-Bolivia border regions, perform domiciliary searches, and check for possible associations between triatomines and the presence/ absence of palm-inhabiting fauna and outdoor farming, domestic animals, and buildings. The sampling took place in five municipalities of Rondo<SIC>nia in 2014 (June to August) and 2015 (April to June). Triatomines were collected by active searches during the selective pruning of palm tree crowns. Domiciliary inspections lasted from 30 to 60 min. A set of captured triatomines was analyzed for Trypanosoma cruzi and T. rangeli infection by PCR. Overall, 496 insects were captured during sampling of 150 palms in rural areas and 150 in periurban areas. No triatomine was found during active searches of 59 dwelling either indoors or outdoors. The majority of triatomines caught in the palm trees were identified as Rhodnius robustus (98.6%), and seven specimens were R. pictipes. Triatomine infestation was observed in only 20% of the sampled palms (61/300) in the vicinity of 26/ 59 households. Nearly half of the infested palm trees had only one or two triatomines, and few palms presented more than 15 triatomines. The municipality of Buritis had the highest triatomine abundance and percentage of infested palms; however, the highest triatomine density per infested palm was observed in Alvorada D'Oeste, where a quarter of the palms were infested. Ants, arachnids, termites, reptiles, and rodents were frequently found in palm trees. Dogs were the predominant domestic animals in households, whereas hens and cattle were the main farming animals. Model estimates showed that the number of triatomines was affected by the presence of henhouses and varied strongly between localities. No relationships were detected between the average number of triatomines and palm fauna and/or palm height. Overall, approximately half of the triatomines were infected with T. cruzi (51.4%) and/or T. rangeli (47.2%), reinforcing the need for continuous entomological surveillance and implementation of community-based approaches because the Brazilian state of Rondo<SIC>nia borders areas experiencing reinfestation by domiciled species and potential colonization of animal shelters by triatomines."

We used mitochondrial rDNA (16S), nuclear ribosomal RNA (28S) and wingless (Wg) sequences to perform phylogenetic analysis to derive trees based on parsimony and maximum likelihood. Nucleotide sequences were used in molecular-clock analyses to estimate time divergence between species of Rhodniini. The potential distribution of each species was modeled and compared with Kappa statistic. Multivariate niches with bioclimatic variables were used to describe differences between the species using discriminant analysis. The results of this study indicate that the Rhodniini originated 17.91 Mya ago. Rhodnius domesticus is the oldest species having its origin at 9.13 Mya. Rhodniini are closely related to Salyavatinae that are specialist termite predators and diverged from this subfamily 30.43 Mya. Most species are clearly allopatric and have distinct bioclimatic niches. The colonization of bromeliads, palms trees and bird nests represent important events for the speciation of these taxa. The hematophagous habit can be described as a scenario where Rhodniini’s ancestor could be pre-adapted for the invasion of bromeliads, palm trees, and bird nests where they would find significant water availability and thermal damping. These environments are widely used by vertebrate inquilines that would be the source of food for the species of Rhodniini.

Objective: To investigate the antiprotozoal activity of hexane and EtOH extracts from the 'carnauba' wax as well as from the isolated compounds from the bioactive extracts. Material and methods: Two different samples of 'carnauba' (C. prunifera) waxes-types 1 and 4-were individually extracted using hexane (EH) and EtOH (EE). Aliquots of hexane (type 1-EH-1 and EH-4) and EtOH (type 4-EE-1 and EE-4) extracts were tested against promastigote (2-200 mu g/mL in DMSO during 48 h at 24 degrees C) and amastigote (3-150 mu g/mL in DMSO during 120 h at 37 degrees C) forms of Leishmania infantum as well as against trypomastigote (3-150 mu g/mL in DMSO during 24 h at 37 degrees C) forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Bioactive extracts EH-1 and EE-4 were subjected to a bioactivity-guided fractionation to afford three dammarane-type triterpenoids (1-3). The in vitro antiprotozoal activities of the obtained compounds were evaluated as described above. Additionally, the cytotoxicity activity of compounds 1-3 against mammalian conjunctive cells (NCTC-2-200 mu g/mL in DMSO during 48 h at 37 degrees C) was determined. Results: From the bioactive hexane and EtOH extracts from the 'carnauba' (C. prunifera) wax, were isolated three dammarane-type triterpenoids: (24R*)-methyldammar-25-ene-3 beta, 20-diol (carnaubadiol, 1), (24R*)-methyldammara-20,25-dien-3-one (2) and (24R*)-methyldammara-20,25-dien-3 alpha-ol (3). These compounds were identified based on the analysis of NMR and MS spectroscopic data. Compounds 1-3 were effective against the intracellular amastigotes of L. infantum, with IC50 values ranging from 8 to 52 mu M, while compounds 1 and 3 displayed activity against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi with IC50 values of 15 and 35 mu M, respectively. The mammalian cytotoxicity assay demonstrated no damage to NCTC conjunctive cells up to 200 mu M, except for compound 1, which demonstrated a CC50 value of 34 mu M. Conclusion: Based on the results, it was possible to conclude that the detected antiprotozoal bioactivity of 'carnauba' (C. prunifera) wax extracts could be related to the presence of the natural dammarane triterpenoid derivatives. The results suggested that these compounds could be used as promising scaffolds for drug design studies for leishmaniasis and Chagas disease."

The monitoring and control of congenital Chagas disease in the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta is a public health necessity that demands urgent and effective interventions."

Triatomines were obtained by community-based entomological surveillance. Spatial patterns of infestation were analysed by Ripley's K function and Kernel density estimator. Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land cover derived from satellite imagery were compared between infested and uninfested areas. A total of 140 adults of four species were captured (100 Triatoma vitticeps, 25 Panstrongylus geniculatus, 8 Panstrongylus megistus, and 7 Triatoma arthurneivai specimens). In total, 87.9% were captured within domiciles. Infection by trypanosomes was observed in 19.6% of 107 examined insects. The spatial distributions of T. vitticeps, P. geniculatus, T. arthurneivai, and trypanosome-positive triatomines were clustered, occurring mainly in peripheral areas. NDVI values were statistically higher in areas infested by T. vitticeps and P. geniculatus. Buildings infested by these species were located closer to open fields, whereas infestations of P. megistus and T. arthurneivai were closer to bare soil. Human occupation and modification of natural areas may be involved in triatomine invasion, exposing the population to these vectors."

Method of studyPlacental tissue explants were infected ex vivo with each parasite, TLRs protein expression, cytokine profile and parasite infection were determined by Western blotting, ELISA and qPCR. ResultsTrypanosoma cruzi and Toxoplasma gondii infection is related to TLR-2 and TLR-4/TLR-9, respectively. Trypanosoma cruzi elicits an increase in TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 cytokine secretion whereas T.gondii only increases the secretion of IL-8.

Using findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD, 2016), we present years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life years due to Chagas disease in Brazil, by sex, age group, and Brazilian states, from 1990 to 2016. Results are reported in absolute numbers and age-standardized rates (per 100,000 population) with 95% uncertainty intervals. In 2016, 141,640 disability-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty intervals: 129,065-155,941) due to Chagas disease were estimated in Brazil, with a relative reduction of 36.7% compared with 1990 (223,879 disability-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty intervals: 209,372-238,591)). Age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rates declined at the national level (-69.7%) and in all Brazilian states between 1990 and 2016, but with different regional patterns. The decrease in the disability-adjusted life year rates was driven primarily by a consistent reduction in the years of life lost rates, the main component of total disability-adjusted life years for Chagas disease. The highest fatal and non-fatal burden due to Chagas disease was observed among males, the elderly, and in those Brazilian states encompassing important endemic areas for vector transmission in the past. Despite the consistent reduction in its burden during the period, Chagas disease is still an important and neglected cause of health lost due to premature mortality and disability in Brazil. Efforts should be made to maintain the political interest and sustainability of surveillance and control actions for Chagas disease, prevent the risk of re-emergence of vector transmission in endemic areas, and provide health care to chronically infected individuals, including early diagnosis and treatment interventions.

METHODS The parasites were isolated and a growth curve was performed in NNN and Schneider’s media containing 10% foetal bovine serum. Parasite morphology was evaluated via light microscopy on Giemsa-stained culture smears, as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Molecular taxonomy was based on a partial region (737-bp) of the small subunit (18S) ribosomal RNA gene and 708 bp of the nuclear marker, glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) genes. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods were used to perform a species coalescent analysis and to generate individual and concatenated gene trees. Divergence times among species that belong to the T. cruzi clade were also inferred. FINDINGS In vitro growth curves demonstrated a very short log phase, achieving a maximum growth rate at day 3 followed by a sharp decline. Only epimastigote forms were observed under light and scanning microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed structures typical to Trypanosoma spp., except one structure that presented as single-membraned, usually grouped in stacks of three or four. Phylogeography analyses confirmed the distinct species status of T. janseni n. sp. within the T. cruzi clade. Trypanosoma janseni n. sp. clusters with T. wauwau in a well-supported clade, which is exclusive and monophyletic. The separation of the South American T. wauwau + T. janseni coincides with the separation of the Southern Super Continent.

Both azadirachtin treatment and ecdysone supplementation avoid the development of both outer epicuticle and wax layer. Oral therapy with ecdysone partially reversed the altered organization and induce the development of the four main rectal cuticle layers.

This study compares mortality rates among blood donors seropositive for Chagas disease and negative controls in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methodology/principal findings This is a retrospective cohort study of blood donors from 1996 to 2000: 2842 seropositive and 5684 seronegative for Chagas disease. Death status was ascertained by performing probabilistic record linkage (RL) with the Brazil national mortality information system (SIM). RL was assessed in a previous validation study. Cox Regression was used to derive hazard ratios (HR), adjusting for confounders. RL identified 159 deaths among the 2842 seropositive blood donors (5.6%) and 103 deaths among the 5684 seronegative (1.8%). Out of the 159 deaths among seropositive donors, 26 had the 10th International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) indicating Chagas disease as the underlying cause of death (B57.0/B57.5), 23 had ICD-10 codes (I42.0/I42.2/I47.0/I47.2/I49.0/I50.0/I50.1/I50.9/I51.7) indicating cardiac abnormalities possibly related to Chagas disease listed as an underlying or associated cause of death, with the others having no mention of Chagas disease in part I of the death certificate. Donors seropositive for Chagas disease had a 2.3 times higher risk of death due to all causes (95% Confidence Interval (95% CI), 1.8-3.0) than seronegative donors. When considering deaths due to Chagas disease or those that had underlying causes of cardiac abnormalities related to Chagas disease, seropositive donors had a risk of death 17.9 (95% CI, 6.3-50.8) times greater than seronegative donors.

In 2012 Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) started an intervention in Bergamo province, where many people of Latin American origin (PLAO) are resident. A new model-of-care for CD, initiated by Centre for Tropical Diseases of Sacro Cuore Hospital, Negrar (CTD), the NGO OIKOS and the Bolivian community since 2009 in the same area, was endorsed. Hereby, we aim to describe the prevalence of CD and the treatment management outcomes among PLAO screened from 1st June 2012 to 30th June 2013. Methods Retrospective cohort study using routine program data. Screening sessions were done in Bergamo at OIKOS outpatient service and serological confirmation, staging and treatment for CD was offered at the CTD. MSF provided health education on CD, awareness generation prior to screening days, pre-test and post-test counselling through cultural mediators of Latin American origin. Results Of 1305 PLAO screened, 223(17%) had CD. Among 210 patients eligible for treatment, 102 (49%) were lost-to-follow-up before treatment. The median delay from diagnosis to treatment was 4 months (range 0.7-16.6 months). Among 108 started on treatment, 63(58%) completed treatment, 36(33%) interrupted treatment, (33 for drug side-effects, two for patients decision and one due to pregnancy), 6(6%) were lost-to-follow-up and 3(3%) were on treatment at study censuring. Conclusion In this first study focusing on process of care for CD in Italy, less than 30% of patients completed treatment with drop-outs along the cascade of care. There is an urgent need to involve affected communities and local regional health authorities to take part to this model-of-care, adapting it to the local epidemiology.

In endemic settings, continued transmission over time has resulted in increasing prevalence of both asymptomatic infection and cardiomyopathy with increasing age. Latin America has made substantial progress towards Chagas disease control. Although several epidemiological studies have been conducted, information regarding epidemiology and distribution of IS in Chagas disease is still lacking.MethodsWe retrospectively studied the electronic medical record data of all patients with both IS and Chagas disease admitted at SARAH Hospitals across Brazil from 2009 to 2013 to make epidemiological quantifications and statistical inferences.ResultsA total of 279 patients with Chagas disease and IS were analyzed from 7729 IS-related admissions, indicating a median prevalence of 3.6% of Chagas disease in IS patients in our cohort. Mean age was 60 years, with female predominance (65%). Most of the cases were from Bahia (61%), followed by Minas Gerais (19%) and Goias (9.7%). Low-income cities, with decreased access to healthcare, showed the highest number of cases. Distribution of vascular risk factors and outcome after stroke differed among the units. According to current guidelines, secondary prevention was inadequate in 60% of patients.ConclusionsChagas disease was common in IS patients; prevalence of concurrent Chagas disease and IS was high in some regions of the country. However, the infection frequency seems to be reduced in the last few years. Public health issues for improving the treatment of Chagas disease and IS are urgently needed."

However, data regarding the incidence and distribution of acute Chagas disease cases in the State of Pernambuco are unavailable in the literature. Methods: A geographical information system was used to delineate the spatiotemporal distribution profile of the cases from 2002 to 2013 in 185 municipalities of Pernambuco based on the municipality where notification occurred. The results were presented in digital maps generated by the TerraView software (INPE). Results: A total of 302 cases of acute disease were recorded in 37.8% of the municipalities, for a total of 0.13 cases per 1,000,000 inhabitants per year. Out of the 302 cases, 99.3% were reported between 2002 and 2006. The most affected municipalities were Carnaubeira da Penha, Mirandiba and Terra Nova. The risk maps showed a significant decrease in the number of notifications and a concentration of cases in the Midwest region. Conclusions: This study highlights a significant decrease in new cases of acute Chagas disease in Pernambuco starting in 2006 when Brazil received an international certification for the interruption of vectorial transmission by Triatoma infestans. However, control strategies should still be encouraged because other triatomine species can also transmit the parasite; moreover, other transmission modes must not be neglected."

Nowadays, the available aetiological treatments for leishmaniasis have variable effectiveness and several problems such as serious side effects, toxicity, high cost and an increasing number of resistance cases. Thus, there is an urgent need for safe, oral and cost-effective drugs for leishmaniases. Previously, our group has shown the effect of the ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors on Leishmania amazonensis. Herein, we showed the effect of ravuconazole against L. amazonensis; ravuconazole is a second-generation triazole antifungal drug that has good bioavailability after oral administration and a long terminal half-life in humans, a broad activity spectrum, high effectiveness in treatment of mycosis and negligible side effects. Methods: Several methodologies were used: cell culture, fluorescence and electron microscopy, high-resolution capillary GC coupled with MS, fluorimetry and flow cytometry. Results: Our results showed that ravuconazole was able to inhibit the proliferation of L. amazonensis promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes in vitro, with single-digit to sub-micromolar IC50 values, causing several alterations in the morphology, ultrastructure, cell viability and physiology of the parasites. The mitochondrion was significantly affected by the treatment, resulting in a collapse of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential that consequently led to inhibition of ATP production, combined with an increase in reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide production; by transmission electron microscopy, the organelle displayed a completely altered ultrastructure. The treatment changed the lipid profile, showing a profound depletion of the 14-desmethyl endogenous sterol pool. Conclusions: These results suggest that ravuconazole could be an alternative option for the treatment of leishmaniasis."

The DNA sequences of approximately 600 base pairs of the 18S rRNA gene were obtained for three samples with 99% identity with T. minasense sequence, forming a cluster in the phylogenetic tree and corroborating morphometric analysis. Trypanosoma minasense is a highly specific parasite to non-human primates considered as non-pathogenic. There is no evidence of infection in humans and these parasite findings from invasive marmosets do not support additional risks for the native species."

In order to prevent vertical transmission and improve the prognosis of the disease, it is important to make an early diagnosis. And to develop strategies that improve access to diagnosis, it is important to know the factors that most influence the decision of the population to know their serological status. For this reason, this study uses Andersen's Behavioural Model and its proposed strategies to explore the health behaviours of Bolivian population. Methods Twenty-three interviews, two focus groups, and two triangular groups were performed with Bolivian men and women, involving a total of 39 participants. In addition, four interviews were conducted with key informants in contact with Bolivian population to delve into possible strategies to improve the Chagas diagnosis. Results The most relevant facts for the decision to being diagnosed pointed out by participants were having relatives who were sick or deceased from Chagas disease or, for men, having their pregnant wife with a positive result. After living in Spain more than ten years, population at risk no longer feels identified with their former rural origin and the vector. Moreover, their knowledge and awareness about diagnosis and treatment still remains low, especially in younger people. Limitations on access to healthcare professionals and services were also mentioned, and proposed strategies focused on eliminating these barriers and educating the population in preventive behaviours. Conclusions Based on Andersen's Behavioural Model, the results obtained regarding the factors that most influence the decision to carry out Chagas diagnosis provide information that could help to develop strategies to improve access to health services and modify health behaviours related to Chagas screening."

This paper outlines the study and baseline characteristics of the participants. Participants The study is being conducted in 21 municipalities of the northern part of Minas Gerais State in Brazil, and includes a follow-up of 2years. The baseline evaluation included collection of sociodemographic information, social determinants of health, health-related behaviours, comorbidities, medicines in use, history of previous treatment for Chagas disease, functional class, quality of life, blood sample collection, and ECG. Patients were mostly female, aged 50-74years, with low family income and educational level, with known Chagas disease for >10years; 46% presented with functional class >II. Previous use of benznidazole was reported by 25.2% and permanent use of pacemaker by 6.2%. Almost half of the patients presented with high blood cholesterol and hypertension, and one-third of them had diabetes mellitus. N-terminal of the prohormone BNP (NT-ProBNP) level was >300pg/mL in 30% of the sample. Findings to date Clinical and laboratory markers predictive of severe and progressive Chagas disease were identified as high NT-ProBNP levels, as well as symptoms of advanced heart failure. These results confirm the important residual morbidity of Chagas disease in the remote areas, thus supporting political decisions that should prioritise in addition to epidemiological surveillance the medical treatment of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy in the coming years. The SAo Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical Medicine Research Center (SaMi-Trop) represents a major challenge for focused research in neglected diseases, with knowledge that can be applied in primary healthcare. Future plans We will continue following this patients' cohort to provide relevant information about the development and progression of Chagas disease in remotes areas, with social and economic inequalities.

Although stroke is known to occur in these patients, an accurate estimate of stroke incidence is lacking. We aimed to determine the incidence of stroke and death in patients with HF, comparing Chagas and non-Chagas etiologies. Methods: Cohort of stroke-free patients with HF (Framingham criteria) followed in a university-based outpatient clinic in Brazil. Baseline characteristics included sociodemographic, risk factor assessment, echocardiographic and electrocardiographic findings. Chagas disease was defined by appropriate serologic tests. Cause-specific Cox regression was used to search for predictors of stroke or death as separate outcomes. Results: We studied 565 patients with HF between January 2003 and December 2018, mean age 54.3 +/- 12.9 years, 305 (54.0%) females, 271/535 (50.7%) with Chagas disease. Chagas patients were older (55.5 vs. 53.1 years), more frequently women (60.5% vs. 47.3%), less frequently harbored coronary artery disease (14.5% vs. 34.1%) when compared to non-Chagas patients. Echocardiography showed more severe disease among non-Chagas patients [median left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) 37.3% vs. 47.0%]. Over a mean 42.9 (+/- 34.4) months, we followed 404 (71.5%) patients, completing 1442 patient-years of follow-up. Stroke incidence was higher in Chagas when compared to non-Chagas patients (20.2 vs. 13.9 events per 1000 patient-years), while death rate was similar (41.6 vs. 43.1 deaths per 1000 patient-years). In the multivariable analysis for stroke outcome adjusted for LVEF and arrhythmias, cause-specific hazard ratio (CSHR) for Chagas was 2.54 (95% confidence interval 1.01-6.42, p = 0.048). Chagas disease was also associated with increased risk of death (CSHR 1.83; 95% confidence interval 1.04-3.24, p = 0.037). Conclusion: Chagas disease is associated with increased risk of stroke and death when compared to other etiologies of HF, independently of HF severity or cardiac arrhythmias, suggesting other factors contribute to increased stroke risk and mortality in Chagas disease. Early prevention and treatment of Chagas disease is imperative to reduce a later risk of stroke in endemic areas."

Transduction of uterine arteries in normal and FGR animal models using an adenovirus (Ad) encoding VEGF isoforms increases UBF and improves fetal growth in utero. Understanding potential adverse consequences of this therapy before first-in-woman clinical application is essential. The aims of this study were to determine whether Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C (1) transfers across the human placental barrier and (2) affects human placental morphology, permeability and primary indicators of placental function, and trophoblast integrity. Villous explants from normal term human placentas were treated with Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C (5x10(7-10) virus particles [vp]/mL), or virus formulation buffer (FB). Villous structural integrity (hematoxylin and eosin staining) and tissue accessibility (LacZ immunostaining) were determined. Markers of endocrine function (human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] secretion) and cell death (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] release) were assayed. Lobules from normal and FGR pregnancies underwent ex vivo dual perfusion with exposure to 5x10(10) vp/mL Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C or FB. Perfusion resistance, para-cellular permeability, hCG, alkaline phosphatase, and LDH release were measured. Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C transfer across the placental barrier was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in DNA extracted from fetal-side venous perfusate, and by immunohistochemistry in fixed tissue. Villous explant structural integrity and hCG secretion was maintained at all Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C doses. Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C perfusion revealed no effect on placental permeability, fetoplacental vascular resistance, hCG secretion, or alkaline phosphatase release, but there was a minor elevation in maternal-side LDH release. Viral vector tissue access in both explant and perfused models was minimal, and the vector was rarely detected in the fetal venous perfusate and at low titer. Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C did not markedly affect human placental integrity and function in vitro. There was limited tissue access and transfer of vector across the placental barrier. Except for a minor elevation in LDH release, these test data did not reveal any toxic effects of Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C on the human placenta."

Out of the NTDs prioritized by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, four parasitic infections require mandatory notification: acute Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, malaria, and schistosomiasis. Data on the behaviour of these NTDs in the young population are currently limited. This study seeks to analyse the epidemiological aspects of these parasitic infections in children and adolescents in Brazil. Methods: A retrospective exploratory ecological study was conducted. A spatial analysis of the cases reported between 2009 and 2013 in individuals aged between 0 and 19 years that were notified through the Health Notification Aggravation Information System (SINAN) was performed. Results: In total, 64,567 cases of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, malaria, schistosomiasis, and acute Chagas disease were recorded in the SINAN database, representing a rate of 20.15 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The average age of the cases was 12.2 years and 62.32% were male. Four hundred and three deaths related to these obligatorily reported parasites were recorded, indicating a case fatality rate of 0.62%. Visceral leishmaniasis and acute Chagas disease had the highest rates of lethality. A heterogeneous spatial distribution of the studied parasites was observed. Conclusions: The number of cases and the lethality rate described in this study show that these diseases still represent a serious problem for public health in Brazil.

Methods: The narrative was based on information provided by key actors that were part of the different stages of the process, built on contextual axes based on participants' reflections about the establishment of the most accurate and coherent notification mechanisms. Results: The notification policy addressed the absence of historical data from patients in the state Chagas program, an increase in cases identified through serology, and weaknesses in vector control. Two key challenges involved human resources capacity and dissemination to public agencies and health care workers. Effective training and communication processes were key ingredients for successful implementation. Conclusions: The lack of public health measures aimed at the epidemiological surveillance of chronic Chagas cases constitutes a significant barrier for patients to access appropriate diagnosis, management and follow-up, and hampers the planning of necessary activities within health systems. The implementation of the notification policy in Goias allows authorities to determine the real magnitude of Chagas disease in the population, so that an appropriate public health response can be mounted to meet the needs of affected people, thereby ending the epidemiological silence of Chagas disease."

In the present work, we provide an explicit evaluation for this assumption. Employing species distribution models and epidemiological data for Chagas disease in Brazilian territory, our results show that species richness is a poor predictor for the observed pattern of Chagas disease occurrence.

Methods The techniques of the indirect immunofluorescence reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect reagent samples for Chagas disease and estimate its prevalence in the rural population. Blood samples were collected on filter paper through digital and venipuncture. Blood samples with reactive or indeterminate results were re-evaluated and subjected to the test by ELISA. Results In total, 763 blood samples were analysed from 161 residences of 18 rural communities, collected in residents aged between 2 and 92 years. In the indirect immunofluorescence reaction technique, 44 (5.8%) of the results were positive, being 40 (5.2%) confirmed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Among the communities surveyed, we observed reactive cases in 15 of them, these cases being distributed, according to the age group, as follows: 1 case from 0 to 10 years; 13 cases from 11 to 60 years old; and 30 cases over 61 years.

The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiparasitic, and cytotoxic effects of extracts of red, green, and brown propolis from different regions of Brazil, obtained by ethanolic and supercritical extraction methods. We found that propolis extracts obtained by both these methods showed concentration-dependent antioxidant activity. The extracts obtained by ethanolic extraction showed higher antioxidant activity than that shown by the extracts obtained by supercritical extraction. Ethanolic extracts of red propolis exhibited up to 98% of the maximum antioxidant activity at the highest extract concentration. Red propolis extracts obtained by ethanolic and supercritical methods showed the highest levels of antimicrobial activity against several bacteria. Most extracts demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. None of the extracts analyzed showed activity against Escherichia coli or Candida albicans. An inhibitory effect of all tested ethanolic extracts on the growth of Trypanosoma cruzi Y strain epimastigotes was observed in the first 24 h. However, after 96 h, a persistent inhibitory effect was detected only for red propolis samples. Only ethanolic extracts of red propolis samples R01Et.B2 and R02Et.B2 showed a cytotoxic effect against all four cancer cell lines tested (HL-60, HCT-116, OVCAR-8, and SF-295), indicating that red propolis extracts have great cytotoxic potential. The biological effects of ethanolic extracts of red propolis revealed in the present study suggest that red propolis can be a potential alternative therapeutic treatment against Chagas disease and some types of cancer, although high activity of red propolis in vitro needs to be confirmed by future in vivo investigations."

In this study, we aimed to assess the occurrence of triatomine species and the natural T cruzi infection in the Guaribas Valley territory', an endemic region for Chagas disease in northeastern Brazil. Methods: Insects were actively captured from July 2017 to October 2019 in the intra- and peridomiciles of 16 municipalities of the Guaribas Valley territory, in the southeast area of Piaui state. Triatomine species were identified following a taxonomic key, and natural infection was investigated through insects' fresh feces exams. Results: A total of 430 triatomines were collected, including 211 nymphs and 219 adults. Of all collected specimens, 39 (9.1%) were from the intradomiciles and 391 (90.9%) from peridomiciles. Nine species, including two subspecies, could be identified: Triatoma brasiliensis brasiliensis, T. brasiliensis macromelasoma, T. pseudomaculata, T. sordida, T. juazeirensis, T. melanocephala, Panstrongylus lutzi, Rhodnius domesticus, R. nasutus, and R. robustus.

The International Federation of Associations of People Affected by CD - FINDECHAGAS, created in 2010 with the input of the Americas, Europe and the Western Pacific, counts as one of the main responses to the globalisation of CD. Despite all the obstacles and difficulties encountered, the Federation has thrived, grown, and matured.

The clinical evaluation of acute Chagas disease (ACD) has been a challenge since it can progress to a chronic phase with cardiac alterations, and the follow-up by modern diagnostic methods is very difficult due to the socio-geographical characteristics of the Brazilian Amazon. Thus, alternatives should be sought to alleviate this problem. We conducted a study to evaluate subjects with ACD using the 12-lead ECG QRS score (Selvester score) as an estimative of myocardial injury progression before and after ACD treatment. Methods The study included indigenous subjects from the Amazon region with ACD in clinical follow-up at the Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) Chagas Disease outpatient clinic in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. The control group consisted of 31 healthy volunteers with no history of heart disease and no reactive serology for Chagas disease. Baseline ECG was performed in all subjects. The Selvester scoring method was performed according to the standardized guide (< 3 points: no myocardial injury,> 3: points x 3% = % of the predicted LV infarction). Results A total of 62 subjects were included, 31 as cases and 31 as controls. The mean follow-up of the case group was 17 months. The control group presented normal ECG. The case group presented 13 alterations before treatment and 11 after. Nineteen individuals presented scores > 3 points, 6 before and 13 after. In 19.36% of subjects, myocardial injury was found before treatment and in 41.94% after treatment. Conclusion This is the first study that uses the Selvester score (SS) to predict myocardial injury in subjects with ACD. The results of this study suggest the significant presence of myocardial injury from the beginning of treatment to the period post treatment of ACD, which demonstrates that the SS can be applied for stratification and follow-up of Chagas disease in the Amazon region."

The average annual age-sex standardized mortality rate was 0.211 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.170-0.252) deaths/100,000 inhabitants, with a significant upward trend (APC = 6.60%; 95% CI: 5.9-7.3). The highest Chagas disease-related death rates were in males (0.284 deaths/100,000 inhabitants), those >= 65 years old (1.296 deaths/100,000 inhabitants), and residents of the Orinoco region (1.809 deaths/100,000 inhabitants). There was a significant increase in mortality in the Orinoco (APC = 8.28%; 95% CI: 6.4-10.2), Caribbean (APC = 5.06%; 95% CI: 3.6-6.5), and Andean (APC = 4.63%; 95% CI: 3.9-5.3) regions. Conclusions: Chagas disease remains a major public health issue in Colombia with high mortality rates in older age groups, a wide geographic distribution, regional differences, and the potential to increase."

The objectives of this study were to estimate the infection rate and to characterize the trypanosome species infecting bats from three rural regions near the municipality of Cumaribo in Vichada, Colombia. Blood samples were collected from 39 bats. DNA was extracted from the blood samples and analyzed using nuclear genetic markers (SSU rDNA, ITS rDNA, and cathepsin genes) to discriminate among trypanosome species. Trypanosomes were detected in 66.7 % (26/39) of blood samples using PCR; 61.5 % (24/39) of infections were identified as Trypanosoma theileri and 5.1 % (2/39) as T. wauwau-like parasites. The phylogeographic analysis revealed that our T. theileri sequences were associated with the TthIIB genotype from cattle in Brazil and Venezuela. The T. wauwau-like parasites represent a new genotype of the species and were found in Molossus molossus and Platyrrhinus helleri bats. These data represent the first evidence of this trypanosome in both Colombia, and in these species of bats. Bat infections with T. theileri suggest an important role of these hosts in maintaining this genotype, probably acquired by ingesting insect vectors. The T. wauwau-like genotype in new mammalian host species supports the 'bat seeding' hypothesis of the T. cruzi clade. The epidemiological and evolutionary implications of these findings are discussed."

Triatomines were collected in peridomestic, sylvatic, and intradomicile habitats. House infestations were evaluated on five occasions, with spraying of infested houses.T.brasiliensiswas responsible for the high rates of dispersal, infestation, colonization andTrypanosoma cruziinfection in all catches and environments studied here. Spraying strongly reduced the infestation, but the number of triatomines rapidly returned to previous levels. Peridomicile represents a complex set of overlapping infested sites forming a network of shelters that favor the establishment and proliferation of triatomine colonies. Molecular characterization ofT.cruziisolated from triatomines and identification of their food sources emphasize the overlap of habitats and interaction among triatomines, synanthropic reservoirs and humans, increasing the risk of parasite transmission. Therefore, it is clear the need for maintenance of vector control fully and systematically with the use of appropriate strategies where interventions should consider regional ecoepidemiologic differences and the influence of environmental, socioeconomic and cultural factors inT.cruzytransmission process into domicile environment. The northeastern semiarid region stands out in the Brazilian context regarding the eco-epidemiology of Chagas disease, in whichTriatoma brasiliensisis the main vector ofTrypanosoma cruzi. Persistent house invasion threatens the relative levels of progress achieved over previous decades. We conducted an intervention trial with a five-year follow-up to assess the impacts of residual spraying with pyrethroid insecticides on house infestation withT.brasiliensisin 18 rural villages (242 houses) located in the Taua, Ceara. House infestations were assessed by systematic manual searches for triatomines in every domestic and peridomestic habitat on five occasions. Triatomines were collected in peridomestic (57.5%), sylvatic (35.8%), and intradomiciliary (6.7%) habitats. The most important ecotopes ofT.brasiliensiswere containing roofing tiles, bricks or rocks (23.4% +/- 9.1). Residual insecticide spraying substantially reduced baseline house infestation rates from 27.9% to 5.9% by 6 months post first spraying (MPS). The decline was substantially greater in intradomiciles (11.2% to 0.8%) than in peridomiciles (16.7% to 5%). The mean relative density of triatomines recovered its preintervention values at 14 MPS in intradomiciles, and in the main peridomestic ecotopes. The house infestation levels recorded at 14 MPS persisted thereafter despite all reinfested houses were selectively sprayed on every occasion. Overall average bug infection rates withT.cruziin the five occasions were in intradomiciles (11.1%), peridomiciles (4.7%) and wild habitats (3.3%). In peridomicileT.cruziinfection rates decreased significantly at all stages after chemical intervention. In intradomicile, the only significant difference occurred at 20 MPS (7.7% to 30.8%). The vectorial capacity ofT.brasiliensis, combined with its invasive potential from sylvatic sources and the limited effectiveness of chemical control in the harshcaatingalandscape, pose serious obstacles to the definite elimination of domestic transmission risks. Systematic vector surveillance supported by community participation and locally adapted environmental management measures are needed to reduce the risks of establishment of domestic transmission withT.cruziin this region."

A Triatoma brasiliensis brasiliensis Study Using Geometric Morphometrics in the Long Run","ANIMALS","12",NA,NA,"10.3390/ani12111362","Simple Summary Triatomines are vector insects capable of transmitting the protozoan that causes Chagas disease, thus representing a health risk in several countries, especially in Central and South America. Triatoma brasiliensis brasiliensis, the main triatomine vector in northeastern Brazil, needs frequent monitoring as it is able to colonize various natural and artificial ecotopes as well as to infest domiciles. This research uses geometric morphometrics as a tool to evaluate changes in the morphology and analyze a large temporal dataset of 102 years of collections of T. b. brasiliensis. Finding novelty results which indicate a morphological stasis in the morphology. Triatoma brasiliensis brasiliensis Neiva, 1911 is one of the most important vectors of Chagas disease in the Brazilian semiarid regions in the north-east. The risk imposed by T. b. brasiliensis to the human populations, due to frequent invasions and/or colonization of the domiciles, demands constant monitoring and control actions as well as an understanding of its evolutionary process. In this context, the following research studies the pattern of shape adaptation over time using a large dataset from 102 years of specimen collections in order to identify the morphological plasticity of this vector in Brazil. This dataset was analyzed using geometric morphometrics tools and the timescale was divided into eight different groups, containing specimens from 1912 to 2014. Geometric morphometrics analysis showed an interesting morphological stasis in the wing shape of T. b. brasiliensis, which allowed us to understand the high capacity of adaptation to changes in climate condition through time, and the invasive status which Triatoma species have around the world. Moreover, these results showed novel findings as an interesting phenotypic pattern, with no modifications in more than 100 years, leading us to understand the shape evolution in Triatominae as a vector species of diseases."

Historical colonization and determination of its genetic diversity and population structure may provide new information towards the improvement of vector control in the region. In this paper we present thoughtful analyses considering the phylogeography and demographic history of R. nasutus in the Caatinga. Methodology/Principal findings A total of 157 R. nasutus specimens were collected from Copernicia prunifera palm trees in eight geographic localities within the Brazilian Caatinga biome, sequenced for 595-bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cyt b) and genotyped for eight microsatellite loci. Sixteen hap lotypes were detected in the cyt b sequences, two of which were shared between different localities. Molecular diversity indices exhibited low diversity and a haplotype network revealed low divergence among R. nasutus sequences, with two central haplotypes shared by five of the eight populations analyzed. The demographic model that better represented R. nasutus population dynamics was the exponential growth model. Results of the microsatellite data analyses indicated that the entire population is comprised of four highly differentiated groups, with no obvious contemporary geographic barriers that could explain the population substructure detected. A complex pattern of migration was observed, in which a western Caatinga population seems to be the source of emigrants to the eastern populations. Conclusions/Significance R. nasutus that inhabit C. prunifera palms do not comprise a species complex. The species went through a population expansion at 12-10 ka, during the Holocene, which coincides with end of the largest dry season in South America. It colonized the Caatinga in a process that occurred from west to east in the region. R. nasutus is presently facing an important ecological impact caused by the continuous deforestation of C. prunifera palms in northeast Brazil. We hypothesize that this ecological disturbance might contribute to an increase in the events of invasion and colonization of human habitations."

This study has investigated the magnitude and mortality time trends for these diseases in the state of Sergipe, Northeast Region of Brazil. Methods: We conducted an ecological study of time series, based on secondary data derived from the Mortality Information System of the Ministry of Health. The mortality rates (crude, age-standardized rates and proportional ratio) were calculated from the deaths due to Neglected Tropical Diseases in the state of Sergipe, from 1980 to 2013. The time trends were obtained using the Joinpoint regression model. Results: Three hundred six thousand and eight hundred seventy-two deaths were certified in the state and Neglected Tropical Diseases were mentioned as the underlying cause in 1,203 certificates (0.39%). Mean number of deaths was 35.38 per year, and crude and age-standardized mortality rates were, respectively: 2.16 per 100 000 inhabitants (95% CI: 1.45-2.87) and 2.87 per 100 000 inhabitants (95% CI: 1.93-3.82); the proportional mortality ratio was 0.41% (95% CI: 0.27-0.54). In that period, Schistosomiasis caused 654 deaths (54.36%), followed by Chagas disease, with 211 (17.54%), and by Leishmaniases, with 142 (11.80%) deaths. The other diseases totalized 196 deaths (16.30%). There were increasing mortality trends for Neglected Tropical Diseases, Schistosomiasis and Chagas disease in the last 15 years, according to the age-standardized rates, and stability of the mortality trends for Leishmaniases. Conclusions: The Neglected Tropical Diseases show increasing trends and are a real public health problem in the state of Sergipe, since they are responsible for significant mortality rates. The following diseases call attention for showing greater number of deaths in the period of study: Schistosomiasis, Chagas disease and Leishmaniases.

One of them is the technique of molecular hybridisation: forming a hybrid compound from two or more pharmacophoric subunits. These hybrids may maintain the characteristics of the original compound and preferably show improvements to its pharmacological action, with reduced side effects and lower toxicity when compared to the original components. This study specifically focuses on synthesising hybrid molecules which demonstrate trypanocidal activity against the epimastigote and trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Methods: In this context, this study centres on the synthesis of a novel structural scaffold via molecular hybridisation; by using a triazole species to link a metronidazole unit to a eugenol analogue unit, the objective being to combine their therapeutic properties into a new molecular structure. The resulting hybrid molecules were evaluated against T cruzi which is responsible for high incidences of trypanosomiasis in tropical countries such as Brazil. Results: The results of this study showed an improvement in the anti-parasitic activity of the hybrid compounds with the best result coming from hybrid compounds [8] and [9], which present an activity similar to the control drug benznidazole. The new compounds, utilising a triazole species as a coupling connector, demonstrated promising results and has highlighted the path for planning similar structural patterns to investigate new compounds. Conclusions: In summary, we can conclude that the synthesised hybrid compounds demonstrate that using a triazole to link metronidazole with natural phenols, produces hybrid molecules that are promising as a new class of compounds of therapeutic interest for further investigation."

ForT. infestans, the shortest LT(50)was 6.3 (E9) and 7.3 days (157p). ForT. sordida, the shortest LT(50)was 8.0 days (157p). The lethal concentration sufficient to kill 50% ofT. infestans(LC50) was 1.9 x 10(7)conidia/ml for strain 157p. In three chicken coops that were sprayed withM. anisopliae, nymphs especially were well controlled, with a great population reduction of 38.5% after 17 days.

Information about clinical CD presentation, presence of comorbidities, functional class, previous benznidazole treatment, socioeconomic profile and lifestyle was also obtained. Environment and physical domains presented the worst QoL scores, while the social relationship domain presented the highest score. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that variables independently associated with QoL were functional class, sex, clinical presentation of CD, sleep duration, schooling, physical activity level, smoking, income per capita and residents by domicile. Conclusions Objectifs The low socioeconomic status and the physical limitations imposed by the disease presented an important impact on the QoL reduction among CD patients, especially on environment and physical domains. Strategies to improve QoL among CD patients should be tailored and consider many different variables to maximise improvements not only of patients' physical but also of their mental health."

ELISA is generally the method of choice for diagnosing T. cruzi exposure in dogs, but its performance substantially depends on the antigenic matrix employed. In previous studies, our group has developed four chimeric antigens (IBMP-8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4) and evaluated their potential for diagnosing T. cruzi exposure in humans. For human sera, these chimeric antigens presented superior diagnostic performances as compared to commercial tests available in Brazil, Spain, and Argentina. Therefore, in this study we have evaluated the potential of these antigenic proteins for detection of anti-T. cruzi IgG antibodies in dog sera. Methodology/Principal findings The IBMP-ELISA assays were optimized by checkerboard titration. Subsequently, the diagnostic potential was validated through analysis of ROC curves and the performance of the tests was determined using double entry tables. Cross-reactivity was also evaluated for babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, dirofilariosis, anaplasmosis, and visceral leishmaniosis. Best performance was shown by IBMP-8.3 and IBMP-8.4, although all four antigens demonstrated a high diagnostic performance with 46 positive and 149 negative samples tested. IBMP-8.3 demonstrated 100% sensitivity, followed by IBMP-8.4 (96.7-100%), IBMP-8.2 (73.3-87.5%), and IBMP-8.1 (50-100%). The highest specificities were achieved with IBMP-8.2 (100%) and IBMP-8.4 (100%), followed by IBMP-8.3 (96.7-97.5%) and IBMP 8.1 (89.1-100%). Conclusions/Significance The use of chimeric antigenic matrices in immunoassays for anti-T. cruzi IgG antibody detection in sera of infected dogs was shown to be a promising tool for veterinary diagnosis and epidemiological studies. The chimeric antigens used in this work allowed also to overcome the common hurdles related to serodiagnosis of T. cruzi infection, especially regarding variation of efficiency parameters according to different strains and cross-reactivity with other infectious diseases. Author summary Despite dogs being considered T. cruzi's most important domestic sentinel/reservoir and also suffering from the outcomes of the infection, there has never been a commercially available test to diagnose T. cruzi infection in dogs. As such, our group's objective was to develop a state-of-the-art serological diagnostic test utilizing four chimeric antigens (IBMP-8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4) in an ELISA platform to accurately identify canine anti-T. cruzi IgG antibodies. The IBMP-ELISA assays were optimized, evaluated for cross-reactivity towards multiple canine parasite's, including Leishmania spp., its diagnostic potential was validated and the test's performance was determined using double entry tables. The IBMP-8.3 antigen demonstrated 100% sensitivity, followed by IBMP-8.4, whereas the highest specificities were achieved with IBMP-8.2 (100%) and IBMP-8.4 (100%). Therefore, we've concluded that the serodiagnosis through anti-T. cruzi IgG detection in dogs, utilizing chimeric antigenic matrices in immunoassays is a promising tool for veterinary diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance. Furthermore, the use of chimeric antigens efficiently addressed common hurdles related to T. cruzi serodiagnosis, especially regarding efficiency variation in response to different strains and cross-reactivity."

Proximity between these animals and urban areas increases the need to know which pathogens these are and whether they can infect domestic animals and humans. In Mangabeiras Municipal Park in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, coatis live near the urban area, which is mainly occupied by human residents and their domestic animals. Therefore, the objective of this study was to detect, through molecular and direct methods, the presence of ectoparasites and hemoparasites in coatis. A total of 216 samples were collected, of which 209 samples were from first-captures and seven were from recaptures. The following parasites were found: ticks of the genus Amblyomma, lice of the species Neotrichodectes pallidus and fleas of the species Rhopalopsyllus Iutzi Iutzi and Ctenocephalides felis felis. All the samples were negative for the family Anaplasmataceae and the species Leishmania sp. and Trypanosoma cruzi. The hemoparasites Trypanosoma evansi, Hepatozoon procyonis, Babesia sp. and Sarcocystis neuron were found. The area of the present study is not endemic for T. evansi, which therefore suggests that these coatis may be acting as reservoirs or sentinels of this parasite. This finding is of great epidemiological importance and should be investigated more closely. Thus, this study showed that there is a great variety of pathogens in the park that transit among coatis and, probably, among other animals that inhabit or live close to the park."

Methods This retrospective review obtained data on disease burden from the Global Burden of Disease Study and funding data from open access sources. Publications were retrieved from Scopus and SciELO, and characterised according to the type of research conducted. Correlation between funding, research output and burden was assessed by comparing the 'expected' and 'observed' values for funding and publications relative to the proportional burden for each disease. Results There was an emphasis in basic biomedical research (average 30% of publications) and a shortage of health policy and systems (average 7%) and social sciences research (average 3%). Research output and funding were poorly correlated with disease burden. Tuberculosis, Chagas disease and schistosomiasis accounted for more than 75% of total NTD-related DALYs, but accounted for only 34% of publications. Leprosy, leishmaniasis and malaria, together, received 49% of NTD-related funding despite being responsible for only 9% of DALYs. Conclusions The analysis evidenced a lack of correlation between disease burden, research output and government funding for priority NTDs in Brazil. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring health needs, research investments and outputs to inform policy and optimise the uptake of evidence for action, particularly in developing countries, where resources are scarce and the research capacity is limited. The results contribute to health policy by highlighting the need for improving coordination of scientific activities and public health needs for effective impact."

We developed a score to predict 2-year mortality in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy from remote endemic areas. Methods and Results This study enrolled 1551 patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy from Minas Gerais State, Brazil, from the SaMi-Trop cohort (The Sao Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical Medicine Research Center). Clinical evaluation, ECG, and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) were performed. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to develop a prediction model based on the key predictors. The end point was all-cause mortality. The patients were classified into 3 risk categories at baseline (low, <2%; intermediate, >= 2% to 10%; high, >= 10%). External validation was performed by applying the score to an independent population with Chagas disease. After 2 years of follow-up, 110 patients died, with an overall mortality rate of 3.505 deaths per 100 person-years. Based on the nomogram, the independent predictors of mortality were assigned points: age (10 points per decade), New York Heart Association functional class higher than I (15 points), heart rate >= 80 beats/min (20 points), QRS duration >= 150 ms (15 points), and abnormal NT-proBNP adjusted by age (55 points). The observed mortality rates in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups were 0%, 3.6%, and 32.7%, respectively, in the derivation cohort and 3.2%, 8.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in the validation cohort. The discrimination of the score was good in the development cohort (C statistic: 0.82), and validation cohort (C statistic: 0.71). Conclusions In a large population of patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy, a combination of risk factors accurately predicted early mortality. This helpful simple score could be used in remote areas with limited technological resources."

This finding enabled us to describe it as Trypanosoma herthameyeri n. sp., which also infects other Leptodacylus species from the Pantanal and Caatinga biomes. Trypanosoma herthameyeri multiplies as small rounded forms clumped together and evolving into multiple-fission forms and rosettes of epimastigotes released as long forms with long flagella; scarce trypomastigotes and glove-like forms are common in stationary-phase cultures. For the first time, a trypanosome from an amphibian was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy, revealing a cytostome opening, well-developed flagellar lamella, and many grooves in pumpkin-like forms. Transmission electron microscopy showed highly developed Golgi complexes, relaxed catenation of KDNA, and a rich set of spongiome tubules in a regular parallel arrangement to the flagellar pocket as confirmed by electron tomography.

All patients underwent an evaluation protocol that included sociodemographic profile; epidemiological history; anamnesis; and physical, cardiologic, and digestive examinations. Trend differences for each 5-year period from 1986 to 2019 were tested using a nonparametric trend test for continuous and generalized linear models with binomial distribution for categorical variables. Results: A total of 2,168 patients (52.2% women) were included, with a mean age of 47.8 years old. White patients with low levels of education predominated. The reported transmission mode was vectorial in 90.2% of cases. The majority came from areas with a high prevalence (52.2%) and morbidity (67.8%) of CD. The most common clinical presentation was the indeterminate form (44.9%).

However, in mice chronically infected with T. cruzi, gestation induced a significant decrease in the frequency of T cells that expressed or co-expressed inhibitory receptors, as well as an increase in the frequency of polyfunctional CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. This different behavior may be due to the breakdown in the infected mice of the gestation-induced immune homeostasis, probably to control the parasite load. Remarkably, it was observed that the mothers that transmitted the parasite had a higher frequency of T cells that expressed and co-expressed inhibitory receptors as well as a lower frequency of polyfunctional parasite-specific T cells than those that did not transmit it, even though the parasitemia load was similar in both groups. All together these data suggest that the maternal immune profile of the CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells could be a determining factor in the congenital transmission of T. cruzi."

Methods We extracted information on cause of death, age, sex, ethnicity and place of residence from the nationwide mortality information system at the Brazilian Ministry of Health. We selected deaths in which the underlying cause of death was a neglected tropical disease (NTD), as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and based on its International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes. For specific NTDs, we estimated crude and age-adjusted mortality rates and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We calculated crude and age-adjusted mortality rates and mortality rate ratios by age, sex, ethnicity and geographic area. Findings Over the 12-year study period, 12 491 280 deaths were recorded; 76 847 deaths (0.62%) were caused by NTDs. Chagas disease was the most common cause of death (58 928 deaths; 76.7%), followed by schistosomiasis (6319 deaths; 8.2%) and leishmaniasis (3466 deaths; 4.5%). The average annual age-adjusted mortality from all NTDs combined was 4.30 deaths per 100 000 population (95% CI: 4.21-4.40). Rates were higher in males: 4.98 deaths per 100000; people older than 69 years: 33.12 deaths per 100000; Afro-Brazilians: 5.25 deaths per 100000; and residents in the central-west region: 14.71 deaths per 100000. Conclusion NTDs are important causes of death and are a significant public health problem in Brazil.There is a need for intensive integrated control measures in areas of high morbidity and mortality."

Thus, this purpose of this study was to characterize the deltamethrin susceptibility profile of peridomestic T. sordida populations from North of Minas Gerais - Brazil. Methods: Susceptibility to deltamethrin was assessed in seventeen peridomestic populations of T. sordida from North region of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Serial dilutions of deltamethrin in acetone (0.2 mu L) were topically applied in first instar nymphs (F1, five days old, fasting, weight 1.2 +/- 0.2 mg). Dose response results were analyzed with POLO program, determining the lethal doses, slope and resistance ratios (RR). Results: Susceptibility profile characterization of T. sordida populations revealed resistance ratios (RR50) ranging from 2.50 to 7.08. Conclusions: In fact, we know very little about the real impact of the resistance ratios obtained in the laboratory bioassays on the effectiveness of the vector control activities in the field. Thus, we prefer to refer to the populations with RR > 5 as populations with altered susceptibility.

To develop a reliable reference transcriptome for Triatoma brasiliensis, the major Chagas disease vector in Northeastern Brazil, different de novo assembly protocols were generated using various datasets and software. Both 454 and Illumina sequencing technologies were applied on RNA extracted from antennae and mouthparts from single or pooled individuals. The 454 library yielded 278 Mb. Fifteen Illumina libraries were constructed and yielded nearly 360 million RNA-seq single reads and 46 million RNA-seq paired-end reads for nearly 45 Gb.

Ten assembly workflows were compared using these programs separately or in combination. To compare the assemblies obtained, quantitative and qualitative criteria were used, including contig length, N50, contig number and the percentage of chimeric contigs. Completeness of the assemblies was estimated using the CEGMA pipeline.

There are no studies in the literature describing the extent of BZN use at this stage or the profile of patients using this drug. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with previous BZN use among individuals with CCC. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,812 individuals with CCC from 21 Brazilian cities endemic for CD. The dependent variable was ""prior use of BZN"" (no vs. yes). The independent variables were grouped into socioeconomic, lifestyle and medical history aspects. Binary logistic regression (alpha >= 0.05) was used. Among the evaluated individuals, 27.2% reported previous use of BZN. The likelihood of prior use of BZN was higher among younger individuals (OR = 2.7), individuals with a higher education (OR = 2.7), individuals with a lower monthly per capita income (OR = 1.3), individuals who practiced physical exercise (OR = 1.5), individuals who had prior knowledge of the CD diagnosis (OR = 2.5), individuals without hypertension (OR = 1.3) and individuals with a longer time to the CD diagnosis (OR = 6.1). The present study revealed a small proportion of therapeutic BZN use among Brazilian CCC patients. This finding suggests a late diagnosis and undertreatment of the disease. BZN use was higher among individuals with better clinical and demographic conditions but with a lower income and a longer time to the CD diagnosis.

CD has two distinct phases: acute and chronic. The generally asymptomatic acute phase begins shortly after infection and can last up to four months. When symptoms do appear, they are typically mild and unspecific. Following this phase, infected individuals evolve to a long-lasting chronic phase, which can be either symptomatic or asymptomatic. In Brazil, only acute cases are mandatorily notifiable in the Brazilian Notifiable Diseases Information System (Brazilian Ministry of Health). Most chronic cases are unknown and untreated. Considering that epidemiological data related to ACD is publicly available, we have analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of notified cases of ACD and evaluated relevant epidemiological indicators throughout Brazil from 2001 to 2018. The data present here may contribute to surveillance actions designed at preventing new CD cases. We observed 5,184 cases of ACD during the period under study. The annual incidence rate in Brazil was 0.16 per 100,000 inhabitants/year. Three distinct epidemiological periods were identified: a rapid increase prior to 2005 (Period 1), a stable drop from 2005 to 2009 (Period 2), followed by another increasing trend after 2009 (Period 3). Vectorial transmission was the main route reported during Period 1, while oral transmission was found to increase significantly in the North during the other periods. Despite regional differences, over time cases of ACD decreased significantly nationwide. An increasing trend was noted in the North (especially after 2007). In light of the newly identified epidemiological profile of CD transmission in Brazil, we emphasize the need for strategically integrated entomological and health surveillance actions. Background In Brazil, acute Chagas disease (ACD) surveillance involves mandatory notification, which allows for population-based epidemiological studies. We conducted a nationwide population-based ecological analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns of ACD notifications in Brazil using secondary surveillance data obtained from the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) maintained by Brazilian Ministry of Health. Methodology/Principal findings In this nationwide population-based ecological all cases of ACD reported in Brazil between 2001 and 2018 were included. Epidemiological characteristics and time trends were analyzed through joinpoint regression models and spatial distribution using microregions as the unit of analysis. A total of 5,184 cases of ACD were recorded during the period under study. The annual incidence rate in Brazil was 0.16 per 100,000 inhabitants/year. Three statistically significant changes in time trends were identified: a rapid increase prior to 2005 (Period 1), a stable drop from 2005 to 2009 (Period 2), followed by another increasing trend after 2009 (Period 3). Higher frequencies were noted in males and females in the North (all three periods) and in females in Northeast (Periods 1 and 2) macroregions, as well as in individuals aged between 20-64 years in the Northeast, and children, adolescents and the elderly in the North macroregion. Vectorial transmission was the main route reported during Period 1, while oral transmission was found to increase significantly in the North during the other periods. Spatiotemporal distribution was heterogeneous in Brazil over time. Despite regional differences, over time cases of ACD decreased significantly nationwide.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a POEM in the management of achalasia with and without Chagas disease in patients receiving POEM.Methods:Patients who underwent POEM from tertiary centers in Latin America were included in a dedicated registry. Countries included Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. Patients enrolled needed to have a preoperative manometry and swallow contrast study confirming achalasia. Clinical success was defined as significant improvement in Eckardt score after therapy.Results:POEM was technically successful in 81/89 (91%) patients (mean age, 44 y). There was a significant decrease in preprocedure and postprocedure Eckardt score from 8.7 (range, 3 to 12) to 2.15 (0 to 10) (P<0.001), preprocedure and postprocedure barium swallow evaluation (98% vs. 89%; P=0.017), and preprocedure and postprocedure lower esophageal sphincter pressure measurement (from 35 to 13.8 mm Hg; P<0.001). Clinical success was achieved in 93% of patients. Patients with Chagas disease (n=58) were 9.5 times more likely to respond to POEM (P=0.0020; odds ratio, 9.5).Conclusions:POEM is an efficacious and safe therapeutic modality for treatment of achalasia in Latin America. Chagas disease-related achalasia seems to particularly respond better to POEM when it is performed by experienced endoscopists. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

This plant species contains high concentrations of neolignan and dehydrodieugenol derivatives that express significant in-vitro activities against various parasite strains. These activities are however responsible for severe tropical human infections, such as Leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.) and Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), which have been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). In order to optimize the isolation process for these target metabolites, n-hexane extract of the leaves was separated by means of semi-preparative high performance countercurrent chromatography (HPCCC) and scale-up spiral-coil countercurrent chromatography (sp-CCC) systems. Several biphasic solvent mixtures were evaluated for their partitioning effects on neolignans, resulting in the selection of an optimized system n-hexane - ethylacetate - methanol - water (7:3:7:3, v/v/v/v). The chromatographic experiments on the HPCCC and sp-CCC were run in the head-to-tail mode with 500 mg and 16 g injections, respectively. For specific and multiple metabolite detection, the recovered CCC-fractions were off-line injected, in the sequence of recovery, to an electrospray mass-spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) device. A projection of the single ion traces of the target compounds, in the positive ionization mode at a scan range of m/z 100-1500, located chromatographic areas where the co-elution effects occurred and pure target metabolites were present. Five major target neolignans were specifically detected, which enabled the accurate pooling of CCC-fractions for an optimum recovery of the metabolites. The direct comparison of the performance characteristics of the two CCC-devices, with very different mechanical designs was achieved by the conversion of the time axis into a partition ratio (K-D) separation scale. As a result, the compound specific K-D-elution values of the target neolignan were determined in high precision, while the comparison of the calculated separation factor (alpha) and resolution factor (R-s) values revealed a superior separation performance for the HPCCC system. Also, the reproducibility of detected metabolites in the two CCC experiments was confirmed by small variations (Delta K-D +/- 0.1). Neolignan target compounds with anti-parasite activities were successfully isolated in the 100 mg to 4 g range in a single lab-scale countercurrent chromatographic process step.

Presently, the aim of this paper was to investigate a possible endocrine and immunologic alteration observed during a successful pregnancy. This study consistently showed that plasma corticosterone levels were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in pregnant Wistar rats than in virgin female. An increased number of peritoneal macrophages was also detected in pregnant females when compared to non-pregnant ones. Macrophages play an important role in the production of bioactive proteins and lipids such as nitric oxide. Then, in support of the latter, the present study showed increased levels of endogenous NO in pregnant rats when compared to non-pregnant ones, thereby mediating the vasodilatation process of normal gestation. Furthermore, our FACS analysis clearly indicated the correlation between reduced CD161 expression on NK cells (P < 0.0001) in pregnant rats when compared to virgin females. It was found that pregnancy appears to be associated with depressed cell immunity, as evidenced by a significant inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation. Understanding the immunological paradox of maternal tolerance, as well as the hormonal modulation of the immune environment during pregnancy is essential for future studies to investigate the potential for these processes to be modulated by diet or effective therapeutics during pregnancy.

Data on post-heart transplant (HT) survival of patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC) are scarce. We sought to evaluate post-HT survival in patients with CC as compared with other causes of heart failure across different eras of HT. Methods. We conducted a retrospective, cohort study of 376 adult HT recipients between October 1997 and November 2019. Participants were classified according to the etiology of heart failure as CC (N =66), nonischemic cardiomyopathy (N =214), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (N =96), and according to the era of HT as early (1997-2009), recent (2010-2014), and current era (2015-2019). Results. After a mean follow-up of 5.0 y (0-20.5 y), post-HT survival rates at 1, 5, and 10 y were comparable between groups. One-y survival improved from 70% in the early eras to 80% in the current era (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.97; P=0.034). After adjustment for sex, age, and mechanical circulatory support, time-related improvement in survival was observed only in patients without CC (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91; P=0.019) but not in those with CC (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.36-2.73; P=0.98). Causes of death were similar between patients with CC and the other etiological subgroups. Conclusions. Posttransplant survival is comparable between patients with CC, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Although survival has improved significantly over years for most HT recipients, it has remained unchanged for those with Chagas disease. These trends underscore the importance of scientific research, policy discussions and a collaborative registry of heart transplantation in Chagas cardiomyopathy."

Besides the social and economic burden of these migrants, Brazil must manage the health-related issues arising as consequence of these Venezuelan migrants. Poor health services in Venezuela along with unhygienic travelling conditions, lack of food (malnutrition) and potable water, unhealthy and overcrowded refugee camps or shelters, poor availability of medical services have made the migrant Venezuelan population susceptible to various diseases, especially infectious diseases. SINAN system is a health-related system in Brazil that keeps track of different health occurrences in the society and allows health care workers and policymakers free access to these data. Objectives: To evaluate the emergence of infectious diseases as a consequence of the arrival of Venezuelans immigrants in Brazil and to assess the importance of SINAN for epidemiological surveillance. Methods: Observational retrospective study. Data were collected from the SINAN system between 2015 and 2017 and was analyzed using descriptive statistics, and Mann-Whitney test (using SPSS tool version 12). Evaluated infectious diseases in this study were tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV/AIDS, syphilis, viral hepatitis, leishmaniasis, and malaria.

Although the species is considered predominantly peridomestic, it is also capable of colonizing households and forming numerous intra-household colonies, leading to its inclusion among the priorities for triatomine control campaigns in Brazil. All Brazilian populations of T. sordida are considered as T. sordida sensu stricto by chromosomal analyses (which highlights their epide-miological importance), although molecular studies that characterize the genetic diversity of these populations are scarce, being restricted only to the region of Minas Gerais. Thus, several populations of this vector distributed in the states of Bahia, Goias, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Minas Gerais were analyzed using mitochondrial markers (cyt b and nd1). Low nucleotide diversity, high haplotypic diversity, low genetic distance, and high FST value were observed, as well as the formation of a monophyletic clade of the Brazilian populations of T. sordida, which confirms that this species has low genetic variability, with all specimens in Brazil grouped in T. sordida sensu stricto.

In a logistic regression model using peak VO(2)as the dependent variable, haemoglobin (odds ratio, 1.506; 95% confidence interval, 1.043-2.177;P = 0.029) and ALM (odds ratio, 1.179; 95% confidence interval, 1.011-1.374;P = 0.035) were independent predictors for peak VO(2)adjusted by age, left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association, creatinine, and FBF. Conclusions Patients with Chagas disease and HF have decreased fat mass and exhibit reduced peripheral blood flow and impaired muscle strength compared with ischaemic HF patients. In addition, patients with Chagas disease and HF show a tendency to have greater reduction in total LBM, with ALM remaining an independent predictor of reduced functional capacity in these patients. The percentage of patients affected by sarcopenia was equal between groups."

CD clinical forms (indeterminate, digestive, cardiac and cardiodigestive) and the stages of the cardiac form were classified according to the II Brazilian Consensus on CD. Statistical analyses were based on univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results Older age and Brazilian birth state (Minas Gerais and Bahia) were associated with a greater likelihood of the cardiac form of CD. A greater likelihood of the digestive form was seen in men and those of older age. Patients with arterial hypertension and diabetes were less likely to have the digestive form. Men had a greater likelihood of having a more severe cardiac presentation. Those from Minas Gerais and Bahia states had a greater likelihood of having stage B1 or B2.

Blood banks need to establish a screening service capable of reducing associated transfusions risks. Objective: The objective of this study was to establish the prevalence of transfusion-transmissible infection markers in donors at a hemotherapy service located in southwest Bahia, Brazil. Methods: A retrospective study was performed between 2010 and 2016. Variables, such as the characterization of donors who were suitable and unsuitable for donation (in clinical screening), stratification by gender and age group and unsuitable samples for reactive test results (in serological screening) by aspecific antibodies against hepatitis B virus (anti-HBc and HBsAg), hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), human T-lymphotropic virus (anti-HTLV I/II), HIV virus (anti-HIV I/II), chagas disease, and syphilis markers, were evaluated. Results: Collected data showed that 3.13% of the donors were considered unsuitable for serological screening and that the prevalence of reactive test results was higher in donors aged between 30 and 39 years and in males. The means of the serological markers was 1.09% for syphilis reagents, 0.63% for anti-HIV I/II, 0.51% for anti-HBc and anti-HCV, 0.15% for HBsAg, 0.14% for HTLV I/II and 0.10% for Chagas disease.

The original cohort however did not include Chagas disease (ChD) patients. We aim to evaluate the relevance of the score in a ChD population. Methods The PAINESD risk score gives weighted values for specific characteristics (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, age > 60 years, ischemic cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class 3 or 4, ejection fraction less than 25%, VT storm, and diabetes). The score was applied in a retrospective cohort of ChD VT ablations in a single tertiary center in Brazil. Data were collected by VT study reports and patient record analysis at baseline and on follow-up. Results Between January 2013 and December 2018, 157 VT catheter ablation procedures in 121 ChD patients were analyzed. Overall, 30-day mortality was 9.0%. Multivariate analysis correlated NYHA functional class (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.03-3.08, P 0.038) and the need for urgent surgery (HR 31.5, 95% CI 5.38-184.98, P < 0.001), as well as a tendency for VT storm at presentation (HR 2.72, 95% CI 0.87-8.50, P 0.084) as risk factors for the primary endpoint. The median PAINESD risk score in this population was 3 (3-8). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.64 (95% CI 0.479-0.814). Conclusions The PAINESD risk score did not perform well in predicting 30-day mortality in ChD patients. Pre-procedure NYHA functional class and the need for urgent surgery due to refractory pericardial bleeding were independently associated with increased 30-day mortality. Prospective studies are needed to take final conclusions in Chagas disease when using PAINESD score."

The prevalence of markers for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and B (HBV), human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1/2), Chagas disease, and syphilis in an SCD cohort in Brazil were studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Clinical history, interview data, blood samples, and medical chart review data were collected during cohort enrollment from November 2013 to May 2015. Serologic markers of infection were assessed. Standard measures of statistical association were calculated, and multivariable models were developed for the most prevalent infections to identify associated factors. RESULTS Infection markers were evident in 5.2% (144/2779) of the enrolled cohort. Anti-HCV was detected in 69 (2.5%), syphilis antibodies in 34 (1.2%), anti-HTLV-1/2 in 17 (0.6%), HBV surface antigen in 13 (0.5%), Chagas disease antibodies in 13 (0.5%), and anti-HIV in 8 (0.3%) of participants. Factors associated with increased odds of being anti-HCV reactive were older age, illegal drug use, increasing number of RBCs, more than three pain crises in the previous year, and geographic location. Syphilis was associated with older age, females, and smoking history. CONCLUSION HCV infection was more common in older patients who may have received RBCs before testing was performed on donations, suggesting possible historic transfusion transmission. The cohort showed decreasing rates of infections and a reduction in transfusion transmission markers in younger patients compared to historical literature except for syphilis, indicating contemporary reduced risk of TTI."

Fusiform epimastigotes from the hematophagous isolates were elongated, whereas those of the insectivorous isolate were stumpy, reflected in statistically evident differences in the cell body and flagellum lengths. In the hemocultures, a higher percentage of trypomastigote forms (60%) was observed in the hematophagous bat isolates than that in the isolate from the insectivorous bat (4%), which demonstrated globular morphology. Three molecular DNA regions were analyzed: V7V8 (18S rDNA), glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, and mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The samples were also subjected to multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. All isolates were identified as T. dionisii by phylogenetic analysis. These sequences were clustered into two separate subgroups with high bootstrap values according to the feeding habits of the bats from which the parasites were isolated. However, other T. dionisii samples from bats with different feeding habits were found in the same branch.

Time trends related to health behaviors show a substantial reduction in smoking rates, but a rising prevalence of overweight and obesity, unhealthy eating habits, and insufficient physical activity. The high prevalence of hypertension and the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus are also causes for concern. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the leading cause of mortality since the 1960s and has accounted for a substantial percentage of all hospitalizations.

YLDs were calculated by multiplying the prevalence of sequelae multiplied by its disability weight. YLLs were estimated by multiplying each death by the reference life expectancy at each age. DALYs were computed as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. Principal findings In 2016, there were 475,410 DALYs (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 337,334-679,482; age-standardized rate of 232.0 DALYs/100,000 population) from the 12 selected NTDs, accounting for 0.8% of national all-cause DALYs. Chagas disease was the leading cause of DALYs among all NTDs, followed by schistosomiasis and dengue. The sex-age-specific NTD burden was higher among males and in the youngest and eldest (children <1 year and those aged >= 70 years). The highest age-standardized DALY rates due to all NTDs combined at the state level were observed in Goias (614.4 DALYs/100,000), Minas Gerais (433.7 DALYs/100,000), and Distrito Federal (430.0 DALYs/100,000). Between 1990 and 2016, the national age-standardized DALY rates from all NTDs decreased by 45.7%, with different patterns among NTD causes and Brazilian states. Most NTDs decreased in the period, with more pronounced reduction in DALY rates for onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, and rabies. By contrast, age-standardized DALY rates due to dengue, visceral leishmaniasis, and trichuriasis increased substantially. Age-standardized DALY rates decreased for most Brazilian states, increasing only in the states of Amapa A, Ceara A, Rio Grande do Norte, and Sergipe. Conclusions/Significance GBD 2016 findings show that, despite the reduction in disease burden, NTDs are still important and preventable causes of disability and premature death in Brazil. The data call for renewed and comprehensive efforts to control and prevent the NTD burden in Brazil through evidence-informed and efficient and affordable interventions. Multi-sectoral and integrated control and surveillance measures should be prioritized, considering the population groups and geographic areas with the greatest morbidity, disability, and most premature deaths due to NTDs in the country."

Many cytogenetic, morphometric, and molecular markers have been applied to address this. Recent studies have posed concerns on the inclusion of T. guasayana and T. patagonica within the subcomplex. Also, T. sordida from Argentina has been designed as a new species, Triatoma rosai. Using the cuticular hydrocarbon pattern as chemotaxonomic marker, the relationships among several populations of these species were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography and linear discriminant analysis along 25 collection sites in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay.

It is suspected that with prolonged usage of these drugs, resistant parasites will be selected, which results in risk for treatment failure over the time. Herein, we studied the in vitro activity of artesunate, the most effective drug to treat severe P. falciparum and chloroquine-resistant P. vivax, on three strains of T. cruzi originated in different regions of Latin America (Argentina, Nicaragua and Brazil). The results of these assays showed that artesunate inhibits multiplication of epimastigotes (IC50 = 50, 6.10 and 23 mu M, respectively) and intracellular amastigotes (IC50 = 15, 0.12 and 6.90 mu M, respectively), indicating that it represents a potent anti-T. cruzi compound in terms of inhibiting parasite multiplication in vitro. We then tested the effect of artesunate in Balb/c mice infected with Brazil strain and found that it failed to cure the infection, suggesting that the drug may be unsuitable for in vivo treatment. When infected mice were treated with high doses AS + BZ, the outcome of infection was similar to that observed in mice treated with BZ alone. Nevertheless, understanding of structure-activity relationship of artesunate might lead to the development of new and effective drugs against T. cruzi. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Aging and obesity are important matters in patients with CD, as is hypovitaminosis D3, which can decrease the quality of life of these patients. Immunomodulation mediated by vitamin D3, especially the production of antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin LL-37, might be related to the severity and symptoms of CD. This study aimed to determine the serum levels of vitamin D and LL37 and VDR gene polymorphisms in patients with chronic CD. Methods: This study included male patients with cardiac and indeterminate clinical forms of CD. Clinical, anthropometric, and blood parameters were obtained. Serum levels of 25(OH)D3 and LL-37 were determined by chemiluminescence and enzyme-linked immunosoibent assay respectively. Fok (rs731236), Bsm (rs1544410), Apa (rs7975232), and Taq (rs731236) polymorphisms of the VDR gene were investigated by PCR-RFLP. Results: Sixty-four patients were included in the study: 18 of the cardiac form and 46 of the indeterminate form. No differences in age, ethnicity, BMI, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemias were observed between groups. However, the serum levels of 25(OH)D3, but not of LL-37, were lower in the cardiac form group. The association among polymorphisms, vitamin D, and clinical form was not significant. Conclusions: Decreased levels of vitamin D suggest an association with the cardiac form of CD. Studies investigating the roles of vitamin D and LL-37 in the immune response and their associations with VDR polymorphisms and disease susceptibility are necessary."

Thus, the objective of the present study was to ascertain the seroprevalence of canine VL (CVL) and the associated factors in the Brejo Paraibano microregion, northeastern Brazil. A total of 409 dogs were sampled from the eight municipalities of the microregion: Alagoa Grande, Alagoa Nova, Areia, Bananeiras, Borborema, Matinhas, Piloes and Serraria. The diagnosis of CVL was made using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA S7 (R)), through which the prevalence observed was 29.3%. By robust Poisson regression analysis two factors were associated with seroprevalence: illiterate/incomplete elementary owner's education level (prevalence ratio = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.05-2.34; p-value = 0.027) and tick infestation (prevalence ratio = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.27-2.61; p-value = 0.001). It is concluded that the seroprevalence of CVL in the Brejo Paraibano microregion is high. The factors associated with seroprevalence indicated the importance to develop socioeducational actions on the population, and the finding that tick infestation was associated with seroprevalence shows that there is a need for investigation regarding the role of ticks in the epidemiology of CVL."

Aims: This study aimed to describe a multicenter cohort of patients with concomitant CD and IS admitted in tertiary centers and to create a predictive model for cardioembolic embolism in CD and IS. Materials and methods: We retrospectively studied data obtained from electronic medical and regular medical records of patients with CD and IS in several academic, hospital-based, and university hospitals across Brazil. Descriptive analyses of cardioembolic and non-cardioembolic patients were performed. A prediction model for cardioembolism was proposed with 70% of the sample as the derivation sample, and the model was validated in 30% of the sample. Results: A total of 499 patients were analyzed. The median age was similar in both groups; however, patients with cardioembolic embolism were younger and tended to have higher alcoholism, smoking, and death rates. The predictive model for the etiological classification showed close relation with the number of abnormalities detected on echocardiography and electrocardiography as well as with vascular risk factors. Conclusions: Our results replicate in part those previously published, with a higher prevalence of vascular risk factors and lower median age in patients with cardioembolic etiology.

We included all deaths that occurred in Brazil between 2000 and 2011, in which leprosy was mentioned in any field of death certificates. Results: Leprosy was identified in 7732/12 491 280 deaths (0.1%). Average annual age-adjusted mortality rate was 0.43 deaths/100 000 inhabitants (95% CI 0.40-0.46). The burden of leprosy deaths was higher among males, elderly, black race/colour and in leprosy-endemic regions. Lepromatous leprosy was the most common clinical form mentioned. Mortality rates showed a significant nationwide decrease over the period (annual percent change [APC]: -22.8%; 95% CI -4.2 to -2.4). We observed decreasing mortality rates in the South, Southeast and Central-West regions, while the rates remained stable in North and Northeast regions.

To present a method to identify critical areas for selected infectious and parasitic diseases for the purpose of health surveillance and to analyze the association between these critical areas and poverty indicators in Brazil. Method. The following incidence rates were mapped: dengue, acute Chagas disease, schistosomiasis, Hansen's disease, hepatitis A, cutaneous leishmaniasis, visceral leishmaniasis, leptospirosis, malaria, and tuberculosis. The analyses were performed for the period from 2010 to 2017 based on a synthetic indicator calculated as the mean of mean incidence coefficients for each disorder, normalized by the mean and standard deviation during the period of analysis. A 2014 population estimate was used. The calculated coefficients were stratified for classification of municipalities into very high, high, medium, low, or very low criticality according to each disorder. Indicators expressing several socioeconomic dimensions and space segregation in Brazilian municipalities were also selected and tested regarding their association with the transmission of the diseases under study. Results. The indicator showed that 40.5% of Brazilian municipalities had high criticality for the diseases of interest, especially in the North, parts of the Northeast, and Midwest. Indicators ""proportion of poverty,"" ""garbage in surroundings,"" and ""families headed by women"" increased the chance of higher criticality for the diseases. The indicator ""adequate sewer system"" was a potential protection factor. Conclusions.

Food-borne diseases, caused by pathogens, natural toxins, and chemical contaminants, remain a global public health challenge, since new threats are continuously emerging while others are being controlled. Also, in many countries, the consumption of food prepared outside the home increases the exposure to the risks posed by poor hygiene in food service. In this context, a reliable sanitary surveillance system is urgently needed to identify potential hazards, conduct risk analysis, and control food-borne diseases outbreaks worldwide.

Our objective is to assess the prevalence of AF and the associated medical conditions in Brazilian primary care patients. Methods and results This is an observational retrospective study. Patients >= 5 years of age from primary care centres of 658 municipalities in Minas Gerais, Brazil, who performed digital electrocardiograms (ECGs) by a public telehealth service in 2011 were assessed. Clinical data were self-reported, and ECGs were interpreted by a team of trained cardiologists using standardized criteria. To assess the relation between clinical characteristics and AF, odds ratios were estimated by logistic regression. A total of 262 685 primary care patients were included, mean (SD) age of 50.3 (19.3) years, 59.6% female. Hypertension was reported in 32.0%, family history of coronary heart disease in 15.0%, diabetes in 5.4%, hyperlipidaemia in 2.8%, Chagas disease in 2.9%, and 7.1% reported current smoking. The prevalence of AF was 1.8% overall: 2.4% in men (ranging from 0.001% from 5 19 years old to 14.6% in nonagenarians) and 1.3% in women (ranging from 0.001% from 5-19 years old to 8.7% in nonagenarians) (P<0.001). The prevalence of AF increased with advancing age. The comorbidities associated with AF were Chagas disease, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Vitamin K antagonist use was reported by 1.5% of patients. Conclusion The prevalence and age distribution of AF were similar to studies in high-income countries. The proportion of patients who reported the use of anticoagulants was alarmingly low. Our findings point out the necessity to formulate effective treatment strategies for AF in Brazilian primary care settings."

A standardized questionnaire was used to collect clinical-epidemiological, virological, and immunological data from the medical records of all HIV-infected patients (n=539) who were followed at the regional reference center of Jatai, Goias State, Brazil, from 2005 to 2015. We detected the prevalence of male patients and the heterosexual route of transmission, as well as an expressive number of young women infected with HIV. The HIV infection was more prevalent in reproductive ages (55.3%). Most patients presented clinical manifestations related to HIV infection at the time of diagnosis. Twenty-four patients presented coinfection with hepatitis C virus, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, leprosy or Chagas disease. Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii was the most common opportunistic infection, followed by neurotoxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and neurocryptococcosis. Combined antiretroviral therapy improved CD4+ T-cell counts: the mean CD4+ T-cell counts after treatment was twice as high as those found at the first medical appointment; and highly active antiretroviral therapy promoted viral suppression in a significant number of patients. Considering the increasing distribution of HIV infection to the interior of Brazil, this descriptive study outlines the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of HIV infection in Southwestern Goias and contributes to develop local prevention strategies and public service plans."

Method: In vitro tests against Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania sp. and citotoxicity were performed. The evaluation of the antibacterial and bacterial resistance modulatory effect was given by the microdilution method. Results: The chemical profile show different classes of compounds with significant presence of quercetrin and caffeic acid. The EHXA demonstrated activity only in the concentration of 1000 mu g/mL against the L. infantum and L. brasiliensis promastigotes, causing mortality percentage of 40.66 and 27.62%, respectively. The extract presented a significant toxicity only in the concentration of 1000 mu g/mL, causing a mortality of 55.42% of fibroblasts. The antibacterial activity of the EHXA demonstrated a MIC value >= 1024 mu g/mL against all the tested bacteria. However, in the modulation assay with EHXA in association with different antibiotics the extract had a synergistic effect against S. aureus strains when associated with norfloxacin.

Chlamydial infections can lead to severe clinical sequelae including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and tuba! infertility. As an obligate intracellular pathogen, Ct has evolved multiple strategies to promote adhesion and invasion of host cells, including those involving both bacterial and host glycans. Here, we show that galectin-1 (Gall), an endogenous lectin widely expressed in female and male genital tracts, promotes Ct infection. Through glycosylation-dependent mechanisms involving recognition of bacterial glycoproteins and N-glycosylated host cell receptors, Gall enhanced Ct attachment to cervical epithelial cells. Exposure to Gall, mainly in its dimeric form, facilitated bacterial entry and increased the number of infected cells by favoring Ct-Ct and Ct-host cell interactions. These effects were substantiated in vivo in mice lacking Gall or complex 01-6-branched Nglycans. Thus, disrupting Gall-N-glycan interactions may limit the severity of chlamydial infection by inhibiting bacterial invasion of host cells."

It may manifest in visceral and tegumentary forms, and pentavalent antimonials are the first choice drugs used for the treatment. Frequently these drugs show low efficiency and high toxicity to mammalian host. The present study describes the chemical profile and the in vitro leishmanicidal effects of red propolis and Dalbergia ecastaphyllum extracts from Sergipe, Brazil, in Leishmania chagasi and Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes. The phenolic composition of the extracts was evaluated by direct infusion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) fingerprinting. The leishmanicidal effect was evaluated by the Resazurin colorimetric method. Similar composition profiles have been found for D. ecastaphyllum and propolis samples. The isoflavones formononetin, biochanin A, daidzein and pinocembrin were identified in both extracts. Propolis extract showed leishmanicidal activity in both L. chagasi and L. amazonensis, with IC50 values of 21.54 and 9.73 mu g/mL, respectively. The D. ecastaphyllum extract presented activity only in L. amazonensis, with IC50 of 53.42 mu g/mL. These results suggest that red propolis extract from Sergipe has the leguminosae D. ecastaphyllum as botanical origin, and that it presents potential leishmanicidal activity, which may be associated with the presence of the phenolic compounds found in its composition."

Methods We selected a T. caninum isolate with a high percentage of aflagellar epimastigote forms in axenic cultures. Two separate growth curves were generated for T. caninum cultured in Schneider axenic medium and co-cultured with the DH82 cell line, followed by analysis and quantification of evolutionary forms using bright field microscopy. In addition, ultrastructural analysis of T. caninum was performed under both cultivation conditions. Results The growth curves of T. caninum under axenic and co-cultivation conditions exhibited similar profiles. However, in the axenic culture, the number of parasites was three times higher at the peak of the exponential phase than in the co-culture. In contrast to that in the axenic culture, in which only the epimastigote forms were observed along the entire curve, during co-cultivation with the DH82 cell line, differentiation was observed for the trypomastigote and spheromastigote forms in low proportions. These results demonstrated that when cultured alone, the T. caninum isolate preserved the aflagellar epimastigote form, but in the presence of DH82 canine macrophages, they differentiated into evolutionary forms, particularly trypomastigote forms. Moreover, this study is the first to describe the presence of lipid bodies, structure described as the parasite's nutritional reserve, throughout the body of T. caninum. Conclusions These findings describe biological and ultrastructural aspects of epimastigote aflagellar and suggest that this evolutionary form may be involved in the biological cycle of T. caninum, still unknown."

However, CD became globalized in recent decades. The majority of the chronically infected individuals did not receive etiologic treatment for several reasons, among them the most conspicuous is the lack of access to diagnosis. The impact of trypanocidal treatment on CD chronic phase, without cardiac involvement (indeterminate form ICF), is yet to be determined. We aimed to evaluate the effect of trypanocidal treatment with benznidazole (BZN) on the rate of progression to Chagas heart disease in patients with ICF. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort observational study including patients with ICF treated with BZN and compared to a group of non-treated patients matched for age, sex, region of origin, and the year of cohort entry. We reviewed the medical charts of all patients followed from May 1987 to June 2020 at the outpatient center of the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INI) of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Patients' follow-up included at least one annual medical visit and one annual electrocardiogram (ECG). Echocardiographic exams were performed at baseline and during the follow-up. Disease progression from ICF to cardiac form was defined by changes in baseline ECG. Cumulative incidence and the incidence rate were described in the incidence analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between BZN and CD progression, cardiovascular events or death. Findings: One hundred and fourteen treated patients met the study inclusion criteria. A comparison group of 114 non-treated patients matched for age, sex, region of origin, and the year of cohort entry was also included, totalizing 228 patients. Most patients included in the study were male (70.2%), and their mean age was 31.3 (+7.4) years. Over a median follow-up of 15.1 years (ranging from 1.0 to 32.4), the cumulative CD progression incidence in treated patients was 7.9% vs. 21.1% in the non-treated group (p = 0.04) and the CD progression rate was 0.49 per 1.000 patients/year in treated patients vs. 1.10 per 1.000 patients/year for non-treated patients (p = 0.02). BZN treatment was associated with a decreased risk of CD progression in both unadjusted (HR 0.46; 95%CI 0.21 to 0.98) and adjusted (HR 0.43; 95%CI 0.19 to 0.96) models and with a decreased risk of occurrence of the composite of cardiovascular events only in the adjusted (HR 0.15; 95%CI 0.03 to 0.80) model. No association was observed between BZN treatment and mortality. Interpretation: In a long-term follow-up, BZN treatment was associated with a decreased incidence of CD progression from ICF to the cardiac form and also with a decreased risk of cardiovascular events. Therefore, our results indicate that BZN treatment for CD patients with ICF should be implemented into clinical practice. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The nymphicidal and ovicidal activity of thymol, carvacrol, and EOLS was assessed by tests using impregnated Petri dishes. The lethal concentration values (LC50) for EOLS, carvacrol, and thymol were 54.48, 32.98, and 9.38 mg/cm(2), respectively. The ovicidal test showed that both carvacrol and thymol (50 mg/cm(2)) inhibited hatching (50% and 23.3%, respectively), while treatments with 10 mg/cm(2) or 50 mg/cm(2) EOLS did not affect the hatching rate at all (80% and 90%, respectively). We observed an anti-feeding effect in insects fed with blood containing natural products at the higher concentrations (100 mu g/mL). Finally, excretion rate was affected by EOLS and carvacrol, but not by thymol. These findings offer novel insights into basic physiological processes that make the tested natural compounds interesting candidates for new types of insecticides."

Observations were performed in the dorsal and the ventral views. The morphological characterization of female external genitalia allowed a differentiation of each species/subspecies. The subspecies T. b. brasiliensis and T. b. macromelasoma were the most similar. On the other hand, dorsal view of structures evidenced some unique characteristics for T. petrocchiae and T. sherlocki. Regarding these structures for T. petrocchiae, the differentiation was in accordance with molecular studies, since this species exhibits the highest genetic distances in relation to other species of T. brasiliensis complex."

Here, we investigated the association of the rs2275913 SNP (G/A) from IL-17A and two forms of susceptibility to CL in Brazil by case-control study. Furthermore, we evaluated the functional relevance of this SNP during the immune response of the host and analyzed its impact in the parasite elimination. Weak associations of A allele with susceptibility to L. braziliensis infection or to symptomatic CL were observed, and a tendency of A allele carriers to be more susceptible to infection and cutaneous disease. Functional analysis of the Th17 cell phenotypes revealed lower frequencies of CD4 + IL-17+ cells in samples of infected people with AA/AG genotypes. Furthermore, people carrying the A allele maintain higher parasite loads, reinforcing the genetic susceptibility findings. This study adds knowledge about the influence of a significant genetic variation on IL-17 promoter on CL pathogenesis, and may contribute to enhance the knowledge about the role of IL-17 in the L. braziliensis infections."

The current treatment for trichomoniasis is based on 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole, known as metronidazole (MTZ). Although effective in clearing the parasite infection, MTZ is related to provoking severe side effects, and it is not recommended during pregnancy. In addition, some strains present resistance to 5'-nitroimidazoles, making urgent the development of alternative drugs for trichomoniasis. Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic drug, exerts a significant anti-parasite effect, mainly due to its interference with calcium homeostasis and the biosynthesis of sterols. Therefore, we decided to test the effect of amiodarone and two other related compounds (amioder and dronedarone) on T. vaginalis. Our observations show that amiodarone stimulated, rather than inhibited, parasite growth, induced cell aggregation, and glycogen accumulation.

Objectives: To review the survival rates of heart transplant patients in the Brazilian Public Health System (Sistema Unico de Saude - SUS) between 2000 and 2015. Methods: This is a non-concurrent, open cohort study, involving cardiac transplant patients in Brazil. The cumulative survival probability was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier curve, and the curve comparison was done using the Log-Rank test. The Cox model was used to calculate the Hazard-Ratio (HR). Analyses were conducted at the 95% confidence level. Results: The heart transplant survival rate median in Brazil, during the period, was 8.3 years. Each additional year in the recipient's age, the occurrence of infections, and the performance of the surgical procedure in the South Region were associated with a higher risk of graft loss. A higher use ratio of immunosuppressants mycophenolate and azathioprine acted as a protection factor. Conclusions: The analyses conducted provide the first information about the median survival time in heart transplant patients in Brazil. The difference noticed among the geographical regions may be related to the different treatment protocols adopted in the country, especially in the early 2000s. The rate of mycophenolate and azathioprine use as a protection factor suggests that, despite the absence of differences among therapeutic strategies, use of these drugs may favor survival of certain patients.

While the overall distribution of histone epigenetic marks differ when comparing the heterochromatin and euchromatin territories in T. infestans, no similar data have been established for other hemipteran reduviids, including P. megistus. In the present work, histone acetylation and methylation marks were investigated in cells of Malpighian tubules of P. megistus 5th instar nymphs using immunocytochemical assays and compared to previously published data for T. infestans. Although similarities between these species were found regarding absence of acetylated H3K9, H4K8 and H4K16, and H3K9me and H3K9me(2) in the chromocenter, presence of these marks in euchromatin, and presence of H3K9me(3) in the chromocenter, no intimate association of acetylated H4K8 and 18S rDNA was revealed in the chromocenter of P. megistus. The elevated abundance of H3K9me(2) marks at the nuclear periphery in P. megistus cells, differing from data for T. infestans, is suggested to reflect differences in the interaction of lamina-associated chromatin domains with the nuclear lamina, methyl-transferase modulation and/or association with the last DNA endoreplication step in 5th instar nymphs, which is a matter for further investigation."

Genotype was defined as cost-effective compared with No Genotype if its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was less than 3 times the 2012 Brazilian per capita GDP of US $12,300.Results:Compared with No genotype, Genotype increased life expectancy from 18.45 to 18.47 years and reduced lifetime cost from US $45,000 to $44,770; thus, in the base case, Genotype was cost saving. Genotype was cost-effective at primary resistance prevalence as low as 1.4% and remained cost-effective when subsequent-line ART costs decreased to 30% of baseline value. Cost-inefficient results were observed only when simultaneously holding multiple parameters to extremes of their plausible ranges.Conclusions:Genotype-resistance testing in ART-naive individuals in Brazil will improve survival and decrease costs and should be incorporated into HIV treatment guidelines in Brazil."

In the present study, we evaluated the Leishmania spp. occurrence in mammals in two conservation units and their surroundings in Brasilia, Federal District (FD), Brazil. Methods: Small mammals were captured in Brasilia National Park (BNP) and Contagem Biological Reserve (CBR) and dogs were sampled in residential areas in their vicinity. Skin and blood samples were evaluated by PCR using different molecular markers (D7 24Sa rRNA and rDNA ITS1). Leishmania species were identified by sequencing of PCR products. Dog blood samples were subjected to the rapid immunochromatographic test (DPP) for detection of anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies. Results: 179 wild mammals were studied and 20.1% had Leishmania DNA successfully detected in at least one sample. Six mammal species were considered infected: Clyomys laticeps, Necromys lasiurus, Nectomys rattus, Rhipidomys macrurus, Didelphis albiventris and Gracilinanus agilis. No significant difference, comparing the proportion of individuals with Leishmania spp., was observed between the sampled areas and wild mammal species. Most of the positive samples were collected from the rodent N. lasiurus, infected by L. amazonensis or L. braziliensis. Moreover, infections by Trypanosoma spp. were detected in N. lasiurus and G. agilis. All 19 dog samples were positive by DPP; however, only three (15.8%) were confirmed by PCR assays. DNA sequences of ITS1 dog amplicons showed 100% identity with L. infantum sequence. Conclusions: The results suggest the participation of six species of wild mammals in the enzootic transmission of Leishmania spp. in FD. This is the first report of L. amazonensis in N. lasiurus."

The therapeutic arsenal routinely employed to treat infected patients is unsatisfactory, especially for pentavalent antimonials, as they are often highly toxic, poorly tolerated and of variable effectiveness. This study aimed to evaluate in vitro the leishmanicidal activity of toxins isolated from Crotalus durissus terrificus venom as a new approach for the treatment of leishmaniasis. Methods: The comparative effects of crotamine, crotoxin, gyrotoxin, convulxin and PLA2 on bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with L. (L.) amazonensis as well as the release of TGF-beta from the treated macrophages were studied. Results and Discussion: Crotamine had the strongest inhibitory effect on parasite growth rate (IC50: 25.65 +/- 0.52 mu g/mL), while convulxcin showed the weakest inhibitory effect (IC50: 52.7 +/- 2.21 mu g/mL). In addition, TGF-beta was significantly reduced after the treatment with all toxins evaluated. Conclusion: The Crotalus durissus terrificus toxins used in this study displayed significant activity against L. (L.) amazonensis, indicating that all of them could be a potential alternative for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis."

In this study, the effects of age, period and birth cohort (APC Effects) on the evolution of the mortality of that disease in Brazil, from 1980-2014, according to sex and geographic region of the country, were analyzed. Mortality forecasts from the years 2015 to 2034 were estimated. Methods This is an ecological cross-sectional study in which death records and population data were extracted from the DATASUS (Department of Information Technology of the National Health System) website, in age groups from 20-24 years of age to 80 years and over, from 1980 to 2014. The rates were standardized according to age and sex distributions using the direct method. The APC models were estimated using the Bayesian approach, and the INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations) method was used for parameter inference. Super dispersion of the data was considered, and we included unstructured random terms in the models. Results During the analyzed period, there were 178,823 deaths in Brazil (3.85 annual deaths per 100,000 inhabitants). It was found that temporal effects on CD mortality varied by sex and region. In general, there was an increase in mortality rates up to 30 years of age, and the mortality rates were higher between 50 and 64 years of age. On average, men died five years younger than women. Mortality rates were highest in the Central West and Southeast regions. The Central West, Southeast and Southern regions had a reduction over time in the rate of CD deaths between 2000 and 2014. The mortality rate in the Northeast was not statistically different in any period analyzed, while the North had tendency to increase; however, a significant risk increase was only observed between 1995 and 1999. The rate of mortality was high in older birth cohorts. The overall prediction for the next two decades showed a progressive decline in CD mortality, which will be highest among the young. The expected average reduction was 76.1% compared to the last observed period (2010-2014) and the last predicted (2030-2034) period. The average reduction ranged from 86% in the 20-24 age group to 50% in the 80 and over age group. Conclusions In the present study, a higher death rate was observed for ages above 30 years, especially 50 to 64 years, and in the older birth cohorts. We believe these results can be related to period effects of vector control actions and preventive and care measures by the health system of Brazil, in addition to demographic changes in the period. The differences among the regions reflect socioeconomic inequities and access to the healthcare systems in the Brazilian population."

This work exploits Low-Energy X-Ray Microfluorescence (LEXRF) to evaluate the distribution of oxygen and sodium in the structures of the insect Rhodnius prolixus, and to understand the effects of azadirachtin treatment. Specimens of fifth-instar nymphs of Rhodnius prolixus were taken from the colony of the Laboratory of Biochemistry and Physiology of Insects (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Brazil) and were divided in two groups. In the first group, the insects were fed with defibrinated rabbit blood containing azadirachtin and the other group only with simply defibrinated rabbit blood. Both groups were examined at the TwinMic soft X-ray microscopy synchrotron beamline, (Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste, Trieste, Italy), providing elemental map distribution of oxygen which was correlated to the high-resolution morphological information obtained by the simultaneous absorption and differential phase contrast images. Prior to Low-Energy X-Ray Microfluorescence (LEXRF) measurements two control samples were scanned at the SYRMEP beamline (Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste, Trieste, Italy) by microtomography for an overview of the structures that were subsequently studied at TwinMic.

Methods: Patients with CCC, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to IV and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 50% or below were included. A randomization list using blocks of 2 and 4 and an allocation rate of 1:1 was generated by R software which was stratified by functional class. Double blinding was done to both arms and assessors were masked to allocations. All patients received standard heart failure treatment for 2 months before 1:1 randomization to either the G-CSF (10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneously) or placebo group (1 mL of 0.9% saline subcutaneously). The primary endpoint was either maintenance or improvement of NYHA class from baseline to 6-12 months after treatment, and intention-to-treat analysis was used. Results: We screened 535 patients with CCC in Salvador, Brazil, of whom 37 were randomized. Overall, baseline characteristics were well-balanced between groups. Most patients had NYHA class II heart failure (86.4%); low mean LVEF was 32 & PLUSMN; 7% in the G-CSF group and 33 & PLUSMN; 10% in the placebo group.

G-CSF treatment was safe, without any related serious adverse events. There was no difference in mortality between both arms, with five deaths (18.5%) in treatment vs. four (12.5%) in the placebo arm. Exploratory analysis demonstrated that the maximum rate of oxygen consumption during exercise (VO2 max) showed an improving trend in the G-CSF group.

Using nine microsatellite loci, we characterized one residual T. infestans population from Bahia and four from Rio Grande do Sul, and compared them with bugs originally from an older focus in So Paulo; 224 bugs were genotyped. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 5 to 11. Observed and expected heterozygosities per locus ranged, respectively, from 0 to 0.786 and from 0 to 0.764. Significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, mainly due to heterozygote deficits, were detected in all loci and in most populations. Global indices estimated by AMOVA were: Fis was 0.37; Fst was 0.28; and Fit was 0.55; overall indices with p = 0.00 indicated substantial differentiation. Inter-population Fst ranged from 0.118 to 0.562, suggesting strong genetic structuring and little to no gene flow among populations. Intra-population Fis ranged from 0.301 to 0.307. Inbreeding was apparent in all populations except that from Bahia-which might be either linked by gene flow to nearby unsampled populations or part of a relatively large local population. The overall pattern of strong genetic structuring among pyrethroid-susceptible residual T. infestans populations suggests that their persistence is probably due to operational control failures. Detection and elimination of such residual foci is technically feasible and must become a public health priority in Brazil."

Data were collected from official health information systems. Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) were estimated by the sum of Years of Life Lost (YLL) and Years Lived with Disability (YLD). 45,237.33 DALYs were estimated, with a rate of 685.46 DALYs per 100,000 population. 92.9% was due to YLL and 7.1% to YLD. Men and the age range of 0-4 years presented higher burden. The highest burden was attributed to HIV/AIDS. There was a high concentration of burden rates in the coast regions of the state. It could be concluded that more than 90% of the burden was attributed to the early mortality component. The highest burden was observed among men, children under 5 years of age and at the coast regions of the state. The highest levels of burden were due to HIV/AIDS.

The expansion of canine leishmaniasis from geographical areas of Brazil in which the infection is endemic to regions in which the disease is emerging is occurring. This fact makes necessary the analysis of the serodiagnostic capabilities of different leishmanial preparations in distinct geographical locations. In this article sera from dogs infected with Leishmania and showing the clinical form of the disease, were collected in three distinct Brazilian States and were tested against soluble leishmanial antigens or seven parasite individual antigens produced as recombinant proteins. We show that the recognition of soluble leishmanial antigens by sera from these animals was influenced by the geographical location of the infected dogs. Efficacy of the diagnosis based on this crude parasite preparation was higher in newly endemic regions when compared with areas of high disease endemicity. We also show that the use of three of the recombinant proteins, namely parasite surface kinetoplastid membrane protein of 11 kDa (KMP-11), and two members of the P protein family (P2a and PO), can improve the degree of sensitivity without adversely affecting the specificity of the diagnostic assays for canine leishmaniasis, independently of the geographical area of residence. In addition, sera from dogs clinically healthy but infected were also assayed with some of the antigen preparations. We demonstrate that the use of these proteins can help to the serodiagnosis of Leishmania infected animals with subclinical infections. Finally, we propose a diagnostic protocol using a combination of KMP-11, P2a y P0, together with total leishmanial extracts. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The age group with the highest prevalence for discards changed: it used to be the 40-59 years old group in 2003, and became the 20-39 years old group in 2012. Conclusion: There was an increase in the number of donations in Hemobanco and a decrease in total discards due to seropositive donations. Most donors were male. The most prevalent cause of discards only amongst seropositive donation discards is seropositivity for anti-HBc. There was a significant increase of donors aged between 20 and 39 years old.

Although several authors assume that the speciation process that supports this differentiation in T. sordida is the result of cryptic speciation, further morphological and/or morphometric studies are necessary to prove the application of this evolutionary event, because the only morphological intraspecific comparison performed in T. sordida is based on geometric morphometry and the only interspecific comparison made is between T. rosai and T. sordida from Brazil that evaluated morphological and morphometric differences. Based on this, morphological analyses of thorax and abdomen using Scanning Electron Microscopy and morphometric analyses of the head, thorax, and abdomen among T. sordida from Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay, as well as T. rosai, were performed to assess whether the evolutionary process responsible for variations is the cryptic speciation phenomenon. Morphological differences in the thorax and female external genitalia, as well as morphometric differences in the head, thorax, abdomen, pronotum, and scutellum structures, were observed. Based on this, the evolutionary process that supports, so far, these divergences observed for T. sordida populations/T. sordida subcomplex is not cryptic speciation.

In addition to Brazil, this species has already been reported in Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. It is hypothesized that the insects currently identified as T. sordida are a species subcomplex formed by three cytotypes (T. sordida sensu stricto T. sordida La Paz, and T. sordida Argentina). With the recent description of T. rosai from the Argentinean specimens, it became necessary to assess the taxonomic status of T. sordida from La Paz, Bolivia, since it was suggested that it may represent a new species, which has taxonomic, evolutionary, and epidemiological implications. Based on the above, we carried out molecular and experimental crossover studies to assess the specific status of T. sordida La Paz. Methods: To evaluate the pre- and postzygotic barriers between T. sordida La Paz and T. sordida s.s., experimental crosses and intercrosses between F1 hybrids and between F2 hybrids were conducted. In addition, cytogenetic analyses of the F1 and F2 hybrids were applied with an emphasis on the degree of pairing between the homeologous chromosomes, and morphological analyses of the male gonads were performed to evaluate the presence of gonadal dysgenesis. Lastly, the genetic distance between T sordida La Paz and T sordida s.s. was calculated for the CYTB, ND1, and 1TS1 genes. Results: Regardless of the gene used, T. sordida La Paz showed low genetic distance compared to T sordida s.s. (below 2%). Experimental crosses resulted in off spring for both directions, demonstrating that there are no prezygotic barriers installed between these allopatric populations. Furthermore, postzygotic barriers were not observed either (since the F1 x F1 and F2 x F2 intercrosses resulted in viable offspring). Morphological and cytogenetic analyses of the male gonads of the F1 and F2 offspring demonstrated that the testes were not atrophied and did not show chromosome pairing errors. Conclusion: Based on the low genetic distance (which configures intraspecific variation), associated with the absence of prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive barriers, we confirm that T. sordida La Paz represents only a chromosomal polymorphism of T. sordida s."

In the case of a medically important taxon, i.e., a disease vector, inferences on species survival and dispersal rates are particularly important as they have the potential to provide insights into disease transmission dynamics in endemic areas. Medical entomologists have traditionally used fluorescent dusts to externally mark the cuticle of insects. However, dust marking is usually restricted to the adult life stage because immature insects lose the mark when they molt. Methodology/Principal Findings We evaluated the efficacy of 13 trace elements in marking nymphs of three native Brazilian Chagas disease vectors: Triatoma brasiliensis, Triatoma pseudomaculata, and Rhodnius nasutus. Cr and Cu were detected in over 97% of T. brasiliensis (34/35 31/31 for Cr and Cu), while Cu and Mn were detected in more than 95% of T. pseudomaculata (29/29 for Cu and 28/29 for Mn) tested 120 days after marking. Only Mn marked over 90% of R. nasutus nymphs (38/41). Overall, trace elements had no negative effects on T. pseudomaculata longevity, but As-marked T. brasiliensis nymphs (p<0.01), and Cd-marked R. nasutus nymphs (p<0.01) had significantly shorter lifespan. Conclusions/Significance Previous evidence shows that there is little or no genetic differentiation between populations at the microgeographic level, which often precludes indirect estimations of dispersal capability based on genetic markers. In such situations, MRR studies are more suitable as they measure insect movement directly from one site to another, instead of effective migration (i.e. gene flow). The determination of a reliable and persistent marking method is the first step towards the development of meaningful ecological estimates through the application of MRR methodology. Here, we have identified trace elements that can be used for mark and recapture studies of three triatomine species in Brazil."

Recently, regularity functions have been proposed to control the excessive freedom of the shape of spatial clusters whenever the spatial scan statistic is used. We present a novel scan statistic algorithm employing a function based on the geographical dispersion to penalize the presence of a huge gap between the areas in candidate clusters, the dispersion function. The proposed multi-objective scan maximize the spatial scan and minimize the dispersion function, using particle swarm optimization. We show that, compared to the non-connectivity regularity function, the multi-objective scan with dispersion function is faster and suited for the detection of moderately irregularly shaped clusters. An application is presented using comprehensive state-wide data for Chagas' disease in puerperal women in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. We show that, the multi-objective approach with the dispersion function is a promising algorithm for the detection of irregularly shaped clusters."

Researches that can reinforce the existence and persistence of this problem, as well as bring concrete alternatives are pivotal. In this context, the aim of this work was to evaluate and compare the serological, molecular and parasitological methods employed for CVL detection in Brazil, in dogs with diverse clinical profiles, from two endemic areas of Pernambuco state. Comparisons among TR-DPP., EIE-LVC and qPCR (animals from Goiana-PE: 91) demonstrated that agreements varied from 'poor' to 'moderate' (kappa = 0.162-0.442), and a triple agreement occurred in 61.36% (54/88) of the samples. The highest percentage of agreement was obtained between TR-DPP. and EIE-LVC within the polysymptomatic group (93.33%; 14/15). Of the 34 dogs with reagent serology from Caruaru-PE, 17 (50%) and 29 dogs (85.29%) were positive for qPCR and parasitological exam, respectively. By comparing serology, qPCR and parasitological exam, the lowest percentage of agreements were obtained within the asymptomatic group (40%-72.72%). It was possible to observe that the percentage of agreement tended to decrease according to the absence of clinical manifestations in the dogs. Thus, from the fact that all diagnostic tools evaluated have their limitations, it is very important to be careful before to propose an alternative set of diagnostic criteria. Besides, the answer for better results in the control of CVL may not be in the choose of the best set of diagnostic tools, but it may be in the strategy of culling itself. In this context, it is very important to invest in alternative control measures, such as mass vaccination and treatment of dogs, thus reducing the transmission to the vector and helping to avoid new canine and human cases."

Leishmania promastigotes are transmitted by the vector and differentiate into amastigotes within phagocytic cells of the vertebrate host. To survive in multiple and hostile environments, the parasite has several virulence factors. Oligopeptidase B (OPB) is a serine peptidase present in prokaryotes, some eukaryotes and some higher plants. It has been considered a virulence factor in trypanosomatids, but only a few studies, performed with Old World species, analysed its role in Leishmania virulence or infectivity. L. (L.) amazonensis is an important agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Brazil. The L. (L.) amazonensis OPB encoding gene has been sequenced and analysed in silico but has never been expressed. In this work, we produced recombinant L. (L.) amazonensis OPB and showed that its pH preferences, Km and inhibition patterns are similar to those reported for L. (L.) major and L. (L.) donovani OPBs. Since Leishmania is known to secrete OPB, we performed in vitro infection assays using the recombinant enzyme. Our results showed that active OPB increased in vitro infection by L. (L.) amazonensis when present before and throughout infection. Our findings suggest that OPB is relevant to L. (L.) amazonensis infection, and that potential drugs acting through OPB will probably be effective for Old and New World Leishmania species.

Mortality from NTDs is a phenomenon observed primarily in people over 50 and men. The trend in the age-adjusted NTD death rates shows a statistically significant decline between 1991 and 2016, with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) for both sexes of -3.98 (CI 95%: -4.69; -3.25). In terms of the selected diseases, a steady decline in the rates for echinococcus is observed in the period 1991-2016, while two periods can be identified for Chagas, one in which the decline is significant (1991-2008) and another in which it is not (2008-2016).

Population analysis performed with AMOVA, haplotype network and Mantel test estimated the veracity of the demes. The F-ST shows structuring for the five demes, with dm 1 (South region) isolated from the others, however the other analysis showed the Northeast/Southeast demes (dm 2-5) united, diagnosing gene flow between them, mainly at the transitional zones, in areas as far away as areas with similar latitude interval (Southeast vs South) that was not detected gene flow. In the haplotype network, the mutational steps was conclusive in split dm 1 from dm 2-5 with 15 mutational steps and the Mantel test was moderated, which is explained by genetic similarity despite the great geographic distances (Northeast/Southeast). Thus, our analysis recognized two different lineages (South and Northeast/Southeast) and indicate that the biomes were not decisive in their isolation. The sharing of demes at the transitional zones and in areas with high latitudinal intervals reflects a recent ancestral polymorphism for D. albiventris. The plasticity in the occupation of the space by this species contributes in its wide dispersion capability, that is, geographical distribution.

All HIV-1 infected patients who started combination antiretroviral therapy up to 30 days before or within 180 days after the start of tuberculosis treatment from 2000 to 2010 were eligible. Causes of death were categorized according to the ""Coding Causes of Death in HIV"" (CoDe) protocol. The Cox model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of selected mortality variables. Results: A total of 310 patients were included. Sixty-four patients died during the study period. Mortality rate following tuberculosis treatment initiation was 44 per 100 person-years within the first 30 days, 28.1 per 100 person-years within 31 and 90 days, 6 per 100 person-years within 91 and 365 days and 1.6 per 100 person-years after 365 days. Death probability within one year from tuberculosis treatment initiation was approximately 13%. In the adjusted analysis the associated factors with mortality were: CD4 <= 50 cells/mm(3) (HR: 3.10; 95% CI: 1.720 to 5.580; p = 0.00); mechanical ventilation (HR: 2.81; 95% CI: 1.170 to 6.760; p = 0.02); and disseminated tuberculosis (HR: 3.70; 95% CI: 1.290 to 10.590, p = 0.01). Invasive bacterial disease was the main immediate cause of death (46.9%). Conclusion: Our results evidence the high morbidity and mortality among patients co-infected with HIV-1 and tuberculosis in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. During the first year following tuberculosis diagnosis, mortality was the highest within the first 3 months, being invasive bacterial infection the major cause of death. In order to successfully intervene in this scenario, it is utterly necessary to address the social determinants of health contributing to the inequitable health care access faced by this population."

The riverside people are a group of people who live in floating houses and/or on the banks of rivers, they are low-income communities, live off what nature provides, from their own crafts and plantations, they experience many difficulties and dangers. It is a population vulnerable to various types of diseases and has little access to health care, which causes them to seek healing for their problems directly from nature and their mystical beliefs. This is all related to the condition of life that the riverside dwellers live in - lack of sanitation, need for adequate health care, eating habits, and precarious housing conditions. Knowing this reality, this study aims to discuss the promotion of health to riverside people. The research consists of a descriptive literature review conducted through databases. The riverine community needs basic resources such as sanitation, good quality electricity, and more frequent health care. They depend on urban areas to buy utensils, food, and other services that they need, and especially to have health care. To travel by boat on the river to the city takes hours or even days of travel. The river dwellers are susceptible to infectious diseases such as malaria, viral hepatitis, anemia, diseases caused by parasites, contamination through water and food, mercury contamination through fish, Chagas disease, diabetes, and hypertension. There are several programs already implemented that should reach all riverside communities, some of them are the Family Health Strategies (FHS), municipal, state and federal government authorities, Brazil without misery, citizenship territories, national food security plan, stork network , affectionate Brazil and smiling Brazil. Although they already provide care in part of these communities, extensions are needed to reach 100% of them, and thus prevent the spread of diseases and provide the right to health for all. Given this context, it is important to further improve the public policies aimed at the health of this population, to launch new strategies, and to improve the existing ones, taking into account the principle that health care must follow the direction of the specific needs of the groups, thus being a dynamic and permanent challenge. The riverside dwellers have the right to know and receive all the actions directed to them, ensuring the right to health in all dimensions included in the principles that organize and guide the SUS."

Experimental crosses from each of these members of the T. brasiliensis species complex generated fertile offspring suggesting that viable hybrids could be present in nature, despite their significant genetic distances. Considering the geographical position of occurrence of the T. b. macromelasoma (in Pernambuco) it was proposed to be an area capable of supporting natural hybridization between T. b. brasiliensis and T. juazeirensis. Since phenotypic variability is expected, this study investigated the existence of intermediate chromatic phenotypes for T. b. macromelasoma in various locations in areas between the T. b. brasiliensis and T. juazeirensis occurrences. Thirteen different color patterns were for the first time characterized and nine of those displayed intermediate phenotypes. Molecular analysis performed using ribosomal DNA intergenic region, grouped all within the T. brasiliensis complex.

Serological tests are the most common diagnostic methods employed, but most have limitations. For this reason, the implementation of a rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic test for CVL has become increasingly important. In this study, we adapted a chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CL ELISA), using two multi-epitope recombinant proteins (PQ10 and PQ20) and a crude Leishmania antigen produced using promastigotes of L. infantum, as antigens to detect CVL infection in animals from Belo Horizonte. To investigate cross-reactions, samples from dogs with other infections (babesiosis, ehrlichiosis and Trypanosoma cruzi) were tested. Assay performance validations were conducted to analyse parameters such as variability, reproducibility, and stability. CL ELISA sensitivity/specificity with PQ10 antigen was 93.1%/80.0%; with the PQ20 protein 93.1%/96.6%; and with the crude antigen 75%/73.3%. Inter-assay variability and inter-operator coefficient of variation were <7% and <15%, with PQ10 and PQ20, respectively. The accuracy of the CL ELISA was classified as excellent for PQ10 (AUC = 0.95) and PQ20 (AUC = 0.98) and moderate for the crude antigen (AUC = 0.77). The kappa score for qualitative agreement between two plate lots was excellent for PQ10 (0.89) and good for PQ20 (0.65). PQ20 remained more stable than PQ10.

For laboratory tests, none of the assays available can be considered gold standards for disease detection. In addition, the Montenegro skin test, essential to supporting infectologists in the clinical management of the disease, is no longer available in Brazil. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop new targets to be used in diagnostic tests for HTL.

In Brazil, the guidelines for STDs diagnosis and treatment are based on the syndromic approach. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) has been recommended as routine STDs screening in some countries, especially for men who have sex with men (MSM). Limited data are available about how to best define target groups for routine screening by NAATs within this population. We aimed to assess the prevalence of rectal and urethral Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infections and syphilis, and the factors associated with having at least one STD among HIV-infected and uninfected MSM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Methods: From August 2010 to June 2012, 391 MSM were enrolled into the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases-INI-Fiocruz cohort, and 292 MSM (HIV-infected: 211 and HIV-uninfected: 81) were included in this study. NAATs were performed on the rectal swabs and urine for CT and NG. The rapid plasma reagin test and microhemagglutination assay for Treponema pallidum were performed for syphilis diagnosis. Results: The overall prevalence of STD was 20.0 % (95% CI: 15.7-25.1): 10 % anorectal chlamydia; syphilis 9.9 %; anorectal gonorrheae 2.5 %; and urethral chlamydia 2.2 %; no case of urethral gonorrheae was detected. The proportion of HIV-positive MSM who had at least one STD was nearly two times that of HIV-negative MSM (22.6 % vs 13.2 %; P = 0.09). The frequency of each STD, except for anorectal NG (1.5 % vs. 5.2 %), was higher among HIV-positive than HIV-negative individuals. Among the 211 asymptomatic participants, 17.5 % (n = 37) were identified as having at least one STD; 10.4 % (n = 22/211) tested positive for anorectal chlamydia. Sixty five percent of HIV-positive MSM were asymptomatic at the time of the STD diagnosis, while 100.0 % of the HIV-negative MSM. Age (APR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.60-1.00 for each additional ten years) and a positive-HIV serostatus (APR = 2.05; 95% CI: 1.03-4.08) were significantly associated with STD diagnosis. Conclusion: An overall high STD-prevalence rate was observed, especially among HIV-infected and in younger individuals, and the majority of STDs were asymptomatic. STD screening using NAATs among asymptomatic MSM is a potentially cost-effective intervention for the prevention of HIV infection among MSM."

Furthermore, there are few studies that analyzed the structure and genetic variability of specimens from Brazil and that showed low genetic diversity and strong genetic structuring of the population samples. Therefore, because of great epidemiological importance of T. sordida and mainly the restriction of genetic characterization of this vector only for populations of Minas Gerais state, this article performs a genetic analysis of the T. sordida from seven different Brazilian states (representing different biomes), by means of cytogenetic markers. All analyzed specimens presents the same cytogenetic characteristics: early meiotic prophase with several heterochromatic bodies dispersed in the nucleus (CGrich), being one of them formed by the associated sex chromosomes surrounded by some autosomal heterochromatic regions, meiotic metaphase with most autosomal pairs exhibiting a C-heterochromatic block in one chromosomal end (CG-rich), Y sex chromosome fully heterochromatin (AT-rich), and X chromosome may present a small C-block (CG-rich). These results are important because the chromosomal markers enable to confirm and expand the low genetic diversity for all Brazilian states occupied by T. sordida, suggesting that all Brazilian populations were originated from a small ancestral population and possibly dispersed to other biomes by founder effect. In addition, we suggest that T. sordida from Brazil are not suffering cryptic speciation and we confirm the classification of all Brazilian examples as T. sordida sensu stricto."

However, oftentimes, the different diseases and regions are not uniformly represented, scarcity or lack of publications in some countries is common. The objectives of this work were to analyze the distribution and abundance of publications on vector-borne diseases associated with climate variability in South America, identify those works that conducted a geographic analysis and detect the countries where outbreaks occurred and the climate variables with which they were associated. A systematic review of the literature published on vector-borne diseases linked to climate variability in South America was conducted, identifying, evaluating and summarizing scientific papers. The distribution of the study areas and disease type in the publications were represented on maps. Dengue and leishmaniasis were the most studied and widely represented diseases in South America. The country with the largest number of published papers and presence of all disease types was Brazil. Outbreaks of disease were related to different climate variables. Most diseases from the publications under study occurred in equatorial and tropical climates. The disease represented by the largest number of different types of climates was dengue. The technique used in this work allowed us to determine the status of knowledge of the main diseases associated with climate variability in South America. This methodology could be improved in the future by incorporating other bibliographic sources as well as other diseases related to climate variability. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

We investigated whether socioeconomic inequalities exist in access to treatment in a setting with universal access to care and treatment.MethodsThis study investigated the association of educational level, used as a proxy for socioeconomic status, with late treatment initiation and treatment initiation with advanced disease. Study participants included adults (>= 25years) who started treatment from 2005 to 2018 at Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas of FundacAo Oswaldo Cruz (INI/FIOCRUZ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Educational level was categorized following UNESCO's International Standard Classification of Education: incomplete basic education, basic education, secondary level, and tertiary level. We defined late treatment initiation as those initiating treatment with a CD4<350 cells/mL or an AIDS-defining event, and treatment initiation with advanced disease as those initiating treatment with a CD4<200 cells/mL or an AIDS-defining event. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) was constructed to represent the theoretical-operational model and to understand the involvement of covariates. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Multiple imputation using a chained equations approach was used to treat missing values and non-linear terms for continuous variables were tested.ResultsIn total, 3226 individuals composed the study population: 876 (27.4%) had incomplete basic education, 540 (16.9%) basic, 1251 (39.2%) secondary level, and 525 (16.4%) tertiary level. Late treatment initiation was observed for 2076 (64.4%) while treatment initiation with advanced disease was observed for 1423 (44.1%). Compared to tertiary level of education, incomplete basic, basic and secondary level increased the odds of late treatment initiation by 89% (aOR:1.89 95%CI:1.47-2.43), 61% (aOR:1.61 95%CI:1.23-2.10), and 35% (aOR:1.35 95%CI:1.09-1.67). Likewise, the odds of treatment initiation with advanced disease was 2.5-fold (aOR:2.53 95%CI:1.97-3.26), 2-fold (aOR:2.07 95%CI:1.59-2.71), 1.5-fold (aOR:1.51 95%CI:1.21-1.88) higher for those with incomplete basic, basic and secondary level education compared to tertiary level.ConclusionDespite universal access to HIV care and antiretroviral treatment, late treatment initiation and social inequalities persist. Lower educational level significantly increased the odds of both outcomes, reinforcing the existence of barriers to ""universal"" antiretroviral treatment."

Dwellings and rocks are considered high-quality microhabitats for this saxicolous species, whereas cacti probably represent secondary, lower-quality microhabitats. This 'microhabitat-quality hierarchy' hypothesis predicts that T. brasiliensis populations occupying dwellings or rocks should endure harsh environmental conditions better than their cactus-living relatives. Methods/Findings We tested this prediction by comparing T. brasiliensis infestation (proportion of microhabitats with bugs), density (bugs per microhabitat), and crowding (bugs per infested microhabitat) in dwellings, rocks, and cacti sampled before and during the extreme drought that ravaged the Caatinga in 2012-2016. We used random-intercepts generalized linear mixed models to account for microhabitat spatial clustering and for variations in bug-catch effort; we assessed model performance and computed model-averaged effect estimates using Akaike's information criterion. Pre-drought infestation was similar across microhabitat types; during the drought, infestation remained stable in dwellings and rocks but dropped in cacti. Pre-drought bug density declined from dwellings to rocks to cacti; an additional decline associated with the drought was largely comparable across microhabitats, albeit perhaps somewhat larger in cacti. Finally, pre-drought bug crowding was higher in dwellings than in rocks or cacti and changed little during the drought-possibly with a downward trend in dwellings and an upward trend in cacti. Conclusions Triatoma brasiliensis populations fared better in dwellings and rocks than in cacti during extreme drought. Estimates of microhabitat and drought effects on infestation, density, and crowding suggest that only a few cacti (versus many rocks and dwellings) represent good-quality habitat under such extremely harsh conditions. Our findings provide empirical support to the microhabitat-quality hierarchy hypothesis, and imply that T. brasiliensis can endure extreme climate by exploiting high-quality microhabitats, whether wild or man-made, in the semiarid Caatinga."

The objective of this study was to conduct a trend analysis of TTIs and associated demographic factors of donors at a public blood bank in the central Brazil. Methods: A retrospective analysis (2010-2016) of blood donation data was performed to determine the prevalence of markers for TTIs. Multinomial and multivariate logistic regression were used to verify the association between the explanatory variables and TTIs. The trend was evaluated with the Prais Winsten's regression analysis. Results: The prevalence of TTIs was 4.04% (5,553 donors) among 137,209 donors, with a steady trend in the analyzed period. The seroprevalence for the hepatitis B virus (HBV), syphilis, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Chagas disease, and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) were 1.63%, 0.87%, 0.46%, 0.21%, 0.21% and 0.09%, respectively. The prevalence of HBV decreased (b = -0.021, p < 0.001), while syphilis increased (b = 0.112; p = 0.001), during the period investigated. The probability for a positive test for TTI was higher among donors with a low level of education, aged >= 30 years old, without stable marital status, and first-time donors. Conclusions: Even with the reduction in HBV, the increased rate of syphilis may have contributed to the fact that the overall rate of TTIs did not decrease in the evaluated period.

This study aimed to estimate their prevalence and provide a detailed analysis of geographical distribution of intestinal parasites in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro, considering demographic, socio-economic, and epidemiological contextual factors. Methods/ Principal findings The cross-section survey was conducted among individuals attending the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (FIOCRUZ, RJ) during the period from April 2012 to February 2015. Stool samples were collected and processed by sedimentation, flotation, Kato-Katz, Baermann-Moraes and Graham methods, iron haematoxylin staining and safranin staining. Of the 3245 individuals analysed, 569 (17.5%) were infected with at least one parasite. The most common protozoa were Endolimax nana (28.8%), Entamoeba coli (14.8%), Complex Entamoeba histolytica/Entamoeba dispar (13.5%), Blastocystis hominis (12.7%), and Giardia lamblia (8.1%). Strongyloides stercoralis (4.3%), Schistosoma mansoni (3.3%), Ascaris lumbricoides (1.6%), and hookworms (1.5%) were the most frequent helminths. There was a high frequency of contamination by protozoa (87%), and multiple infections were observed in 141 participants (24.8%). A positive association between age (young children) and gender (male) with intestinal parasites was observed. Geospatial distribution of the detected intestinal parasitic infections was not random or homogeneous, but was influenced by socioeconomic conditions (through the material deprivation index (MDI)). Participants classified in the highest levels of deprivation had higher risk of having intestinal parasites. Conclusions/Significance This study provides the first epidemiological information on the prevalence and distribution of intestinal parasitic infections in the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area. Intestinal parasites, especially protozoa, are highly prevalent, indicating that parasitic infections are still a serious public health problem. MDI showed that intestinal parasites were strongly associated with the socioeconomic status of the population, thus making it possible to identify social vulnerable areas."

In Brazil, the effect of annual climate variations on Aedes aegypti and dengue epidemics in large cities like Sao Paulo is well known, but little is known about how such variations can affect the diversity of mosquito vectors in urban parks and the risk of disease transmission by these vectors. This study investigates the influence of larval habitats and seasonal factors on the diversity and abundance of Culicidae fauna in Anhanguera Park, one of the largest remaining green areas in the city of Sao Paulo. Species composition and richness and larval habitats were identified. Seasonality (cold-dry and hot-rainy periods) and year were considered as explanatory variables and the models selection approach was developed to investigate the relationship of these variables with mosquito diversity and abundance. A total of 11,036 specimens from 57 taxa distributed in 13 genera were collected. Culex nigripalpus, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Aedes albopictus were the most abundant species. Bamboo internodes and artificial breeding sites showed higher abundance, while ponds and puddles showed greater richness. Significant relationships were observed between abundance and seasonality, with a notable increase in the mosquitos abundance in the warm-rainy periods. The Shannon and Berger Parker indices were related with interaction between seasonality and year, however separately these predictors showed no relationship with ones. The increased abundance of mosquitoes in warm-rainy months and the fact that some of the species are epidemiologically important increase not only the risk of pathogen transmission to people who frequent urban parks but also the nuisance represented by insect bites. The findings of this study highlight the importance of knowledge of culicid ecology in green areas in urban environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of ICD and CRT-D therapies within the Brazilian National Health System (SUS). Methods: All patients who underwent ICD or CRT-D implantation within the SUS from 2001 to 2007 were included in the study. We compared estimated Kaplan-Meier survival curves using the Peto's test. Prognostic factors were selected using Cox's models. Results: There were included 3,295 patients in the ICD group and 681 patients in the CRT-D group. Cardiac causes accounted for 79% of all deaths in both groups and Chagas' heart disease accounted for 31% of these deaths. In the CRT-D group, survival significantly decreased around the fourth year of follow-up, with a decrease from 59.5% to 38.3% in 5.5 months. Transvenous implantation technique was used in 62% of CRT-D patients. In-hospital case-fatality rates were higher in those undergoing surgical implantation (5.3%) than those undergoing transvenous implantation (1.6%) (p = 0.02). Conclusions: The results show that short-term, medium-term and long-term effectiveness of ICD therapy appears to be similar to that evidenced in clinical trials. In the CRT-D group, in-hospital case-fatality and 30-day case-fatality were higher than those reported in other studies. Surgical epicardial implantation technique was performed in this group at a higher frequency than that reported in the literature and was associated with poorer short-term prognosis."

The diagnosis is achieved on a clinical, epidemiological, and pathological basis, supported by positive parasitological exams and demonstration of leishmanin delayedtype hypersensitivity. Serological assays are not routinely used in the diagnosis because many are considered to have low sensitivity and the particular Leishmania species causing the disease can lead to variable performance. In the present study, we generated recombinant versions of two highly conserved Leishmania proteins, Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis-derived Lb8E and Lb6H, and evaluated both in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Recombinant Lb6H (rLb6H) had better performance and reacted with 100.0% of the ATL and 89.4% of the VL samples. These reactions with rLb6H were highly specific (98.5%) when compared against those for samples from healthy control individuals. We then assessed rLb6H against sera from ATL patients infected with different species of Leishmania prevalent in Brazil [Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis, L. (Viannia) braziliensis, and L. (V.) guyanensis] and samples from patients with other infectious diseases. In analyses of 500 sera, ELISA using rLb6H detected all 219 ATL samples (sensitivity of 100.0%) with an overall specificity of 93.9% (considering healthy individuals and other infectious diseases patients). Only a minority of samples from Chagas disease patients possessed antibodies against rLb6H, and all of these responses were low (with a highest reactivity index of 2.2).

Some morphological similarities among species make taxonomic identification, population differentiation and species delimitation controversial. Triatoma garciabesi and T. sordida are the most similar species, having been considered alternatively two and a single species until T. garciabesi was re-validated, mostly based on the morphology of male genitalia. More recently, T. sordida from Argentina has been proposed as a new cryptic species distinguishable from T. sordida from Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay by cytogenetics. We studied linear and geometric morphometry of the head, wings and pronotum in populations of these species aiming to find phenotypic markers for their discrimination, especially between T. sordida and T. garciabesi, and if any set of variables that validates T. sordida from Argentina as a new species. Results: Head width and pronotum length were the linear variables that best differentiated species. Geometric morphometry revealed significant Mahalanobis distances in wing shape between all pairwise comparisons. Triatoma patagonica exhibited the best discrimination and T. garciabesi overlapped the distribution of the other species in the morphometric space of the first two DFA axes. Head shape showed differentiation between all pairs of species except for T. garciabesi and T. sordida. Pronotum shape did not differentiate T. garciabesi from T. guasayana. The comparison between T. garciabesi and T. sordida from Argentina and T. sordida from Brazil and Bolivia revealed low differentiation based on head and pronotum linear measurements. Pronotum and wing shape were different between T. garciabesi and T. sordida from Brazil and Bolivia and T. sordida from Argentina. Head shape did not differentiate T. garciabesi from T. sordida from Argentina. Conclusions: Wing shape best delimited the four species phenotypically. The proposed cryptic species, T. sordida from Argentina, differed from T. sordida from Brazil and Bolivia in all measured shape traits, suggesting that the putative new species may not be cryptic. Additional studies integrating cytogenetic, phenotypic and molecular markers, as well as cross-breeding experiments are needed to confirm if these three entities represent true biological species."

This study aimed to characterize the EBV genotypes of infectious mononucleosis (IM) cases in the metropolitan region of Belem, Brazil, from 2005 to 2016. A total of 8295 suspected cases with symptoms/signs of IM were investigated by infectious disease physicians at Evandro Chagas Institute, Health Care Service, from January 2005 to December 2016. Out of the total, 1645 (19.8%) samples had positive results for EBV by enzyme immunoassay and 251 (15.3%) were submitted to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, using the EBNA3C region, in order to determine the type of EBV. Biochemical testing involving aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and gammaglutamyl transferase were also performed. EBV type was identified by PCR in 30.3% (76/251) of individuals; of those, 71.1% (54/76) were classified as EBV1, 17.1% (13/76) as EBV2, and 11.8% (9/76) as EBV1 + EBV2. The main symptoms/signs observed with EBV1 infection were cervical lymphadenopathy (64.8%, 35/54), fever (63%, 34/54), headache (20.4%, 11/54), arthralgia (20.4%, 11/54), and exanthema (18.5%, 10/54). EBV2 infection was detected in all but two age groups, with an average age of 24 years. The most common signs/symptoms of EBV2 were fever (76.9%, 10/13), average duration of 18 days, and lymphadenopathy (69.2%, 9/13).

Methods: We evaluated the possibility of vector transmission of T. cruzi based on records of the occurrence of domiciled triatomines collected by the Secretariat of State for Public Health from 2005 to 2015. During this period. 67.7% (113/167) of municipalities conducted at least one active search and 110 recorded the presence of insects in DUs. These activities were more frequent in municipalities considered to have a high and medium-level risk of T. cruzi transmission. Results: Of 51,569 captured triatomines, the most common species were Triatoma brasiliensis (47.2%) and T. pseudomaculata (40.2%). Colonies of T. brasiliensis, T. pseudomaculata, T. petrocchiae, Panstrongylus lutzi, and Rhodnius nasutus were also recorded in the intradomicile and peridomicile. Natural infection by trypanosomatids was detected in 1,153 specimens; the highest rate was found in R. nasutus (3.5%), followed by T. brasiliensis (2.5%) and T. pseudomaculata (2.4%). There have been high levels of colonization over the years; however, not all infested DUs have been sprayed. Conclusions: This is the first report of intradomicile and peridomicile colonization by P. lutzi. These results demonstrate the risk of new cases of infection by T. cruzi and reinforce the need for continuous entomological surveillance in the State of Rio Grande do Norte."

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), caused by intracellular protozoa parasite of genus Leishmania, comprises a complex of clinical manifestations that affect the skin and mucous membranes. The available drugs for the treatment are toxic and costly, with long periods of treatment, and the emergence of resistant strains has been reported. In this study we investigated the in vitro effects of a phthalimide-1,2,3-triazole derivative, the 4-Phenyl-1-[2-(phthalimido-2-yl)ethyl]-1H-1,2,3-triazole (PT4) obtained by click chemistry, on mammalian cells and on L. amazonensis and L. braziliensis, the causative agents of CL in Brazil. In silico ADMET evaluation of PT4 showed that this molecule has good pharmacokinetic properties with no violation of Lipinski's rules. The in vitro assays showed that PT4 was more selective for both Leishmania species than to mammalian cells. This compound also presented low cytotoxicity to mammalian cells with CC50 > 500 mu M. Treatment of promastigote forms with different concentrations of PT4 resulted in ultrastructural alterations, such as plasma membrane wrinkling, shortening of cell body, increased cell volume and cell rupture. The molecular dynamic simulations showed that PT4 interacts with Lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase from Leishmania, an essential enzyme of lipid synthesis pathway in this parasite. Our results demonstrated PT4 was effective against both species of Leishmania. PT4 caused a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased production of reactive oxygen species, which may lead to parasite death. Taken together, our results pointed PT4 as promissing therapeutic agent against CL."

Drawing from contributions from epidemiology, social sciences, demography, psychology, psychiatry and economy, this scoping review provides an up-to-date and comprehensive synthesis of studies addressing the health status and determinants of this population. We describe major research gaps and suggest specific avenues of further inquiry. Methods: We identified systematically papers that addressed the concepts ""health"" and ""Hispano Americans"" indexed in five data bases from Jan 1990 to May 2014 with no language restrictions. We screened the 4,464 citations retrieved against exclusion criteria and classified 193 selected references in 12 thematic folders with the aid of the reference management software ENDNOTE X6. After reviewing the full text of all papers we extracted relevant data systematically into a table template to facilitate the synthesising process. Results: Most studies focused on a particular disease, leaving unexplored the interlinkages between different health conditions and how these relate to legislative, health services, environmental, occupational, and other health determinants. We elucidated some consistent results but there were many heterogeneous findings and several popular beliefs were not fully supported by empirical evidence. Few studies adopted a trans-national perspective and many consisted of cross-sectional descriptions that considered ""Hispano-Americans"" as a homogeneous category, limiting our analysis. Our results are also constrained by the availability and varying quality of studies reviewed. Conclusions: Burgeoning research has produced some consistent findings but there are huge gaps in knowledge. To prevent unhelpful generalisations we need a more holistic and nuanced understanding of how mobility, ethnicity, income, gender, legislative status, employment status, working conditions, neighbourhood characteristics and social status intersect with demographic variables and policy contexts to influence the health of the diverse Hispano-American populations present in Europe."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the metavirome in blood donors who tested positive for routinely tested blood-borne infections, the information for which is important for transfusion medicine and blood donor management. For this purpose, we analyzed 18 blood donations obtained from HIV and HBV-infected blood donors from the Brazilian Amazon (Amapa state) and 11 HIV, HBV, HCV, syphilis and Chagas disease positive blood donations obtained from blood donors sampled in South Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul state). We additionally included a control group of 20 blood donors obtained from Southeast Brazil (State of Sao Paulo). Samples were assembled in pools and sequenced by the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. To link a given virus with geographic region or type of blood donor, we performed supervised machine learning classification (fingerprint analysis). The virome of both locations was predominantly composed of commensal viruses. However, in HBV-infected blood donors from the Brazilian Amazon, the Human Pegivirus-1 (HPgV-1) reads were prevailing, while in HIV-infected donors from the same location, the torque teno virus (TTV) reads expressive abundance. In blood donors from South Brazil, the most abundant reads were classified as Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K). Putative emerging viruses like the Human gemykibivirus-2 (HuGkV-2) were exclusively identified in samples from the Brazilian Amazon. The fingerprint analysis demonstrated that the HERV-K, TTV-7, 13, and 15 were statistically important for the infected blood donors, while TTV-5, 12 and 20 were linked to geographic localization. Our study revealed differences in the viral composition among blood donors who tested positive for routinely tested blood-borne infections from two different Brazilian regions and indicated the presence of putative emerging viruses in samples obtained from the Amazon. Together our results show that the presence of specific commensal viruses may be related donor infection status but additional investigations including larger study groups and samples from other Brazilian regions are needed to confirm this hypothesis."

This project is developed at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Evandro Chagas in the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and promotes the continuing involvement of health researchers and professionals in the collaborative production of knowledge on health with patients and community groups and in their training as community health promoters. The new epidemic scenario created the demand for a space of dialogue and knowledge-sharing on the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Due to the interruption of regular activities in the Knowledge-Sharing Platform, a strategy was launched to serve as a link between science and society and help overcome the social isolation imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The WhatsApp group allowed project members to participate by addressing questions (audio) on COVID-19 through mediation by community group leaders. The main questions by participants related to risk factors, transmission, immunity to the novel coronavirus, care related to prevention, symptoms, and treatment; and COVID-19 and influenza vaccine. The educational material Caring in the Age of COVID-19 was produced and shared with community leaders and distributed to the respective groups and was eventually shared in their communities as a response to a demand for knowledge that responds to the concerns of people already exposed to structural vulnerability."

T. pseudomaculata is the second most epidemiologically important species in the northeast of Brazil after T. brasiliensis. Therefore, given the broad range of T. pseudomaculata, the objective of the present study was to cytogenetically analyze different populations of T. pseudomaculata from different Brazilian states in order to investigate possible intraspecific chromosomal variation between them. Three adult T. pseudomaculata males from each population (Pernambuco, Ceara, Paraiba, Bahia, Rio Grande do Norte, and Piaui) were analyzed by lacto-acetic orcein and C-banding. All of the specimens analyzed exhibited the same cytogenetic characteristics, i.e., 22 chromosomes (20 autosomes and XY), a chromocenter formed by the X and Y sex chromosomes and one pair of autosomes, and heterochromatin blocks in three or four pairs of autosomes. These data confirm that all of the populations analyzed were T. pseudomaculata, and although they may be subject to different selection pressures they have maintained the genetic integrity that characterizes the species."

Samples were sequenced at low-depth with whole-genome shotgun sequencing (Illumina technology). Using phylogenomics including 15 mitochondrial genes (13.3 kb), partial nuclear rDNA (5.2 kb) and 51 nuclear protein-coding genes (36.3 kb), we resolve sticking points in the Rhodnius phylogeny. At the species level, we confirmed the species-specific status of R. montenegrensis and R. marabaensis and we agree with the synonymy of R. taquarussuensis with R. neglectus. We also invite to revisit the species-specific status of R. milesi that is more likely R. nasutus. We proposed to define a robustus species complex that comprises the four close relative species: R. marabaensis, R. montenegrensis, R. prolixus and R. robustus. As Psammolestes tertius was included in the Rhodnius clade, we strongly recommend reclassifying this species as R. tertius. At the Rhodnius group level, molecular data consistently supports the clustering of the pictipes and pallescens groups, more related to each other than they are to the prolixus group. Moreover, comparing mitochondrial and nuclear tree topologies, our results demonstrated that various introgression events occurred in all the three Rhodnius groups, in laboratory strains but also in wild specimens. We demonstrated that introgressions occurred frequently in the prolixus group, involving the related species of the robustus complex but also the pairwise R. nasutus and R. neglectus. A genome wide analysis highlighted an introgression event in the pictipes group between R. stali and R. brethesi and suggested a complex gene flow between the three species of the pallescens group, R. colombiensis, R. pallescens and R. ecuadoriensis. The molecular data supports also a sylvatic distribution of R. prolixus in Brazil (Para state) and the monophyly of R. robustus. As we detected extensive introgression events and selective pressure on mitochondrial genes, we strongly recommend performing separate mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies and to take advantages of mito-nuclear conflicts in order to have a comprehensive evolutionary vision of this genus."

Up to 30% of the infected people may have cardiac alterations, which are associated with a worse prognosis and with high mortality rates. The occurrence of CD is associated with contexts of social vulnerability. However, no studies have been identified that assessed whether unfavorable social contexts are related to the prognosis and evolution of CD, which is the purpose of our study. We evaluated 1,637 patients with CD who lived in 21 municipalities located in regions to which CD is endemic in Brazil, over a two-year period. Of these people, 12.5% evolved into a worse prognosis. Our study revealed that socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals were not isolated protagonists of the evolution of CD. The context in which individuals lived was also a determining factor of a worse prognosis, including living in municipalities with a smaller rural population, fewer physicians, and a smaller Primary Health Care (PHC) coverage. Thus, we observed that characteristics related to the health care available in the municipalities influenced the evolution of CD. This knowledge has the potential to support health care planning that is more appropriate for the evolution of patients with CD, especially considering poor and remote regions. The present study aims to investigate how the social context contributes to the prognosis of Chagas disease (CD). This is a multilevel study that considered individual and contextual data. Individual data came from a Brazilian cohort study that followed 1,637 patients who lived in 21 municipalities to which CD is endemic, over two years. Contextual data were collected from official Brazilian government databases. The dependent variable wasthe occurrence of cardiovascular events in CDduring the two-year follow-up, defined from the grouping of three possible combined events: death, development of atrial fibrillation, or pacemaker implantation. Analysis was performed using multilevel binary logistic regression. Among the individuals evaluated, 205 (12.5%) manifested cardiovascular events in CD during two years of follow-up. Individuals living in municipalities with a larger rural population had protection for these events (OR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.4-0.7), while those residing in municipalities with fewer physicians per thousand inhabitants (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2-2.5) and those living in municipalities with lower Primary Health Care (PHC) coverage (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.1-2.1) had higher chances of experiencing cardiovascular events. Among the individual variables, the probability of experiencing cardiovascular events was higher for individuals aged over 60 years (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.01-2.2), with no stable relationship (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 0.98-2.1), without previous treatment with Benznidazole (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 0.98-2.9), with functional class limitation (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.4-2.9), with a QRS complex duration longer than 120 ms (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.3), and in individuals with high NT-proBNP levels (OR = 6.4; 95% CI = 4.3-9.6). CONCLUSION: The present study showed that the occurrence of cardiovascular events in individuals with CD is determined by individual conditions that express the severity of cardiovascular involvement. However, these individual characteristics are not isolated protagonists of this outcome, and the context in which individuals live, are also determining factors for a worse clinical prognosis."

Objective: We assessed the prevalence of HPV DNA in a series of ESCCs associated or not with CM. Data obtained were further correlated to the pathological and clinical data of affected individuals. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 92 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues collected from patients referred to 3 different hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil: Barretos Cancer Hospital, Barretos, Sao Paulo; Federal University of Triangulo Mineiro, Uberaba, Minas Gerais; and Sao Paulo State University, Botucatu, Sao Paulo. Cases were divided into 3 groups: (i) 24 patients with CM associated with ESCC (CM/ESCC); (ii) 37 patients with ESCC without CM (ESCC); and (iii) 31 patients with CM without ESCC (CM). Detection of HPV DNA was assessed in all samples by a genotyping assay combining multiplex polymerase chain reaction and bead-based Luminex technology. Results: We identified a high prevalence of high-risk HPV in patients in the CM group (12/31, 38.8%) and CM/ESCC (8/24, 33.3%), compared to individuals in the ESCC group (6/37, 16.3%). The individuals in the groups with cancer (ESCC and CM/ESCC) had a higher frequency of HPV-16 (4/9, 44.5% and 2/8, 25.0%). The other types of high-risk HPVs detected were HPV-31, 45, 51, 53, 56, 66, and 73. We also observed in some samples HPV coinfection by more than one viral type. Despite the high incidence of HPV, it did not show any association with the patient's clinical-pathological and molecular (TP53 mutation status) characteristics. Conclusion: This is the first report of the presence of HPV DNA in CM associated with ESCC. HPV infection was more presence in megaesophagus lesions. Further studies are needed to confirm and better understand the role of persistent HPV infection in patients with CM."

On January 7, 2020, the etiologic agent was identified; it was a new betacoronavirus, genetically similar to SARS-CoV-1, consisting of a simple RNA strand, an enveloped virus of 50-200nm in diameter, which was called SARS-CoV-2. Soon after, the disease was named COVID-19. On January 30, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Importance due to the spread of the coronavirus. Tests for serological detection of IgM and IgG antibodies are those that provide an estimate of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT), simple and accessible with a result within 5-30 minutes, based on sensitization of antigens/antibodies conjugated to colloidal gold capturing specific proteins present in the infected serum, plasma or blood. Objective: This work aims to show the analysis carried out with RDT for COVID-19 diagnosis in compliance with the current legislation from 02.04 to 18.08.2020. Method: In March of 2020, 25 serum/plasma samples were donated, without any identification. These samples were the remaining samples of tests performed on individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by the RT-PCR technique from health services (National Institute of Infectious Diseases Evandro Chagas - INI and State Institute of the Brain Paulo Niemeyer - IEC) located in the metropolitan region of the state of Rio de Janeiro. The samples obtained in order to become a serological panel were stored at -20 degrees C until the moment of use. Simultaneously, a panel of samples with confirmed reactivity for IgM and IgG antibodies from COVID-19 was being made, throughout the pandemic and the samples used were evaluated against three Rapid Tests, of different antigenic compositions or different brands; two ELISA tests for IgM and IgG; two chemiluminescence tests and when applicable, a molecular test. In order to assess the specificity of the products sent, surplus donation plasma samples were selected, known to be negative for HIV, HTLV, hepatitis b and c, chagas and syphilis, collected between 2013 and 2014, in the southern regions of the country, period in which SARS-CoV-2 was nonexistent in the world. In addition to True Positive (VP) and True Negative (VN) samples, interfering serum or plasma samples with reactivity for HIV, HCV, HTLV, HBsAg, chagas disease, syphilis and dengue were also included in the evaluation. Results: Out of 178 TR lots, 74.1%, 132 lots were from China and 25.9%, 46 TR lots were from Brazil; Germany; South Korea; Canada; USA; Singapore; Ireland and Switzerland. The analytical result showed that 57.0%, 101 TR lots obtained a Satisfactory result and 43%, 77 lots had Unsatisfactory results, when compared to the Sensitivity and Specificity values declared by the manufacturer, in the Instructions for Use. Conclusions: The results obtained show the need for constant monitoring of TRs for COVID-19 with the primary purpose of guaranteeing the quality of products sold in the country, one of the National Health Surveillance System pillars of action."

The importance and awareness of CVBDs continuously increased during the last years. However, information on their occurrence is often limited in several parts of the world, which are often especially affected. Latin America (LATAM), a region with large biodiversity, is one of these regions, where information on CVBDs for pet owners, veterinarians, medical doctors and health workers is often obsolete, limited or non-existent. In the present review, a comprehensive literature search for CVBDs in companion animals (dogs and cats) was performed for several countries in Central America (Belize, Caribbean Islands, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico) as well as in South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana (British Guyana), Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, Venezuela) regarding the occurrence of the following parasitic and bacterial diseases: babesiosis, heartworm disease, subcutaneous dirofilariosis, hepatozoonosis, leishmaniosis, trypanosomosis, anaplasmosis, bartonellosis, borreliosis, ehrlichiosis, mycoplasmosis and rickettsiosis. An overview on the specific diseases, followed by a short summary on their occurrence per country is given. Additionally, a tabular listing on positive or non-reported occurrence is presented. None of the countries is completely free from CVBDs. The data presented in the review confirm a wide distribution of the CVBDs in focus in LATAM. This wide occurrence and the fact that most of the CVBDs can have a quite severe clinical outcome and their diagnostic as well as therapeutic options in the region are often difficult to access and to afford, demands a strong call for the prevention of pathogen transmission by the use of ectoparasiticidal and anti-feeding products as well as by performing behavioural changes."

The aim of this review was to estimate the burden of heart failure in Latin America. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis following a search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and CENTRAL for articles published between January 1994 and June 2014, with no language restrictions. We included experimental and observational studies with at least 50 participants aged >= 18 years. Results: In total, 143 of the 4792 references retrieved were included in the study. Most studies had been conducted in South America (92%), and mainly in Brazil (64%). The mean age of the patients was 60 +/- 9 years, and mean ejection fraction was 36% +/- 9%. The incidence of heart failure in the single population study providing this information was 199 cases per 100 000 person-years. The prevalence of heart failure was 1% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.1%-2.7%); hospital readmission rates were 33%, 28%, 31%, and 35% at 3, 6, 12, and 24 to 60 months of follow-up, respectively; and the median duration of hospitalization was 7.0 days. The 1-year mortality rate was 24.5% (95% CI, 19.4%-30.0%). In-hospital mortality was 11.7% (95% CI, 10.4%-13.0%), and the rate was higher in patients with a reduced ejection fraction, ischemic heart disease, or Chagas disease. Conclusions: Few studies have evaluated the incidence and prevalence of heart failure in Latin America. High mortality and hospitalization rates were found, and the main limitation was heterogeneity between studies. The results presented provide useful epidemiologic information for decision-making related to this disease. Further studies with standardized methods and representative populations are needed in this line. (C) 2016 Sociedad Espanola de Cardiologia. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Conditions associated with the aging process have been diagnosed more frequently among HIV-infected patients, particularly, cardiovascular diseases. Methods Patients followed in the Instituto de Pesquisa Clinica Evandro Chagas (IPEC) prospective cohort in Rio de Janeiro were submitted to the general procedures from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health, comprising several anthropometric, laboratory and imaging data. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was measured by ultrasonography, following the Mannheim protocol. Linear regression and proportional odds models were used to compare groups and covariables in respect to cIMT. The best model was chosen with the adaptive lasso procedure. Results A valid cIMT exam was available for 591 patients. Median cIMT was significantly larger for men than women (0.56mm vs. 0.53mm; p = 0.002; overall = 0.54mm). In univariable linear regression analysis, both traditional risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and HIV-specific characteristics were significantly associated with cIMT values, but the best multivariable model chosen included only traditional characteristics. Hypertension presented the strongest association with higher cIMT terciles (OR = 2.51; 95% CI = 1.69-3.73), followed by current smoking (OR = 1,82; 95% CI = 1.19-2.79), family history of acute myocardial infarction or stroke (OR = 1.60; 95% CI = 1.10-2.32) and age (OR per year = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.10-1.14). Conclusions Our results show that traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are the major players in determining increased cIMT among HIV infected patients in Brazil. This finding reinforces the need for thorough assessment of those risk factors in these patients to guarantee the incidence of CVD events remain under control."

The use of techniques for amplification of the parasites DNA based on polymerase chain reaction polymerase chain reaction and the recent application of combined techniques, such as high-resolution DNA dissociation, have been described as a viable alternative for the detection and identification of Leishmania spp. in biological samples. Objectives: To identify the Leishmania species using the polymerase chain reaction high-resolution DNA dissociation technique in skin biopsies of hospital-treated patients, and compare with results obtained by other molecular identification techniques. Methods: A retrospective study assessing patients with suspected American cutaneous leishmaniasis seen at a hospital in Sao Paulo/Brazil was conducted. The paraffin blocks of 22 patients were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction high-resolution DNA dissociation to confirm the diagnosis and identify the species. Results: Of the 22 patients with suspected American cutaneous leishmaniasis, the parasite was identified in 14, comprising five cases (35.6%) of infection by L. amazonensis, four (28.5%) by L. braziliensis, two (14.4%) by L. amazonensis + L. infantum chagasi, two (14.4%) by L. guyanensis, and one (7.1%) by Leishmania infantum chagasi. In one of the samples, in which the presence of amastigotes was confirmed on histopathological examination, the polymerase chain reaction high-resolution DNA dissociation technique failed to detect the DNA of the parasite.

Long waiting lines and lack of a prioritisation system lead to diagnostic lag and may contribute to poor outcomes. We developed a prioritisation tool for use in primary care, aimed at improving resource utilisation, by predicting those at highest risk of having an abnormal echo, and thus in highest need of referral. Methods All patients in the existing primary care waiting list for echo were invited for participation and underwent a clinical questionnaire, simplified 7-view echo screening by non-physicians with handheld devices, and standard echo by experts. Two derivation models were developed, one including only clinical variables and a second including clinical variables and findings of major heart disease (HD) on echo screening (cut point for high/low-risk). For validation, patients were risk-classified according to the clinical score. High-risk patients and a sample of low-risk underwent standard echo. Intermediate-risk patients first had screening echo, with a standard echo if HD was suspected. Discrimination and calibration of the two models were assessed to predict HD in standard echo. Results In derivation (N = 603), clinical variables associated with HD were female gender, body mass index, Chagas disease, prior cardiac surgery, coronary disease, valve disease, hypertension and heart failure, and this model was well calibrated with C-statistic = 0.781. Performance was improved with the addition of echo screening, with C-statistic = 0.871 after cross-validation. For validation (N = 1526), 227 (14.9%) patients were classified as low risk, 1082 (70.9%) as intermediate risk and 217 (14.2%) as high risk by the clinical model. The final model with two categories had high sensitivity (99%) and negative predictive value (97%) for HD in standard echo. Model performance was good with C-statistic = 0.720. Conclusion The addition of screening echo to clinical variables significantly improves the performance of a score to predict major HD."

Skull CT showed silent cerebral ischemic events in 16.4% of the patients, 63.6% of whom had AHREs >= 6 min in the analysis of IECDs. Advanced age [OR 1.12 (95% CI 1.03-1.21; p=0.009] and the presence of AHREs >= 6 minutes [OR 96.2 (95% CI 9.4-987.4; p<0.001)] were independent predictors for ischemic events. Conclusion: AHREs detected by IECDs were associated with the presence of silent cerebral ischemic events in Chagasic patients."

The most popular version of the spatial scan statistic uses a circular-shaped scanning window. Several other variants, using other parametric or non-parametric shapes, are also available. However, none of them offer information about the uncertainty on the borders of the detected clusters. Method: We propose a new method to evaluate uncertainty on the boundaries of spatial clusters identified through the spatial scan statistic for Poisson data. For each spatial data location i, a function F(i) is calculated. While not a probability, this function takes values in the [0, 1] interval, with a higher value indicating more evidence that the location belongs to the true cluster. Results: Through a set of simulation studies, we show that the F function provides a way to define, measure and visualize the certainty or uncertainty of each specific location belonging to the true cluster. The method can be applied whether there are one or multiple detected clusters on the map. We illustrate the new method on a data set concerning Chagas disease in Minas Gerais, Brazil. Conclusions: The higher the intensity given to an area, the higher the plausibility of that particular area to belong to the true cluster in case it exists. This way, the F function provides information from which the public health practitioner can perform a border analysis of the detected spatial scan statistic clusters. We have implemented and illustrated the border analysis F function in the context of the circular spatial scan statistic for spatially aggregated Poisson data. The definition is clearly independent of both the shape of the scanning window and the probability model under which the data is generated. To make the new method widely available to users, it has been implemented in the freely available SaTScan (TM) software www.satscan.org."

We collected samples from 60 individuals, namely: group I composed of 30 healthy individuals; and group II composed of 30 individuals eliminating S. stercoralis larvae in feces. We calculated the area under the curve, general index of diagnostic accuracy, Kappa index and determined the correlations between different diagnostic tests. The detection of IgG levels was performed by an immunoenzymatic assay with alkaline extract of S. venezuelensis larvae as antigen. Positivity of anti-S. stercoralis IgG in serum samples from group I was 3.3%, and from group II 93.3%. The detection of immune complex indicated that group I exhibited 3.3% and group II 56.7%. In the saliva samples, IgG detection was 26.7% for group I and 43.3% for group II. Immune complex was detected in 20% of group I, and 30% of group II.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are described as a heterogeneous population of myeloid origin, immature state, with a strong capacity to suppress T cells and other immune populations. Although the initial characterization of these cells was strongly associated with pathological conditions such as cancer and then with chronic and acute infections, extensive evidence supports that MDSCs are also involved in physiological/non-pathological settings, including pregnancy, neonatal period, aging, and vaccination. Vaccination is one of the greatest public health achievements and has reduced mortality and morbidity caused by many pathogens. The primary goal of prophylactic vaccination is to induce protection against a potential pathogen by mimicking, at least in a part, the events that take place during its natural interaction with the host. This strategy allows the immune system to prepare humoral and cellular effector components to cope with the real infection. This approach has been successful in developing vaccines against many pathogens. However, when the infectious agents can evade and subvert the host immune system, inducing cells with regulatory/suppressive capacity, the development of vaccines may not be straightforward. Notably, there is a long list of complex pathogens that can expand MDSCs, for which a vaccine is still not available. Moreover, vaccination against numerous bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi has also been shown to cause MDSC expansion. Increases are not due to a particular adjuvant or immunization route; indeed, numerous adjuvants and immunization routes have been reported to cause an accumulation of this immunosuppressive population. Most of the reports describe that, according to their suppressive nature, MDSCs may limit vaccine efficacy. Taking into account the accumulated evidence supporting the involvement of MDSCs in vaccination, this review aims to compile the studies that highlight the role of MDSCs during the assessment of vaccines against pathogens."

Trichomoniasis is a prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted disease, and a significant amount of new cases are identified each year globally. Furthermore, the infection is linked with serious concerns such as pregnancy outcomes, infertility, predisposition to cervical and prostate cancer, and increased transmission and acquisition of HIV. The therapy is restricted, adverse effects are often observed, and resistance to the drugs is emerging. Based on this, a new treatment for trichomoniasis is necessary. Natural products represent a rich source of bioactive compounds, and even today, they are used in the search for new drugs. Additionally, natural products provide a wide variety of leadership structures that can be used by the pharmaceutical industry as a template in the development of new drugs that are more effective and have fewer or no undesirable side effects compared to current treatments. This review focuses on the medicinal plants that possess anti-trichomonal activity in vitro or in vivo. An electronic database search was carried out covering the last three decades, i.e., 1990-2020. The literature search revealed that almost a dozen isolated phytoconstituents are being explored globally for their anti-trichomonal activity. Simultaneously, many countries have their own traditional or folk medicine for trichomoniasis that utilizes their native plants, as a whole, or even extracts. This review focuses mainly on the human parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. However, at some points mention is also made to Tritrichomonas foetus that causes trichomoniasis in animals of high veterinary and economical interest. We will focus on the plants and plant-based compounds and their anti-trichomonal activity. The literature search highlighted that there are abundant compounds that possess anti-trichomonal activity; however, in-depth in-vivo evaluation of compounds and their clinical evaluation has not been undertaken. There is a critical need for new anti-trichomonal compounds, and focused research on phytoconstituents can provide the way forward."

It is believed that antigens released via secretion, excretion and metabolism are more specific than are antigens released by the lysis of Leishmania parasites. Such antigens are known as exo-antigens (exo-Ag) and are formed from products released by cultured parasites in a way that is similar to that in which they cause infections in hosts. Objective: We attempted to validate a Leishmania mexicana ELISA exo-Ag for ATL diagnosis in Midwestern Brazil. Methods: A total of 281 patients were included in the study. We analysed pre-treatment blood from 98 ATL patients; out of those, 85.7% and 14.3% had cutaneous and mucosal forms, respectively. Results: The exo-Ag accuracy was 83.99% (95% CI. = 79.24-87.81) with a sensitivity value of 90.82% (95% CI. = 83.46-95.09) and an overall specificity value of 80.33% (95% CI. = 73.97-85.44).

The epidemiology of AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs) and non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) in HIV-infected populations in Brazil has not been well described. It is not known if cancer trends in HIV-infected populations in Brazil are similar to those of other countries where antiretroviral therapy is also widely available. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical cohorts at Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas (INI) in Rio de Janeiro and Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic (VCCC) in Nashville from 1998 to 2010. We used Poisson regression and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) to examine incidence trends. Clinical and demographic predictors of ADCs and NADCs were examined using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: This study included 2,925 patients at INI and 3,927 patients at VCCC. There were 57 ADCs at INI (65% Kaposi sarcoma), 47 at VCCC (40% Kaposi sarcoma), 45 NADCs at INI, and 82 at VCCC. From 1998 to 2004, incidence of ADCs remained statistically unchanged at both sites. From 2005 to 2010, ADC incidence decreased in both cohorts (INI incidence rate ratio per year = 0.74, p < 0.01; VCCC = 0.75, p < 0.01). Overall Kaposi sarcoma incidence was greater at INI than VCCC (3.0 vs. 1.2 cases per 1,000 person-years, p < 0.01). Incidence of NADCs remained constant throughout the study period (overall INI incidence 3.6 per 1,000 person-years and VCCC incidence 5.3 per 1,000 person-years).

We estimated the prevalence of hyperglycemia and compared the TB treatment outcomes and 1-year mortality rate according to the glycemic status noted during TB treatment. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of adult patients who had TB and HIV coinfection and started receiving TB treatment at the Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Brazil, between 2010-2015. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and hyperglycemia were defined according to the American Diabetes Association. After excluding for known DM at baseline, the proportion of participants who developed new-onset DM after TB treatment was assessed. TB outcome was classified as successful or adverse (i.e., treatment failure, abandonment, and death). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by the log-rank test based on the glycemic status of patients. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess the association between hyperglycemia and 1-year mortality. Two-sided p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: We identified 414 euglycemic patients (87.5%), 49 hyperglycemic patients (10.3%), and 10 patients with known DM (2.1%). Diabetic patients were older compared to the euglycemic and hyperglycemic patients (47.9 vs. 37 vs. 39.7 years, respectively, p = 0.001). Diabetic patients frequently had cavitation on chest image compared to hyperglycemic and euglycemic patients (50% vs. 23.4% vs. 15.3%, p = 0.007, respectively). Hyperglycemic patients had more new-onset DM at follow-up compared to euglycemic (22 vs. 1; p < 0001). Hyperglycemia was associated with adverse outcomes (71.4% vs. 24.6%, p < 0.0001) compared to euglycemia. Crude 1-year mortality was significantly higher in patients with hyperglycemia compared with euglycemia (48.9% vs. 7.9%; unadjusted HR: 5.79 (3.74-8.96)). In the adjusted Cox models, hyperglycemia remained a significant factor for increased 1-year mortality (adjusted HR: 3.72 (2.17-6.38)].

However, one species, Triatoma rubrofasciata, has been recorded in the Americas as well as in various port areas in Africa and Asia. An increasing number of T. rubrofasciata have been reported in southern China in recent years. However, the origin of this invasive insect vector in China remains unknown, therefore, accurate identification and phylogenetic analysis of the bugs are urgently needed. Methods A total of seven triatomine insect specimens were found and collected from Maoming City, Guangdong Province, China (GDMM) and Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, China (FJZZ), respectively. The obtained insect vector specimens were observed under a dissecting microscope for morphological classification and then the genomic DNA was extracted, and the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 28S rRNA as well as cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) genes of the species were amplified and sequenced. Subsequently, molecular phylogenetic analyses based on multiple alignments of the above genes were conducted in order to identify the species and determine the phylogenetic origin approximation accurately. Results The triatomine insects collected from GDMM and FJZZ were identified as Triatoma rubrofasciata using morphological and genetic analyses. All of the Chinese T. rubrofasciata captured in FJZZ, GDMM and other localities in southern China, together with a Vietnamese and Brazilian strain, formed a new, cohesive clade. T. rubrofasciata in GDMM and FJZZ are likely derived from strains found in Vietnam or Brazil. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of the invasive insect T. rubrofasciata, which is likely derived from strains native to Vietnam or Brazil, in both Maoming City, Guangdong Province and Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province of China. A comparison of the DNA sequences of the 16 s rRNA, 28 s rRNA and COI genes confirmed the specific identification of T. rubrofasciata, and its potential origin in China is based on the phylogenetic analyses undertaken in this study. More targeted interventions and improved entomological surveillance are urgently needed to control the spread of this haematophagous insect in China."

Mortality risk associated with a 5% weight/WC loss and gain was compared to that of weight/WC stability by Cox models adjusted for clinical, behavioral and social known risk factors for death (age, gender, BMI, smoking, diabetes, total cholesterol, hypertension, Chagas disease, major electrocardiographic changes, physical activity, B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, creatinine, education and household income). Results: Female sex was predominant (718; 63.1%). Mean age was 68 (6.7) years. Weight stability (696; 61.1%) was more common than weight loss (251; 22.1%) or gain (191; 16.8%).

WC change was not significantly associated with mortality. Conclusion: Although weight loss has been recommended for adults with excessive weight regardless of age, weight change might be detrimental in older adults. Rather than weight loss, clinical interventions should target healthy lifestyle behaviors that contribute to weight stability, particularly physical activity in overweight and obese older adults."

The canine leishmaniasis diagnosis is not easy based on clinical signs, since dogs may not develop the infection with recognizable signs. Thus, the laboratorial diagnosis is essential to ascertain the incidence and prevalence of canine leishmaniasis especially in areas with major control efforts. Although, the diagnosis can be performed by the use of different approaches, the molecular methods such as PCR have become an indispensable tool for leishmaniases diagnosis. A TaqMan assay for real-time PCR (Linj31-qPCR) was developed to determine the parasite occurrence in clinical cases of leishmaniasis. The assay targets an L. (L.) infantum hypothetical protein region. The specificity of the assay was verified by using Leishmania World Health Organization reference strains including parasites belonging to subgenus L. (Leishmania), subgenus L. (Viannia), other Leishmania species and Trypanosoma cruzi. The sensitivity was verified by using isolates of L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) infantum. The usefulness of the assay for diagnosis was ascertained by testing 277 samples from dogs in regions endemic for visceral and/or cutaneous leishmaniasis and from regions in which leishmaniasis was not endemic in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) was determined on these animals by conventional PCR and three serological tests. The dog samples were divided into four groups. I, dogs with CVL (n = 101); II, dogs with other diseases and without CVL (n = 97); III, dogs with American cutaneous leishmaniasis (n = 7), and, IV, dogs without CVL (n = 72) from areas where leishmaniasis was not endemic as control group. Results indicated that Linj31-qPCR was able to identify parasites belonging to subgenus L. (Leishmania) with no cross-amplification with other parasite subgenera. The Linj31-qPCR detected Leishmania parasites DNA in 98% of samples from Group I. In conclusion this methodology can be used as routine diagnostic tools to detect parasites from subgenus Leishmania.

Identification of congenital infection is often delayed; early recognition and management of congenital infections is important. Testing modalities and investigations are often limited, leading to missed diagnostic opportunities. Methods The SCORTCH (syphilis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), 'other', rubella, toxoplasmosis, chickenpox, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and blood-borne viruses) acronym increases the awareness of clinicians to the increased risk of congenital syphilis, while considering other infectious aetiologies including: zika, malaria, chagas disease, parvovirus, enterovirus, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and human T-lymphotropic virus 1, in addition to the classic congenital infections recognised in the 'TORCH screen' (toxoplasmosis, 'other', rubella, CMV, HSV). The SCORTCH diagnostic approach describes common signs present in infants with congenital infection, details serological testing for mother and infant and important direct diagnostics of the infant. Direct diagnostic investigations include: radiology, ophthalmology, audiology, microbiological and PCR testing for both the infant and placental tissue, the latter also warrants histopathology. Conclusion The traditional 'TORCH screen' focuses on serology-specific investigations, often omits important direct diagnostic testing of the infant, and fails to consider emerging and re-emerging congenital infections. In recognition of syphilis as a re-emerging pathogen and the overlapping clinical presentations of various infectious aetiologies, we advocate for a broader outlook using the SCORTCH diagnostic approach."

Rifabutin allows more regimens options for concomitant imunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment compared to rifampicin. OBJECTIVE Compare the outcomes of TB-HIV co-infected patients who used rifampicin or rifabutin. METHODS We analysed data from a prospective cohort study at National Institute of Infectious Diseases Evandro Chagas, Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Brazil. Patients who were treated for TB and HIV with rifampicin or rifabutin, from February 2011 to September 2016 were included. FINDINGS There were 130 TB-HIV patients, of whom 102 were treated with rifampicin and 28 with rifabutin. All patients in the rifabutin-treated group and 55% of the rifampicin-treated group patients were ART-experienced. Patients treated with rifampicin had similar abandon and cure rates, interruptions in treatment due to adverse reactions, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and a similar mortality rate as those treated with rifabutin. However, rifampicin-treated patients had higher CD4 counts and more frequently undetectable HIV viral load by the end of treatment (67% versus 18%, p < 0.001) compared to rifabutin-treated patients, even when only ART-experienced patients were evaluated (66,6% versus 36,3%, p = 0.039).

Despite the significant improvements, high rates of early mortality, usually defined as that occurring within the 1st year of entry to care, have been observed, especially in resource-limited settings. This analysis draws upon data from an observational cohort of people with HIV (PWH) followed at a reference center for HIV/AIDS care and research in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to identify the pattern and factors associated with early mortality. Methods The study population includes PWH aged 18 or older followed at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Evandro Chagas who were enrolled between 2004 and 2015. The primary outcome was early mortality, defined as deaths occurring within 1 year of inclusion in the cohort, considering two follow-up periods: 0 to 90 days (very early mortality) and 91 to 365 days (early mortality). Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify the variables associated with the hazard of very early and early mortality. Results Overall, 3879 participants contributed with 3616.4 person-years of follow-up. Of 220 deaths, 132 happened in the first 90 days and 88 between 91 and 365 days. Very early mortality rate ratios (MRR) show no statistically significant temporal differences between the periods 2004-2006 to 2013-2015. In contrast, for early mortality, a statistically significant decreasing trend was observed: mortality rates in the periods 2004-2006 (MR = 5.5; 95% CI 3.9-7.8) and 2007-2009 (MR = 3.9; 95% CI 2.7-5.7) were approximately four and three-fold higher when compared to 2013-2015 (MR = 1.4; 95% CI 0.7-2.7). Low CD4 count and prior AIDS-defining illness were strongly associated with higher hazard ratios of death, especially when considering very early mortality. Conclusions The present study shows an excess of mortality in the 1st year of follow-up with no changes in the mortality rates within 90 days among PWH from Rio de Janeiro. We note the significant impact of initiating treatment with immunosuppression, as evidenced by the increased risk of death among those with low CD4 cell count and with AIDS-defining illnesses."

Samples from two endemic VL regions in Brazil, diagnosed by direct examination (DG1) and by at least two or one standard serological test (DG2 and DG3, respectively), as well as patients with chronic Chagas' disease (CG1) and healthy controls (CG2) were used in this study. The flow cytometry results were expressed as levels of IgG reactivity, based on the percentage of positive fluorescent parasites (PPFP). Using a 1:4096 serum dilution, a ROC curve analysis of the serum titration on flow cytometry has indicated a PPFP of 2% as the cutoff point to segregate positive and negative results. In the present study, flow cytometry had the best performance for DG1 (sensitivity of 96%) while rK39 (imunocromagraphic rapid test) and DAT (Direct agglutination test) were also associated with high sensitivity and specificity. The substantial agreement and kappa indexes observed suggested similar performances between these two tests and flow cytometry. IFAT (Immunofluorescent antibody test) and ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) had lower performances and the lower values of agreement with flow cytometry. Together, these findings suggest that although adjustments are needed in order to reduce cross reactivity with other trypanosomatids, flow cytometry has the potential to be a safe serological alternative for the diagnosis of VL."

The persistence of these T. infestans populations in the country has two different origins of equal concern: operational failures or insecticide resistance. Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize the susceptibility profile of the residual Brazilian populations of T. infestans to deltamethrin. Methods: The susceptibility reference lineage was derived from Cipein/Argentina. The populations studied were manually collected using a dislodging agent in peridomiciles in the States of Bahia (Novo Horizonte) and of Rio Grande do Sul (Santa Rosa and Doutor Mauricio Cardoso). Serial dilutions of deltamethrin were prepared and applied at the dorsal abdomen of first instar nymphs. The control group received only pure acetone. Mortality was evaluated after 72h. Qualitative tests assessed the mortality of a diagnostic dose of 1xLD(99) (2.76ng a.i./nymph) determined for the susceptibility reference lineage. Results: The susceptibility profile characterization of the T. infestans populations revealed an RR50 ranging from 1.73 to 3.26. The mortality percentage in response to a diagnostic dose was 100%. The results obtained in the quantitative and qualitative assays corresponded for all populations. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the persistence of residual foci of T. infestans in Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul is not related to insecticide resistance but may be associated with operational failures. In Rio Grande do Sul, we must consider the possibility of continuous reinfestation by Argentinian individuals, which justifies active and efficient epidemiological surveillance."

Therapeutic options for PCM and other systemic mycoses are limited and time-consuming, and there are high rates of noncompliance, relapses, toxic side effects, and sequelae. Previous work has shown that the cyclopalladated 7a compound is effective in treating several kinds of cancer and parasitic Chagas disease without significant toxicity in animals. Here we show that cyclopalladated 7a inhibited the in vitro growth of Paracoccidioides lutzii Pb01 and P. brasiliensis isolates Pb18 (highly virulent), Pb2, Pb3, and Pb4 (less virulent) in a dose-response manner. Pb18 was the most resistant. Opportunistic Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans were also sensitive. BALB/c mice showed significantly lighter lung fungal burdens when treated twice a day for 20 days with a low cyclopalladated 7a dose of 30 μg/ml/day for 30 days after intratracheal infection with Pb18. Electron microscopy images suggested that apoptosis- and autophagy-like mechanisms are involved in the fungal killing mechanism of cyclopalladated 7a. Pb18 yeast cells incubated with the 7a compound showed remarkable chromatin condensation, DNA degradation, superoxide anion production, and increased metacaspase activity suggestive of apoptosis. Autophagy-related killing mechanisms were suggested by increased autophagic vacuole numbers and acidification, as indicated by an increase in LysoTracker and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining in cyclopalladated 7a-treated Pb18 yeast cells. Considering that cyclopalladated 7a is highly tolerated in vivo and affects yeast fungal growth through general apoptosisand autophagy-like mechanisms, it is a novel promising drug for the treatment of PCM and other mycoses.

Methods: The characteristics of donors and the serological results of the donated blood were compiled from databases. Only donations with a negative serology or a positive serology confirmed by second-sample testing were included in the study. Results: A total of 14,368 donations were included in the study, of which 118 (0.8%) had a confirmed positive serology.

Although a vast amount of research has been performed on the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, the underlying mechanisms of this multisystemic disease have remained to be fully elucidated. Data were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus database GSE40182 dataset. After data preprocessing, differentially expressed genes of placental cells cultured in vitro from preeclampsia and normal pregnancy were determined and subjected to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis to identify the associated pathways. Furthermore, functional principal component analysis (FPCA) was used to calculate the corresponding F-value of each gene. In order to further study the key signaling pathways of preeclampsia, an elastic-net regression model and the Mann-Whitney U (MWU) test were used to estimate the weight of the signaling pathways. Finally, a co-expression network was generated and hub genes were identified based on the topological features. A total of 134 pathways with a role in preeclampsia were identified. The gene expression data of placenta cells cultured in vitro for different durations were determined and F-values of genes were estimated using the FPCA model. The top 1,000 genes were identified as the differentially expressed genes and subjected to further analysis by elastic-net regression and MWU test. Two key signaling pathways were different between the preeclampsia and control groups, namely hsa05142 Chagas disease and hsa05204 Chemical carcinogenesis. Among the genes involved in these two key pathways, 13 hub genes were identified from the co-expression network. Clustering analysis demonstrated that depending on these hub genes, it was possible to divide the sample into four distinct groups based on different incubation time. The top 3 candidates were Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 13 (MAPK13). TLR2 and associated pathways are known to be closely associated with preeclampsia, indirectly demonstrating the applicability of the analytic process applied. However, the role of GSTO1 and MAPK13 in preeclampsia has remained poorly investigated, and elucidation thereof may be a worthwhile endeavor. The present study may provide a basis for exploring potential novel genes and pathways as therapeutic targets for preeclampsia."

VL is a serious and fatal disease caused by the parasites Leishmania infantum and Leishmania donovani. The gold standard confirmatory diagnostic test for VL is the demonstration of parasites or their DNA from aspirates from spleen, lymph node, and bone marrow or from blood buffy coats. Here we describe the production and use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the development of a sensitive and specific antigen detection capture ELISA for VL diagnosis. This test simultaneously detects six leishmania protein biomarkers that we have previously described (Li-isd1, Li-txn1, Li-ntf2, Ld-mao1, Ld-ppi1 and Ld-mad1). The initial clinical validation of this new mAb-based multiplexed capture ELISA showed a sensitivity of >= 93%. The test was negative with 35 urine samples from healthy control subjects as well as with 30 patients with confirmed non-VL tropical diseases (cutaneous leishmaniasis, n = 6; Chagas disease, n = 6; schistosomiasis, n = 6; and tuberculosis, n = 12). These results strongly support the possible utility of this mAb-based multiplexed capture ELISA as a promising diagnostic test for active VL as well as for monitoring the treatment efficacy of this disease. The test is ready for upscaling and validation for clinical use. Author summary Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar is a systemic parasitic disease that is endemic in 75 countries with more than 500 million people at risk of infection. VL is caused primarily by the parasites known as Leishmania infantum and Leishmania donovani. It is estimated that VL affects 50,000-90,000 people each year, with 90% of the cases occurring in India, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and Brazil. VL is a fatal disease if not treated. Laboratory diagnosis of this disease can be performed using several different approaches. However, there is still a need for a simple, non-expensive, sensitive and specific test that can be used not only for the accurate diagnosis of this serious disease but also to monitor the efficacy of its treatment. Here we describe a new test that can circumvent most of the drawbacks of existing approaches. This new test detects six leishmanial proteins or biomarkers that are eliminated in the urine of patients with VL. The test is a conventional ELISA assembled with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for each of the six different biomarkers and it is performed in urine samples of suspected patients. An initial clinical validation demonstrated that the test has a sensitivity of >= 93% and specificity of 100%.

This study evaluated 100 Sporothrix spp. strains obtained from 1999 to 2018 from the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Fiocruz, which were identified through a polymerase chain reaction using specific primers for species identification. Two-fold serial dilutions of stock solutions of amphotericin B, itraconazole, posaconazole, ketoconazole and terbinafine prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide were performed to obtain working concentrations of antifungal drugs ranging from 0.015 to 8.0 mg/L.

All strains were identified as S. brasiliensis and thirteen were classified as non-wild type, two of them against different drugs. Non-wild type strains were identified throughout the entire study period. Patients infected by non-wild type strains presented prolonged treatment times, needed increased antifungal doses than those described in the literature and one of them presented a permanent sequel.

VL has high morbidity and leads to death if not properly treated. In Brazil, Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum is the main causative agent of LV. Golden hamsters have proven to be a suitable model for VL. Despite the importance of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis disturbances in infectious disease, few studies have addressed this issue in VL. In this study, we showed that L. infantum-infected hamsters present augmented levels of plasmatic cortisol in association with increased spleen parasite burden. Indeed, a strong positive correlation was observed between cortisol and biochemical parameters (AST/ALT/ALP) related to liver damage, as well pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1 beta), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-beta), and the arginase enzyme that may favor the progression of infection. On the other side, cortisol was negatively correlated with leucocytes, except monocytes, and with IFN-gamma and iNOS, which are involved in parasite-killing macrophage function. These results shed light on an unexplored aspect of VL pathogenesis, which is the importance of cortisol production in the disease-associated immune dysfunction. BackgroundSeveral infectious diseases are associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis disorders by elevating circulating glucocorticoids (GCs), which are known to have an immunosuppressive potential. We conducted this study in golden hamsters, a suitable model human visceral leishmaniasis (VL), to investigate the relationship of Leishmania (L.) infantum infection on cortisol production and VL severity. MethodsL. infantum-infected (n = 42) and uninfected hamsters (n = 30) were followed-up at 30, 120, and 180 days post-infection (dpi). Plasma cortisol was analyzed by radioimmunoassay and cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and arginase by RT-qPCR. ResultsAll hamsters showed splenomegaly at 180 dpi. Increased parasite burden was associated with higher arginase expression and lower iNOS induction. Cortisol levels were elevated in infected animals in all-time points evaluated. Except for monocytes, all other leucocytes showed a strong negative correlation with cortisol, while transaminases were positively correlated. Immunological markers as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta, IL-10, and transforming growth-factor-beta (TGF-beta) were positively correlated to cortisol production, while interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) presented a negative correlation. A network analysis showed cortisol as an important knot linking clinical status and immunological parameters. ConclusionsThese results suggest that L. infantum increases the systemic levels of cortisol, which showed to be associated with hematological, biochemical, and immunological parameters associated to VL severity."

Each parasite has between 20 and 150 mitochondria and each mitochondria has one copy of each target gene, while 18S rRNA gene is repeated 4 to 8 times. The specificity of mPCR was assessed by testing Plasmodium from rodents and birds, parasites responsible for other endemic diseases in the country such as schistosomiasis, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis in addition to microorganisms that, like Plasmodium, can cause anemia (Bartonella henselae, Babesia vogeli, Rickettsia vini).

They are classified as Reflex Syndromes, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (nOH) and Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity Syndrome. Reflex (vasovagal) syndromes will not be discussed in this article. 1. Reflex (vasovagal) syndromes are mostly benign and usually occur in patients without an intrinsic autonomic nervous system (ANS) or heart disease. Therefore, they are usually studied separately. 2. Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) is the term most currently used to define dysautonomia with impairment of the sympathetic and/or parasympathetic cardiovascular autonomic nervous system. It can be idiopathic, such as multisystemic atrophy or pure autonomic failure, or secondary to systemic pathologies such as diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease, dementia syndromes, chronic renal failure, amyloidosis and it may also occur in the elderly. 3. The presence of Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) implies greater severity and worse prognosis in various clinical situations. 4. Detection of Orthostatic Hypotension (OH) is a late sign and means greater severity in the context of dysautonomia, defined as Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (nOH). It must be differentiated from hypotension due to hypovolemia or medications, called non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nnOH). 5. OH can result from benign causes, such as acute, chronic hypovolemia or use of various drugs. However, these drugs may only reveal subclinical pictures of Dysautonomia. All drugs of patients with dysautonomic conditions should be reevaluated. 6. Precise diagnosis of CAN and the investigation of the involvement of other organs or systems is extremely important in the clinical suspicion of pandysautonomia. 7. In diabetics, in addition to age and time of disease, other factors are associated with a higher incidence of CAN, such poor glycemic control, hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity. Among diabetic patients, 38-44% can develop Dysautonomia, with prognostic implications and higher cardiovascular mortality. In the initial stages of DM, autonomic dysfunction involves the parasympathetic system, then the sympathetic system and, later on, it presents as orthostatic hypotension. 8. Valsalva, Respiratory and Orthostatic tests (30:15) are the gold standard methods for the diagnosis of CAN. They can be associated with RR Variability tests in the time domain, and mainly in the frequency domain, to increase the sensitivity (protocol of the 7 tests). These tests can detect initial or subclinical abnormalities and assess severity and prognosis. 9. The Tilt Test should not be the test of choice for investigating CAN at an early stage, as it detects cases at more advanced stages. Tilt response with a dysautonomic pattern (gradual drop in blood pressure without increasing heart rate) may suggest CAN. 10. Treatment of patients at moderate to advanced stages of dysautonomia is quite complex and often refractory, requiring specialized and multidisciplinary evaluation. There is no cure for most types of Dysautonomia at a late stage. 11. NOH patients can progress with supine hypertension in more than 50% of the cases, representing a major therapeutic challenge. The immediate risk and consequences of OH should take precedence over the later risks of supine hypertension and values greater than 160/90 mmHg are tolerable. Sleeping with the head elevated (20-30 cm), not getting up at night, taking short-acting antihypertensive drugs for more severe cases, such as losartan, captopril, clonidine or nitrate patches, may be necessary and effective in some cases. 12. Preventive measures such as postural care; good hydration; higher salt intake; use of compression stockings and abdominal straps; portioned meals; supervised physical activity, mainly sitting, lying down or exercising in the water are important treatment steps. 13. Various drugs can be used for symptomatic nOH, especially fludrocortisone, midodrine and droxidopa, the latter not available in Brazil. The risk of exacerbation or triggering supine hypertension should be considered. 14. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome represents a form of Dysautonomia and has been renamed as a systemic disease of exercise intolerance, with new diagnostic criteria: 1 - Unexplained fatigue, leading to occupational disability for more than 6 months; 2 - Feeling ill after exercising; 3 - Non-restorative sleep; 4 - One of the following findings: cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. Several pathologies today have evolved with chronic fatigue, being called chronic diseases associated with chronic fatigue. 15. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), another form of presentation of dysautonomic syndromes, is characterized by sustained elevation of heart rate (HR) >= 30 bpm (>= 40 bpm if <20 years) or HR >= 120 bpm, in the first 10 minutes in an orthostatic position or during the tilt test, without classical orthostatic hypotension associated. A slight decrease in blood pressure may occur. Symptoms appear or get worse in an orthostatic position, with dizziness, weakness, pre-syncope, palpitations, and other systemic symptoms being common."

Human cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is endemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where is caused by Leishmania braziliensis. The adaptive immune response is accountable for the healing of CL and despite of key role of CD8(+) T cells in this immune response little is known about the CD8(+) T lymphocytes frequencies, apoptosis and antigen-responsive CD8(+) T lymphocytes of CL patients during antimonial therapy. Methods: Using flow cytometry, we examined total and effector CD8(+) T cells from CL patients before (PBT), during (PDT) and after (PAT) treatment for apoptosis and frequencies upon isolation and after in vitro L. braziliensis antigens (LbAg)-stimulation culture. Besides, a correlation study between immunological findings and lesion size was done. Results: PDT showed lower frequencies of total CD8(+) T lymphocytes and higher levels of apoptosis of these cells, which were also observed following LbAg-stimulation culture. Regarding effector CD8(+) T cells, high frequencies were observed in PDT, while lower frequencies were observed in PAT. Interestingly, PDT showed higher frequencies of apoptotic-effector CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Similar results were seen after in vitro antigenic-stimulation assays. Correlation analysis showed that the greater the size of lesion, the smaller the frequency of effector CD8(+) T lymphocytes in PDT and PAT, as well as a positive correlation between apoptotic-effector CD8(+) T cells frequency and lesion size of PDT. Conclusions: Changes in effector CD8(+) T-lymphocyte frequencies, during and after treatment, seem to represent a critical stage to generate an efficient immune response and suggest that these cells would be evolved in the triggering or in the resolution of lesion, under the influence of therapy. This hypothesis opens new perspectives to clarify controversial statements about the protective or deleterious role of CD8(+) T cells in the cure or aggravation of CL and the new approach of evaluating patients during treatment proved to be of utmost importance for understanding the immune response in the healing process of human CL."

Coinfections in cats with sporotrichosis from this region, their risk factors and how they affect the treatment outcome in these animals are little known. The objectives of this study were to determine the coinfections of Sporothrix spp. with Toxoplasma gondii, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) and to correlate these infections with risk factors and the outcome of sporotrichosis treatment in cats from an endemic area of sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Materials, Methods & Results: It was conducted a cohort study involving 213 cats with definitive diagnosis of sporotrichosis from the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro and assisted in the Laboratory of Clinical Research on Dermatozoonosis in Domestic Animals (LAPCLIN-DERMZOO)/Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INI)/Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), in Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil, from November 2007 until February 2011. These animals were monthly evaluated due to sporotrichosis treatment until their sporotrichosis treatment outcomes. In every clinical evaluation, 5 mL of blood were collected in order to obtain the serum, which was stored at -20 degrees C. Information from the animal's medical records have also been collected, such as sex, eating habits, living with other cats, access to the streets, castration, age and the outcome of sporotrichosis treatment. Serological follow-up of anti-T. gondii antibodies were performed through indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) and indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) in all clinical evaluations. The FIV and FeLV antibody detection were made through a rapid immunoassay using the cats'serum samples from the first clinical evaluation. Fisher's exact test was applied to verify associations between T. gondii, FIV and FeLV coinfections, the outcome of sporotrichosis treatment and risk factors. To compare IHA and IFAT, the values of total, positive and negative concordances were evaluated. A P-value < 0.05 indicated significant associations in the statistical tests. Of the 213 cats, fourteen (6.6%) showed antibodies anti-T. gondii, twelve (5.6%) anti-FIV and thirty-five (16.4%) anti-FeLV. There was a concordance of 100% between IFAT and IHA for the serological diagnosis of T. gondii infection. No statistical difference was observed between the presence of anti-T gondii antibodies with the FIV and FeLV infections and with the outcome of sporotrichosis treatment (P > 0.05). Furthermore there was no significant statistical difference between the presence of anti-T gondii antibodies and the variables sex, eating habits, living with other cats, free access to the street, castration and age (P > 0.05). The follow-up of anti-T. gondii antibodies showed that in two cats there was a fourfold rise in the titers between two consecutive follow-ups and in one there was seroconversion, which were indicative of acute infection. Discussion: The occurrence of coinfections of sporotrichosis with T. gondii, FIV and FeLV was low in cats from the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where sporotrichosis is endemic. This was the first study that determine and follow-up the frequency of anti-T. gondii antibodies in a group of cats diagnosed with sporotrichosis. The fact that cats were domiciled with adequate feeding and management, the low frequency of T. gondii and the rare cases indicative of acute infection in the study population indicate that these animals are not highly exposed to infection by this protozoan."

The utility of CUE-use in settings that have implemented NAT should be evaluated over time. STUDY DESIGN, METHODS: Cross-sectional retrospective study carried out from June 2010-November 2015, at Manaus Hemocenter (HEMOAM), Amazonas, Brazil that implemented HIV-NAT in 2012. The HIV, HCV, HBV, HTLV, Chagas disease, and syphilis rates were compared among CUE and non-CUE blood donors, before and after HIV-NAT implementation. RESULTS: Among 287,588 donations, 2,154 (0.75%) were associated with CUE, mainly voluntary donations (64.2%), by repeat donors (58.4%) from young (median age = 31 years), males (84.4%), unmarried (63.1%). CUE-users compared to non-CUE donors (n = 285,434) had higher seropositivity rates to HIV (OR = 6.09, 95% CI: 3.68-10.07, p < 0.001), HBV (anti-HBc OR = 1.81 95% CI: 1.24-2.64, p = 0.004; HBsAg OR = 5.68, 95% CI: 1.78-18.07, p = 0.017), and syphilis (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.05-3.04, p = 0.030). Most (97.2%) discarded blood units associated to CUE was seronegative for all pathogens. Most donations (73.4%) were tested by HIV-NAT and showed four window period donations, positive by HIV-NAT only among non-CUE donors. CONCLUSION: A high rate of transfusion transmissible infections/TTIs was observed at HEMOAM especially in CUE-users. CUE-use offered an additional layer of blood safety by its association with anti-HBc/HBsAg and syphilis that are not covered by NAT. For blood banks in highly endemic areas for HIV and TTI, as HEMOAM, the identification of at risk donors, and the orientation to be tested at proper sites remain a great challenge."

It has been used as an animal model for studying different scientific questions ranging from the restoration of degraded green areas to medical aspects of Chagas disease, leishmaniasis and resistance against snake venom. As a marsupial, D. albiventris can also contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the different stages of organogenesis. Opossum joeys are born after only 13 days, and the final stages of organogenesis occur when the neonates are inside the pouch, depending on lactation. As neither the genome of this opossum species nor its transcriptome has been completely sequenced, the use of D. albiventris as an animal model is limited. In this work, we sequenced the D. albiventris transcriptome by RNA-seq to obtain the first catalogue of differentially expressed (DE) genes and gene ontology (GO) annotations during the neonatal stages of marsupial development. Results The D. albiventris transcriptome was obtained from whole neonates harvested at birth (P0), at 5 days of age (P5) and at 10 days of age (P10). The de novo assembly of these transcripts generated 85,338 transcripts. Approximately 30% of these transcripts could be mapped against the amino acid sequences of M. domestica, the evolutionarily closest relative of D. albiventris to be sequenced thus far. Among the expressed transcripts, 2077 were found to be DE between P0 and P5, 13,780 between P0 and P10, and 1453 between P5 and P10. The enriched GO terms were mainly related to the immune system, blood tissue development and differentiation, vision, hearing, digestion, the CNS and limb development. Conclusions The elucidation of opossum transcriptomes provides an out-group for better understanding the distinct characteristics associated with the evolution of mammalian species. This study provides the first transcriptome sequences and catalogue of genes for a marsupial species at different neonatal stages, allowing the study of the mechanisms involved in organogenesis."

In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of DM among HIV-infected patients and its association with overall mortality. All HIV-infected patients 18 years or older who were followed in the Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas (INI) cohort from January 1991 to December 2011 were included. Time-updated covariables included DM status, calendar year, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and CD4 cell counts. Fixed demographic covariables included gender and age at entry. Poisson models were used to calculate mortality rate ratios (RR) with robust variances. Among the 4,871 patients included, 1,192 (24.4%) died (mortality rate=4.72/100 person-years [PY]; 95% confidence interval [CI]=4.46-5.00). Death rates were significantly higher among those presenting with DM compared with those who did not (6.16/100 vs. 4.61/100 PY, respectively. p=0.001). In the final model, DM was significantly associated with mortality (RR=1.74; 95% CI=1.57-1.94; p<0.001). When the analysis was restricted to those on cART or the period post-1996, the association between DM and mortality was even stronger (RR=2.17; 95% CI=1.91-2.46; p<0.001 and RR=1.95; 95% CI=1.75-2.18; p<0.001, respectively). Among the major groups of cause of deaths (CODs), the proportion of AIDS-related conditions in patients with DM was lower (74.27% vs. 58.93%, respectively; p<0.001); whereas in non-AIDS-related conditions, nonimmunodeficiency-related causes (22.44% vs. 34.82%, respectively; p=0.004) were more common in patients with DM. In conclusion, DM was associated with increased mortality rates even after controlling for HIV-related variables associated to this outcome.

The clinically relevant species are S. schenckii, S. globosa and S. brasiliensis. In Brazil, S. brasiliensis is the most prevalent etiological agent among humans and cats. In cats with sporotrichosis, skin lesions are mainly characterized by nodules and ulcers, usually located in the head, nasal region and limbs. The presence of respiratory signs concomitantly with cutaneous lesions is frequent, especially sneezing, and may be associated with lesions located in the nasal mucosa. Ketoconazole (KTZ), itraconazole (112), potassium iodide (KI), sodium iodide (NaI), terbinafine (TRB), fluconazole (FLZ) and amphotericin B (AMB) are the drugs currently available for treating feline sporotrichosis. ITZ remains the drug of choice. ITZ combined with KI has been successfully used in the treatment of naive cats (especially cases with lesions in the nasal region), cases of recurrence and refractory to ITZ. Clinical cure with NaI has been described in some cases, but its use has been limited by adverse reactions. The conventional formulation is the saturated solution and the recommended dose in the treatment of feline sporotrichosis is 10 mg/kg every 12 h. Cats are sensitive to iodide preparations and should be carefully monitored for clinical evidence of iodism, such as apathy, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, hypothermia, hyperthermia, cardiomyopathy, hyperexcitability, muscular spasms and ptyalism. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic response of Na! capsules in feline sporotrichosis. Materials, Methods & Results: An observational cohort study was conducted in cats with sporotrichosis at the Laboratory of Clinical Research in Dermatozoonoses in Domestic Animals (Lapclin-Dermzoo), Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INI)/Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Twenty-eight cats with sporotrichosis confirmed by isolation of Sporothrix spp. in culture, no previous systemic antifungal therapy, and weight above 3.0 kg, were included in the study. The treatment consisted of NaI oral capsules (5 mg/kg/once daily). In cats without clinical improvement after one month of treatment, the dose was increased (10 mg/kg/once daily). The cats were followed up monthly by clinical examination, complete blood count and biochemical analysis (urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase - ALT, aspartate aminotransferase - AST, alkaline phosphatase - FA). All procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee (CEUA/Fiocruz), number LW 56/13, and the informed consent term was obtained from all tutors. Clinical cure was achieved in six (21.4%) cases and treatment failure was observed in 13 (46.4%) animals. Seven (25%) cats were lost during follow up, and unknown causes of death occurred in two cases (7.1%). Ten animals (35.7%) presented clinical adverse reactions at some point during treatment. Hyporexia and weight loss were the most frequent ones. Three cats presented alteration in renal function. Discussion: Treatment of feline sporotrichosis in epizootic areas has been a challenge for veterinarians and tutors. Additionally, there are few studies evaluating treatment regimens for this mycosis in animals. In this study, NaI was compounded in capsules, because it is easier to administer when compared to the solution, as previously described for KI. Despite the low cost and the convenient administration of the capsule, NaI presented a low cure rate with the dose used. The study of new pharmaceutical forms and lower doses of low-cost drugs is necessary in a scenario of epizootic sporotrichosis, where investments for the development of new antifungal agents arc scarce."

Therefore, improvements are required. rLiNTPDase2 has been previously highlighted as a new recombinant antigen from L. infantum to the CVL diagnosis by ELISA assay (rLiNTPDase2-ELISA). In this study, we aimed to evaluate rLiNTPDase2-ELISA in a Phase II study with 651 dog sera samples, also comparing it with methodologies previously established and used in epidemiology surveillance in Brazil, an endemic country of CVL and VL. The rLiNTPDase2-ELISA using standard control sera showed high capability to distinguish between positive and negative sera, sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 88.5%.

Apart from parasite drug resistance, which receives the largest share of attention, several factors directly influence the response to antimalarial treatment such as incorrect doses, adverse drug events, lack of adherence to treatment, drug quality and drug-drug interactions. Pharmacotherapy follow-up can be used to monitor and improve the effectiveness of treatment, prevent drug-related problems and ensure patient safety. The aim of this study was to describe the results of the implementation of pharmacotherapy follow-up of patients with malaria seen at a reference centre for malaria diagnosis and treatment (CPD-Mal) located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, an area without malaria transmission. MethodsA descriptive study was conducted from January 2009 to September 2013 at the Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas (INI) of the FundacAo Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz). All malaria patients enrolled in the study were treated according to the Brazilian Malaria Therapy Guidelines. Data collected during pharmacotherapy follow-up were recorded in a standardized form. The variables included were age, gender, comorbidities, antimalarials and concomitant medications used, adverse drug reactions (ADR), clinical and parasitological cure times, and treatment outcomes classified as success, recurrence (recrudescence or relapse); and lost to follow-up. The ADR were classified by severity (DAIDS-NIH), organ system affected (WHO-ART) and likelihood to be caused by drugs (Naranjo scale). Results and discussionOne hundred thirteen cases of malaria were included. Patients were aged between 13 and 66years and the majority of them (75.2%) were male. Ninety-four ADR were observed, most classified as mild (85.1%), related to disorders of the gastrointestinal system (63.8%), such as nausea and vomiting, and assessed as possibly caused by the antimalarial drugs (91.5%). The majority of clinical (90.9%) and parasitological (87.1%) cure occurred less than 72hours after treatment initiation. Pharmacotherapy follow-up of malaria treatment by surveillance activities is therefore important regarding information about treatment outcomes as well as patient safety, resulting in better patient care and reducing the chance of relapses. The results underscore its use as a tool for monitoring adherence and drug resistance outside an endemic area. What is new and conclusionPharmacotherapy follow-up should be considered a useful malaria surveillance tool that can be developed by reference centres for comprehensive health care assistance and monitoring of therapeutic resistance."

Methods: This observational retrospective study was developed with the database of digital ECGs from Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil (TNMG). All ECGs performed from 2010 to 2017 in primary care patients over 16 years old were assessed. The electronic cohort was obtained by linking data from ECG exams (name, sex, date of birth, city of residence) and those from national mortality information system, using standard probabilistic linkage methods (FRIL: Fine-grained record linkage software, v.2.1.5, Atlanta, GA). Only the first ECG of each patient was considered. Clinical data were self-reported, and ECGs were interpreted manually by cardiologists and automatically by the Glasgow University Interpreter software.

Results: From a dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,558,421 primary care patients over 16 years old underwent a valid ECG recording during 2010 to 2017. We excluded 17,359 patients that didn't have a valid QRS measure from the Glasgow program and 11,091 patients from the control group that had QRS equal or above 120 ms and were not RBBB or LBBB. Therefore, 1,529,971 were included (median age 52 [Q1:38; Q3:65] years; 40.2% were male). In a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, the overall mortality rate was 3.34%. RBBB was more frequent (2.42%) than LBBB (1.32%). In multivariate analysis, adjusting for sex, age and comorbidities, both patients with RBBB (HR 1.32; CI 95% 1.27-1.37) and LBBB (HR 1.69; CI 95% 1.62-1.76) had higher risk of overall mortality.

To disentangle which and how syndemic conditions affect the quality of life (QoL) may be important to improve well-being of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). This study evaluates the association between syndemic conditions and QoL among PLWHA. We performed a secondary analysis using data obtained between 2014 and 2017 among PLWHA under care in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The outcomes were the six QoL domains (physical, psychological, level of independence, social relationships, environmental, and spirituality) measured through the World Health Organization Quality of Life in HIV infection scale, abbreviated version (WHOQOL-HIV-BREF). The independent variables were demographic and clinical characteristics, syndemic conditions (binge drinking, compulsive sexual behavior, polysubstance use, intimate partner violence, and depression), and syndemics (two or more syndemic conditions simultaneously). Bivariate analysis (t-test and ANOVA) and linear regressions were performed for each quality-of-life domain. The analytical sample comprised 1530 participants, mostly male at birth (64%) and with median age of 43 years. The syndemic conditions most frequently observed were binge drinking (56%), IPV (13%), and depression (9%). Both individual syndemic conditions and syndemics were associated with worse QoL. In the multivariate analysis, positive screening for depression was associated with worse QoL in all domains. Polysubstance users presented worse QoL at social and environmental domains. Intimate partner violence was associated with worse QoL at environment domain while binge drinking was associated with worse scores in the physical domain. The presence of syndemics increased the likelihood of worse scores in the psychological, social, and environment domains. Our study expands the understanding of QoL in PLWHA, as it considers a holistic/integral, multifactorial, and synergistic approach to the determinants of QoL. Seeking strategies that target syndemics may be important to improve patient-centered outcomes in health.

The ability wingless nymphs have to move (crawl) within peridomestic settings is a key component regarding the design and development of rational control strategies. Methods: We double-marked Triatoma sordida fourth-instar nymphs (N4) with a reliable fluorescent dye and a trace element. This new methodology allowed us to simultaneously evaluate (i) nymph dispersal and (ii) the effectiveness of copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), and cadmium (Cd) trace elements as potential new markers. In the mark-release-recapture (MRR) experiment, 390 T. sordida N4 were released in the peridomicile of a single rural household, 130 individuals at each of three release points, at distances of 2, 5, and 10 m from the chicken coop (CC) and 27, 32, and 35 m away from the horse corral (HC). All specimens were double marked (Cu/blue, Cr/orange, Cd/green). Recaptures occurred in two intervals: 1–3 days and 15–17 days after release. Results: Specimens were successfully recaptured at all distances up to 10 m. A total of 19, 23, and 10 specimens were able to disperse 2, 5, and 10 m, respectively, to reach the CC. No insects were recaptured at the HC. Of the three analyte/paint combinations tested, Cr/orange gave the most promising results; Cu/blue marker and Cd/green marker performed very poorly with only 4/19 and 0/10 analyte/paint ratios, respectively. Conclusions: Triatoma sordida N4 could cover a distance of 10 m in 17 days. This indicates that nymphs seem to have a reduced dispersal capability compared to adults. Ninety-one percent of the 22 recaptured orange-marked nymphs were still Cr positive after the 17-day period evaluated. This makes this analyte a good candidate for future investigations that will apply this marking method in MRR studies.

It is estimated that at least 14,000 people die every year of CD. Since vaccines are not available, chemotherapy remains of pivotal relevance. About 30% of the treated patients cannot complete the therapy because of severe adverse reactions. Thus, the search for novel drugs is required. Here we tested the benznidazole (BZ) combination with the repositioned drug disulfiram (DSF) and its derivative diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) upon Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro and in vivo. DETC-BZ combination was synergistic diminishing epimastigote proliferation and enhancing selective indexes up to over 10-fold. DETC was effective upon amastigotes of the BZ- partially resistant Y and the BZ-resistant Colombiana strains. The combination reduced proliferation even using low concentrations (e.g., 2.5 µM). Scanning electron microscopy revealed membrane discontinuities and cell body volume reduction. Transmission electron microscopy revealed remarkable enlargement of endoplasmic reticulum cisternae besides, dilated mitochondria with decreased electron density and disorganized kinetoplast DNA. At advanced stages, the cytoplasm vacuolation apparently impaired compartmentation. The fluorescent probe H2-DCFDA indicates the increased production of reactive oxygen species associated with enhanced lipid peroxidation in parasites incubated with DETC. The biochemical measurement indicates the downmodulation of thiol expression. DETC inhibited superoxide dismutase activity on parasites was more pronounced than in infected mice. In order to approach the DETC effects on intracellular infection, peritoneal macrophages were infected with Colombiana trypomastigotes. DETC addition diminished parasite numbers and the DETC-BZ combination was effective, despite the low concentrations used. In the murine infection, the combination significantly enhanced animal survival, decreasing parasitemia over BZ. Histopathology revealed that low doses of BZ-treated animals presented myocardial amastigote, not observed in combination-treated animals. The picrosirius collagen staining showed reduced myocardial fibrosis. Aminotransferase de aspartate, Aminotransferase de alanine, Creatine kinase, and urea plasma levels demonstrated that the combination was non-toxic. As DSF and DETC can reduce the toxicity of other drugs and resistance phenotypes, such a combination may be safe and effective.

A relevant aspect in the host–parasite relationship is the identification of the various genotypes of T. cruzi called discrete typing units (DTU) that circulate in mammals and vectors. In Chile, it has been described that the DTUs TcI, TcII, TcV, and TcVI circulate in infected humans, vectors, and wild animals. Identifying DTUs has acquired clinical importance, since it has been suggested that different genotypes could cause distinct pathologies, circulate in different geographical areas, and present different sensitivities to trypanocidal drugs. In this study, circulating T. cruzi DTUs in peripheral blood and Triatoma infestans dejections used in xenodiagnosis (XD) were amplified by qPCR in 14 Chilean patients with chronic ChD from highly endemic areas. More positive samples were detected by XD compared to peripheral blood samples, and 64.28% of the cases were simple infections and 35.72% mixed, with a statistically significant difference in the frequency of TcV DTU. This study would suggest that T. infestans from Chile is more competent to amplify one DTU over others, probably due to a process of co-evolution. © 2022 by the authors."

It is considered a neglected tropi- cal disease that affects 6 to 7 million people worldwide. The reactivation of Chagas disease occurs when the chronically infected hosts are not able to control T. cruzi infection, generat- ing recurrence of the acute phase. HIV is the main immunosuppressive infection that can lead to the reactivation of chronic Chagas disease in AIDS conditions. In co-infected patients, the reactivation of Chagas disease is related to their high parasite load, high HIV viral load, and CD4 T-cell counting less than 200/mm3, which may evolve to meningoen- cephalitis and myocarditis. Eight T. cruzi/HIV co-infected patients under antiretroviral ther- apy (ART) and ten Chagas disease patients without HIV infection that attended at Study Group of Chagas Disease, Hospital de Clınicas, University of Campinas (GEdoCh/HC/UNI- CAMP-SP) and Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas SP (PUCC/SP) were evaluated. Tests for Chagas disease were performed, such as qPCR and T. cruzi blood culture. The patient’s medical records were analyzed to verify clinical and epidemiological data, viral load, and CD4 T-cell counting since the outset of ART. For both groups, we found no stati- cally significant differences between parasite load via blood culture and qPCR. In T. cruzi/ HIV co-infected subjects, we observed a significant increase of CD4 T-cells counting and viral load decrease, which became undetectable over the years after ART. Parasites iso- lated from the patient’s blood culture were genotyped, being the majority of them infected with TcII and one case of mixed infection (TcII and TcV/TcVI). These results were expected according to the region of origin of the patients. We suggest that the parasite load be moni- tored through qPCR in T.cruzi/HIV co-infected patients. We conclude that ART in people liv- ing with HIV improves infection and immunosuppression control, enabling the natural evolution of the American trypanosomiasis. © 2022 Marcon et al."

A distinctive cytogenetic characteristic of this group is the presence of extremely stable chromosome numbers. Unexpectedly, the analyses of the chromosomal location of ribosomal gene clusters and other repetitive sequences place Triatominae as a significantly diverse hemipteran subfamily. Here, we advance the understanding of Triatominae chromosomal evolution through the analysis of the 45S rDNA cluster chromosomal location in 92 Triatominae species. We found the 45S rDNA clusters in one to four loci per haploid genome with different chromosomal patterns: On one or two autosomes, on one, two or three sex chromosomes, on the X chromosome plus one to three autosomes. The movement of 45S rDNA clusters is discussed in an evolutionary context. Our results illustrate that rDNA mobility has been relatively common in the past and in recent evolutionary history of the group. The high frequency of rDNA patterns involving autosomes and sex chromosomes among closely related species could affect genetic recombination and the viability of hybrid populations, which suggests that the mobility of rDNA clusters could be a driver of species diversification. © 2021 Royal Entomological Society."

Previous studies showed that patients with CL and ML have very high levels of Leishmania-specific anti-α-Gal antibodies. However, the native parasite α-Gal glycotope(s) is(are) still elusive, thus they have not yet been explored for a more accurate TL diagnosis. Using a chemiluminescent immunoassay, we evaluated the seroreactivity of TL patients across its clinical spectrum, and of endemic (EC) and nonendemic healthy controls (NEC) against three synthetic neoglycoproteins (NGP29b, NGP30b, and NGP28b), respectively comprising the L. major-derived type-2 glycoinositolphospholipid (GIPL)-1 (Galfβ1,3Manα), GIPL-2 (Galα1,3Galfβ1,3Manα), and GIPL-3 (Galα1,6Galα1,3Galfβ) glycotopes. Contrary to NGP29b and NGP30b, NGP28b exhibited high sensitivity and specificity to a CL serum pool. More importantly, NGP28b reacted strongly and specifically with individual sera from distinct clinical forms of TL, especially with SC sera, with 94% sensitivity and 97% specificity, by post-two-graph receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis. Contrary to NGP29b, NGP28b showed low cross-reactivity with Chagas disease and control (NEC/EC) sera. Additionally, seroreactivity of CL patients against NGP28b was significantly decreased after successful chemotherapy, indicating that L. braziliensis-specific anti-α-Gal antibodies may serve as an early biomarker of cure in CL.

While initially limited to the Americas, emigration of infected persons triggered geographically broader blood safety challenges. To mitigate transfusion-transmitted Chagas (TTC), transfusion services implemented approaches including risk factor questions and serologic testing. We sought to understand and compare strategies in non-endemic countries. Materials and Methods: Transfusion services in International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT)-affiliated organizations and members of the ISBT Working Party on Transfusion-Transmitted Infectious Diseases were invited to complete an online survey on T. cruzi mitigation strategies. The survey queried about cases of TTC, risk factors, testing methodology, educational materials, pathogen reduction, donor/product management, donor deferral and perceived public health concerns surrounding TTC. Results: Responses were received from 27 institutions in 22 countries. Most countries (77.3%) reported no historical TTC cases, while 18.2% reported 1–5 cases and 4.5% reported 6–10 cases. Concern about Chagas among the general public and public health authorities was low, but 12 of 25 blood centres reported moderate/high concern. Overall, 17 countries mitigated for TTC: 15 used risk factor questions and 10tested for T. cruzi antibodies. Ten countries used pathogen reduction but not specifically to prevent TTC. Conclusion: While Chagas is rarely cited as a public health concern, blood centres in many non-endemic countries, including those outside the Americas, implemented measures to mitigate risk. Mitigation focussed on risk factors associated with Latin American immigrants and serologic testing. Thus, despite the rarity of TTC, many non-endemic countries continue to address it as an ongoing blood safety risk. © 2021 International Society of Blood Transfusion."

Longitudinal studies published between 1 January 1946 and 24 October 2018 were included. A random-effects meta-analysis using the death rate over the mean follow-up period in years was used to obtain pooled estimated annual mortality rates. Main outcomes were defined as all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular, non-cardiovascular, heart failure, stroke, and sudden cardiac deaths. A total of 5005 studies were screened for eligibility. A total of 52 longitudinal studies for chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy including 9569 patients and 2250 deaths were selected. The meta-analysis revealed an annual all-cause mortality rate of 7.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.3–10.1; I2 = 97.74%; T2 = 0.70] among patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. The pooled estimated annual cardiovascular death rate was 6.3% (95% CI: 4.9–8.0; I2 = 96.32%; T2 = 0.52). The annual mortality rates for heart failure, sudden death, and stroke were 3.5%, 2.6%, and 0.4%, respectively. Meta-regression showed that low left ventricular ejection fraction (coefficient = −0.04; 95% CI: −0.07, −0.02; P = 0.001) was associated with an increased mortality risk.

Benznidazole (BZ), a drug available for its treatment, has limited efficacy and significant side effects. Essential oils (EOs) have demonstrated trypanocidal activity and may constitute a therapeutic alternative. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of the EOs of clove (CEO - Syzygium aromaticum) and ginger (GEO - Zingiber officinale), administered alone and in combination with BZ, in Swiss mice infected with T. cruzi. Methods: The animals were inoculated with 10,000 blood trypomastigotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi II by gavage and divided into four groups (n = 12 to 15): 1) untreated control (NT); 2) treated with BZ; 3) treated with CEO or GEO; and 4) treated with BZ + CEO or GEO. The treatments consisted of oral administration of 100 mg/kg/day, from the 5th day after parasite inoculation, for 20 consecutive days. All groups were submitted to fresh blood examination (FBE), blood culture (BC), conventional PCR (cPCR) and real-time PCR (qPCR), before and after immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide. Results: Clove and ginger EOs, administered alone and in combination with BZ, promoted suppression of parasitemia (p < 0.0001), except for the animals treated with CEO alone, which presented a parasitemia curve similar to NT animals. However, there was a decrease in the BC positivity rate (p < 0.05) and parasite load (< 0.0001) in this group. Treatment with GEO alone, on the other hand, besides promoting a decrease in the BC positivity rate (p < 0.05) and parasite load (p < 0.01), this EO also resulted in a decrease in mortality rate (p < 0.05) of treated mice. Conclusions: Decreased parasite load, as detected by qPCR, was observed in all treatment groups (BZ, CEO, GEO and BZ + EOs), demonstrating benefits even in the absence of parasitological cure, thus opening perspectives for further studies. © 2021, The Author(s)."

The share of genotypic, phenotypic, and biological similarities with the virulent, human-infective T. cruzi and T. brucei, allows comparative studies on mechanisms of pathogenesis. In this study, investigation of the T. rangeli Arginine Kinase (TrAK) revealed two highly similar copies of the AK gene in this taxon, and a distinct expression profile and activity between replicative and infective forms. Although TrAK expression seems stable during epimastigotes growth, the enzymatic activity increases during the exponential growth phase and decreases from the stationary phase onwards. No differences were observed in activity or expression levels of TrAK during in vitro differentiation from epimastigotes to infective forms, and no detectable AK expression was observed for blood trypomastigotes. Overexpression of TrAK by T. rangeli showed no effects on the in vitro growth pattern, differentiation to infective forms, or infectivity to mice and triatomines. Although differences in TrAK expression and activity were observed among T. rangeli strains from distinct genetic lineages, our results indicate an up-regulation during parasite replication and putative post-translational myristoylation of this enzyme. We conclude that up-regulation of TrAK activity in epimastigotes appears to improve proliferation fitness, while reduced TrAK expression in blood trypomastigotes may be related to short-term and subpatent parasitemia in mammalian hosts. © 2021 Elsevier Inc."

When macrophages were submitted to T. cruzi infection and treated with 2c and 3a, compounds reduced the release of trypomastigote forms. Results also showed that the increased trypanocidal activity induced by 2c and 3a is independent of nitric oxide release. Flow cytometry assay showed that compound 2e was able to induce necrosis and apoptosis in trypomastigotes. Parasites treated with the compounds 2e, 3a, and 3c presented flagellum shortening, retraction and curvature of the parasite body, and extravasation of the internal content.

Clinical manifestations vary from mild, localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) to aggressive mucosal disease. The host immune response strongly determines the outcome of infection and pattern of disease. However, the pathogenesis of ATL is not well understood, and host microRNAs (miRNAs) may have a role in this context. In the present study, miRNAs were quantified using qPCR arrays in human monocytic THP-1 cells infected in vitro with L. (V.) braziliensis promastigotes and in plasma from patients with ATL, focusing on inflammatory response-specific miRNAs. Patients with active or self-healed cutaneous leishmaniasis patients, with confirmed parasitological or immunological diagnosis, were compared with healthy controls. Computational target prediction of significantly-altered miRNAs from in vitro L. (V.) braziliensis-infected THP-1 cells revealed predicted targets involved in diverse pathways, including chemokine signaling, inflammatory, cellular proliferation, and tissue repair processes. In plasma, we observed distinct miRNA expression in patients with self-healed and active lesions compared with healthy controls. Some miRNAs dysregulated during THP-1 in vitro infection were also found in plasma from self-healed patients, including miR-548d-3p, which was upregulated in infected THP-1 cells and in plasma from self-healed patients. As miR-548d-3p was predicted to target the chemokine pathway and inflammation is a central to the pathogenesis of ATL, we evaluated the effect of transient transfection of a miR-548d-3p inhibitor on L. (V.) braziliensis infected-THP-1 cells. Inhibition of miR-548d-3p reduced parasite growth early after infection and increased production of MCP1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, and IP10/CXCL10. In plasma of self-healed patients, MCP1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, and IL-8/CXCL8 concentrations were significantly decreased and MIG/CXCL9 and IP-10/CXCL10 increased compared to patients with active disease. These data suggest that by modulating miRNAs, L. (V.) braziliensis may interfere with chemokine production and hence the inflammatory processes underpinning lesion resolution. Our data suggest miR-548d-3p could be further evaluated as a prognostic marker for ATL and/or as a host-directed therapeutic target. © Copyright © 2021 Souza, Ramos-Sanchez, Muxel, Lagos, Reis, Pereira, Brito, Zampieri, Kaye, Floeter-Winter and Goto."

Objective: This study aimed to describe the epidemiological panorama of CD in the Western Brazilian Amazon from 2007 to 2018. Methods: In this ecological study, secondary data regarding the confirmed cases of T. cruzi infection in the states of Acre, Amazonas, Rondônia, and Roraima were collected from the Single Health System Notification Information System of the Department of Informatics of the Single Health System and were analyzed. The data were used to characterize the epidemiological profile of T. cruzi infection and to determine the frequency of infection in Western Amazonia. Results: A total of 184 cases of CD were reported in Western Amazonia, and the highest number of cases was reported in the states of Amazonas and Acre. Conclusion: The epidemiological panorama of the Western Brazilian Amazon from 2007 to 2018 includes a greater number of cases of T. cruzi infection in men aged 20–39 years and those living in rural areas. Oral transmission was prevalent in the region during the study, and the highest number of cases was reported in the months of April and December.

We infected β2-low expression (CD18low) and wild type (WT) mice with P. brasiliensis 18. Disease progression was evaluated for fungal burden, lung granulomatous lesions, nitrate levels, and serum antibody production. Besides, the in vitro capacity of macrophages to internalize and kill fungal yeasts was investigated. Our results revealed that CD18low mice infected with Pb18 survived during the time analyzed; their lungs showed fewer granulomas, a lower fungal load, lower levels of nitrate, and production of high levels of IgG1 in comparison to WT animals. Our results revealed that in vitro macrophages from CD18low mice slowly internalized yeast cells, showing a lower fungal burden compared to WT cells. The migration capacity of macrophages was compromised and showed a higher intensity in the lysosome signal when compared with WT mice.

Having a very plastic, repetitive and complex genome, the parasite displays a highly diverse repertoire of surface molecules, with pivotal roles in cell invasion, immune evasion and pathogenesis. Before 2016, the complexity of the genomic regions containing these genes impaired the assembly of a genome at chromosomal level, making it impossible to study the structure and function of the several thousand repetitive genes encoding the surface molecules of the parasite. We here describe the genome assembly of the Sylvio X10/1 genome sequence, which since 2016 has been used as a reference genome sequence for T. cruzi clade I (TcI), produced using high coverage PacBio single-molecule sequencing. It was used to analyze deep Illumina sequence data from 34 T. cruzi TcI isolates and clones from different geographic locations, sample sources and clinical outcomes. Resolution of the surface molecule gene distribution showed the unusual duality in the organization of the parasite genome, a synteny of the core genomic region with related protozoa flanked by unique and highly plastic multigene family clusters encoding surface antigens. The presence of abundant interspersed retrotransposons in these multigene family clusters suggests that these elements are involved in a recombination mechanism for the generation of antigenic variation and evasion of the host immune response on these TcI strains. The comparative genomic analysis of the cohort of TcI strains revealed multiple cases of such recombination events involving surface molecule genes and has provided new insights into T. cruzi population structure. © Copyright © 2021 Talavera-López, Messenger, Lewis, Yeo, Reis-Cunha, Matos, Bartholomeu, Calzada, Saldaña, Ramírez, Guhl, Ocaña-Mayorga, Costales, Gorchakov, Jones, Nolan, Teixeira, Carrasco, Bottazzi, Hotez, Murray, Grijalva, Burleigh, Grisard, Miles and Andersson."

It is vectored by triatomines from the genus Rhodnius, in which it invades the hemolymph and infects the salivary glands, avoiding the bug immune responses. In insects, these responses are initiated by well conserved pathways, mainly the IMD, Toll, and Jak/STAT. We hypothesize that long-term infection with T. rangeli in the gut or hemolymph of Rhodnius prolixus triggers different systemic immune responses, which influence the number of parasites that survive inside the vector. Thus, we investigated groups of insects with infections in the gut and/or hemolymph, and evaluated the parasite load and the expression in the fat body of transcription factors (Rp-Relish, Rp-Dorsal, and Rp-STAT) and inhibitors (Rp-Cactus and Rp-Caspar) of the IMD, Toll, and Jak/STAT pathways. We detected lower parasite counts in the gut of insects without hemolymph infection, compared to hemolymph-infected groups. Besides, we measured higher parasite numbers in the gut of bugs that were first inoculated with T. rangeli and then fed on infected mice, compared with control insects, indicating that hemolymph infection increases parasite numbers in the gut. Interestingly, we observed that genes from the three immune pathways where differentially modulated, depending on the region parasites were present, as we found (1) Rp-Relish downregulated in gut-and/or-hemolymph-infected insects, compared with controls; (2) Rp-Cactus upregulated in gut-infected insect, compared with controls and gut-and-hemolymph-infected groups; and (3) Rp-STAT downregulated in all groups of hemolymph-infected insects. Finally, we uncovered negative correlations between parasite loads in the gut and Rp-Relish and Rp-Cactus expression, and between parasite counts in the hemolymph and Rp-Relish levels, suggesting an association between parasite numbers and the IMD and Toll pathways. Overall, our findings reveal new players in R. prolixus–T. rangeli interactions that could be key for the capacity of the bug to transmit the pathogen. © Copyright © 2021 Rolandelli, Nascimento, Silva, Rivera-Pomar and Guarneri."

We were able to predict the exposure status of R. prolixus to T. cruzi with accuracies of 93.6%, 94.2% and 91.8% using logistic regression, a random forest classifier and a gradient boosting machine model, respectively. We extracted the most important features in producing the models and identified the major metabolites which assist in positive classification. This work highlights the complex interactions between triatomine vector and parasite including effects on the metabolic signature of the insect. © 2021 The Authors"

Human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a major public health problem worldwide, leading to significant mortality rates if not properly treated and controlled. Precise identification of infected patients is essential to establish treatment and control measures. Although several VL serological diagnosis advances have been accomplished lately, mainly using recombinant antigens and immunochromatographic tests (ICTs), improvements may still be achieved using multiepitope chimeric proteins in different test platforms. Here, we reported on the evaluation of ELISA and an ICT developed with a new chimeric protein, named DTL-4, based on repetitive antigenic sequences, including those present in the A2 protein. Methods. A total of 1028 sera samples were used for the development and validation of ELISA (321 samples from L. infantum-infected patients, 62 samples from VL/AIDS coinfected patients, 236 samples from patients infected with other diseases, and 409 samples from healthy donors). A total of 520 sera samples were used to develop and validate ICT (249 samples from L. infantum-infected patients, 46 samples from VL/AIDS coinfected patients, 40 samples from patients infected with other diseases, and 185 samples from healthy donors). Findings. Using the validation sera panels, DTL-4-based ELISA displayed an overall sensitivity of 94.61% (95% CI: 89.94-97.28), a specificity of 99.41% (95% CI: 96.39-99.99), and an accuracy of 97.02% (95% CI: 94.61-98.38), while for ICT, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values corresponded to 91.98% (95% CI: 86.65-95.39), 100.00% (95% CI: 96.30-100.00), and 95.14% (95% CI: 91.62-97.15), respectively. When testing sera samples from VL/AIDS coinfected patients, DTL-4-ELISA displayed a sensitivity of 77.42% (95% CI: 65.48-86.16), a specificity of 99.41% (95% CI: 96.39-99.99), and an accuracy of 93.51% (95% CI: 89.49%-96.10%), while for DTL-4-ICT, sensitivity was 73.91% (95% CI: 59.74-84.40), specificity was 90.63% (95% CI: 81.02-95.63), and accuracy was 82.00% (95% CI: 73.63-90.91). Conclusion. DTL-4 is a promising candidate antigen for serodiagnosis of VL patients, including those with VL/AIDS coinfection, when incorporated into ELISA or ICT test formats. © 2021 Maria Marta Figueiredo et al."

Objective: To evaluate the TaqMan probe technology applicability to diagnose and identifying of Leishmania spp. related to the ACL etiology. Methodology: Through the MEGA 6.0 software, performed an in silico analysis using multiple alignments of Leishmania spp. which were available on GenBank for different genomic targets. The efficiency (e), specificity and detection limit (DL) were calculated for each system, these were associated to compose a duplex-qPCR (DqPCR). The samples of blood, lesion biopsy and lesion imprint on filter paper from patients residing in states of Amazonas (AM) and Pernambuco (PE)-Brazil, (cases and controls) were used to perform the DqPCR technique. The capacity to identify the Leishmania species was determined by comparison with isoenzymes method and sequencing analysis. Results: Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (rDNA) was the target selected. Two sets of primers and probes were designed and combined: SVS for subgenus Viannia and LaS for L. (L.) amazonensis. The results were: SVSe = 93.24%, SVS DL = 50 fg/μL; LaSe = 89.3%, LaSLD = 5 fg/μL presented 100% of specificity. In total, 236 individuals participated of the present study, wherein were 101 blood samples, 33 biopsies and 147 lesion imprints. The imprint was the most sensitive sample, showing 83.06% of sensitivity, 86.96% of specificity and substantial agreement between the techniques analysis (k = 0.531; p < 0,001). Regarding the species identification, DqPCR and sequencing/isoenzymes have agreed at 100%, since the infection is caused by a single Leishmania species. Conclusion: The DqPCR technique was applicable in diagnosis and identification of Leishmania spp. (subgenus Viannia and L. amazonensis). Furthermore, the lesion imprint is less invasive, allowing a fewer discomfort and greater acceptance by the patients, in addition of being low cost and easy handling. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

The marsupials are important wild reservoirs of T. cruzi, aiding in the maintenance of this agent in sylvatic and peri-domestic environments. The objective of this study was to report the parasitological and clinicopathological findings of a natural infection by T. cruzi in one specimen of Philander opossum that originated from the Brazilian Amazon. The animal was captured in a forest fragment near a rural community with reports of human Chagas disease. T. cruzi infection was diagnosed by blood smear examinations, blood culture, scent glands secretion culture, histopathological examination, and nested-PCR. Positive samples were subjected to PCR to characterize the discrete typing units (DTUs) of T. cruzi. Characteristic trypomastigotes of T. cruzi were observed in the blood smear, and spheromastigotes, epimastigotes, and trypomastigotes were visualized in the cultures. Non-suppurative myocarditis associated with amastigote clusters was the principal histopathological finding. DNA from T. cruzi was detected in samples of blood, blood cultures, scent glands secretion cultures, cardiac muscles, and the spleen. The TcI and the TcII/V/VI group DTUs were detected in blood culture and scent glands secretion cultures. Infection by T. cruzi can cause myocarditis in P. opossum and DTUs TcI and TcII/V/VI group mixed infection can be detected in the acute phase. P. opossum can be a source of infection for triatomine vectors and has the potential source for direct transmission of T. cruzi by secretions from the scent glands.

Aiming for the establishment of SAR, five different compounds (1a – 1e) were prepared and tested against T. cruzi. The 2-allyl derivative of licarin A (1d) exhibited higher activity against trypomastigotes of T. cruzi (IC50 = 5.0 μM and SI = 9.0), while its heterocyclic derivative 1e displayed IC50 of 10.5 μM and reduced toxicity against NCTC cells (SI &gt; 19.0). However, these compounds presented limited oral bioavailability estimation (&lt;85%, Papp &lt;1.0 × 10−6 cm/s) in parallel artificial membrane permeability assays (PAMPA) due to excessive lipophilicity. Based on these results, different simplified structures of licarin A were designed: vanillin (2), vanillyl alcohol (3), isoeugenol (4), and eugenol (5), as well as its corresponding methyl (a), acetyl (b), O-allyl (c), and C-allyl (d) analogues. Vanillin (2) and its acetyl derivative (2b) displayed expressive activity against intracellular amastigotes of T. cruzi with IC50 values of 5.5 and 5.6 μM, respectively, and reduced toxicity against NCTC cells (CC50 &gt; 200 μM). In addition, these simplified analogues showed a better permeability profile (Papp &gt; 1.0 × 10−6 cm/s) on PAMPA models, resulting in improved drug-likeness. Vanillyl alcohol acetyl derivative (3b) and isoeugenol methyl derivative (4a) displayed activity against the extracellular forms of T. cruzi (trypomastigotes) with IC50 values of 5.1 and 8.8 μM respectively. Based on these results, compounds with higher selectivity index against extracellular forms of the parasite (1d, 1e, 3d, and 4a) were selected for a mechanism of action study. After a short incubation period (1 h) all compounds increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels of trypomastigotes, suggesting cellular oxidative stress. The ATP levels were increased after two hours of incubation, possibly involving a high energy expenditure of the parasite to control the homeostasis. Except for compound 4a, all compounds induced hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, demonstrating a mitochondrial imbalance. Considering the unique mitochondria apparatus of T. cruzi and the lethal alterations induced by structurally based on licarin A, these compounds are interesting hits for future drug discovery studies in Chagas disease. © 2020, The Author(s)."

As a neglected disease, much effort is still needed in treatment and diagnosis. Currently, ATL diagnosis is mainly made by parasite detection by microscopy. The sensitivity of the method varies, and factors such as collection procedures interfere. Molecular approaches, specially based on Real Time PCR (qPCR) technique, has been widely used to detect Leishmania infection and to quantify parasite load, once it is a simple, rapid and sensitive methodology, capable to detect low parasite concentrations and less prone to variability. Although many studies have been already published addressing the use of this technique, an improvement on these methodologies, including an analytical validation, standardization and data association is demanded. Moreover, a proper validation by the assay by the use of clinical samples is still required. In this sense, the purpose of the present work is to compare the performance of qPCR using two commonly used targets (18S rDNA and HSP70) with an internal control (RNAse P) in multiplex reactions. Addition-ally, we validated reactions by assaying 88 samples from patients presenting different clinical forms of leishmaniasis (cutaneous, mucosal, recent and old lesions), representing the diversity found in Brazil’s Amazon Region. Following the methodology proposed herein, the results indicate the use of both qPCR assays, 18S rDNA and HSP70, to achieve a very good net sensitivity (98.5%) and specificity (100%), performing simultaneous or sequential testing, respectively.

It is the etiological agent of American trypanosomiasis, also known as Chagas Disease, which affects about 17 million people in Latin America and is emerging elsewhere in the world. Iron (Fe) is a crucial micronutrient for almost all cells, acting as a cofactor for several metabolic enzymes. T. cruzi has a high requirement for Fe, using heminic and non-heminic Fe for growth and differentiation. Fe occurs in the oxidized (Fe3+) form in aerobic environments and needs to be reduced to Fe2+ before it enters cells. Fe-reductase, located in the plasma membranes of some organisms, catalyzes the Fe3+⇒ Fe2+ conversion. In the present study we found an amino acid sequence in silico that allowed us to identify a novel 35 kDa protein in T. cruzi with two transmembrane domains in the C-terminal region containing His residues that are conserved in the Ferric Reductase Domain Superfamily and are required for catalyzing Fe3+ reduction. Accordingly, we named this protein TcFR. Intact epimastigotes from the T. cruzi DM28c strain reduced the artificial Fe3+-containing substrate potassium ferricyanide in a cell density-dependent manner, following Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The TcFR activity was more than eightfold higher in a plasma membrane-enriched fraction than in whole homogenates, and this increase was consistent with the intensity of the 35 kDa band on Western blotting images obtained using anti-NOX5 raised against the human antigen. Immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated TcFR on the parasite surface. That TcFR is part of a catalytic complex allowing T. cruzi to take up Fe from the medium was confirmed by experiments in which DM28c was assayed after culturing in Fe-depleted medium: (i) proliferation during the stationary growth phase was five times slower; (ii) the relative expression of TcFR (qPCR) was 50% greater; (iii) intact cells had 120% higher Fe-reductase activity. This ensemble of results indicates that TcFR is a conserved enzyme in T. cruzi, and its catalytic properties are modulated in order to respond to external Fe fluctuations. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

Objective: To estimate the risk of developing chronic cardiomyopathy in patients with acute and indeterminate chronic forms of Chagas disease. Data Sources: A systematic search in the Cochrane Library, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Medline, and Web of Science Core Collection databases was conducted from October 8 to October 24, 2018. Studies published between January 1, 1946, and October 24, 2018, that were written in the English, Spanish, and Portuguese languages were included. Search terms included Chagas disease; development of cardiomyopathy; latency duration; and determinants of the Chagas latency period. Study Selection: Longitudinal observational studies of participants diagnosed with the acute phase of Chagas infection or the indeterminate chronic form of Chagas disease who were followed up until the development of cardiomyopathy were included. Studies were excluded if they did not provide sufficient outcome data. Of 10 761 records initially screened, 32 studies met the criteria for analysis.

Recently, metabolomics has emerged as a new technique that could allow for the identification of new biomarkers useful for disease diagnosis or for the understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms, but it has never been assessed in the chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (CKD–MBD) scenario. In this study, we investigated the association between serum metabolites and the bone TMV classification in patients with end-stage renal disease by using serum NMR spectroscopy and bone biopsy of 49 hemodialysis patients from a single center in Brazil. High T was identified in 21 patients and was associated with higher levels of dimethylsulfone, glycine, citrate, and N-acetylornithine. The receiver-operating characteristic curve for the combination of PTH and these metabolites provided an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.86 (0.76 to 0.97). Abnormal M was identified in 30 patients and was associated with lower ethanol. The AUC for age, diabetes mellitus, and ethanol was 0.83 (0.71 to 0.96). Low V was identified in 17 patients and was associated with lower carnitine. The association of age, phosphate, and carnitine provided an AUC of 0.83 (0.70 to 0.96). Although differences among the curves by adding selected metabolites to traditional models were not statistically significant, the accuracy of the diagnosis according to the TMV classification seemed to be improved. This is the first study to evaluate the TMV classification system in relation to the serum metabolome assessed by NMR spectroscopy, showing that selected metabolites may help in the evaluation of bone phenotypes in CKD–MBD. © 2020 The Authors.

The treatment of Chagas disease is directed at eliminating the parasite, decreasing the probability of cardiomyopathy and disrupting the disease transmission cycle. Benznidazole (BZ) and nifurtimox (Nfx) are recognized as effective drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease by the World Health Organization, but both have high toxicity and limited efficacy, especially in the chronic disease phase. At low doses, aspirin (ASA) has been reported to protect against T. cruzi infection. We evaluated the effectiveness of BZ in combination with ASA at low doses during the acute disease phase and evaluated cardiovascular aspects and cardiac lesions in the chronic phase. ASA treatment prevented the cardiovascular dysfunction (hypertension and tachycardia) and typical cardiac lesions. Moreover, BZ ASA-treated mice had a smaller cardiac fibrotic area than BZ-treated mice. These results were associated with an increase in numbers of eosinophils and reticulocytes and levels of nitric oxide in the plasma and cardiac tissue of ASA-treated mice relative to respective controls. These effects of ASA and BZ+ASA in chronically infected mice were inhibited by pretreatment with the lipoxin A4 (LXA4) receptor antagonist Boc-2, indicating that the protective effects of ASA are mediated by ASA-triggered lipoxin. These results emphasize the importance of exploring new drug combinations for treatments of the acute phase of Chagas disease that are beneficial for patients with chronic disease.

Here, the white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann) and its ectoparasite, the deer ked Lipoptena mazamae Rondani, 1878 (hippoboscid fly), were surveyed for trypanosomes in Venezuela. Results: Haemoculturing unveiled 20% infected WTD, while 47% (7/15) of blood samples and 38% (11/29) of ked guts tested positive for the Megatrypanum-specific TthCATL-PCR. CATL and SSU rRNA sequences uncovered a single species of trypanosome. Phylogeny based on SSU rRNA and gGAPDH sequences tightly cluster WTD trypanosomes from Venezuela and the USA, which were strongly supported as geographical variants of the herein described Trypanosoma (Megatrypanum) trinaperronei n. sp. In our analyses, the new species was closest to Trypanosoma sp. D30 from fallow deer (Germany), both nested into TthII alongside other trypanosomes from cervids (North American elk and European fallow, red and sika deer), and bovids (cattle, antelopes and sheep). Insights into the life-cycle of T. trinaperronei n. sp. were obtained from early haemocultures of deer blood and co-culture with mammalian and insect cells showing flagellates resembling Megatrypanum trypanosomes previously reported in deer blood, and deer ked guts. For the first time, a trypanosome from a cervid was cultured and phylogenetically and morphologically (light and electron microscopy) characterised. Conclusions: In the analyses based on SSU rRNA, gGAPDH, CATL and ITS rDNA sequences, neither cervids nor bovids trypanosomes were monophyletic but intertwined within TthI and TthII major phylogenetic lineages. One host species can harbour more than one species/genotype of trypanosome, but each trypanosome species/genotype was found in a single host species or in phylogenetically closely related hosts. Molecular evidence that L. mazamae may transmit T. trinaperronei n. sp. suggests important evolutionary constraints making tight the tripartite T. trinaperronei-WTD-deer ked association. In a plausible evolutionary scenario, T. trinaperronei n. sp. entered South America with North American white-tailed deer at the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary following the closure of the Panama Isthmus.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2020 The Author(s)."

DTUs TcI-TcII-TcV and TcVI are agents of ChD in different regions of Latin America. Due to population movements, the disease is an emergent global public health problem. Thus, the aim of this study was to quantify the parasitic load and identify the presence of T. cruzi DTUs in 101 Latin American immigrants with chronic ChD, residing in Barcelona, Spain. Methodology / Principal findings 5ml of peripheral blood were collected in guanidine/EDTA from each patient for DNA extraction, quantification of the parasitic load and genotyping. A great variation of the parasitic load of the patients was verified: from 0.001 to 22.2 T. cruzi DNA (fg) / Blood DNA (ng). In patients from Bolivia the parasitic load was 3.76±4.43 T. cruzi DNA (fg) / Blood DNA (ng) (mean ± SD), in patients of other countries was 0.95±1.38 T. cruzi DNA (fg) / Blood DNA (ng). No statistically significant difference was observed in the parasitic load between patients with the indeterminate and cardiac forms of ChD (p = 0,57). Parasite genotyping was performed by multilocus conventional PCR. In patients from Bolivia there was a nearly equal prevalence of DTUs TcV (27/77), TcII/TcV/TcVI (26/77), and TcII/TcVI (22/77). TcVI was detected in only 2 samples (2/77). A higher prevalence of TcII/TcVI (19/24) was verified in patients of other countries, with low prevalence of TcII/TcV/TcVI (4/24) and TcV (1/24). Conclusions/Significance In this study, low/medium parasitic load was found in all patients evaluated. Our data corroborate previous conclusions indicating that patients from the Bolivia, living in Spain, are predominantly infected by TcV, and TcVI DTUs. On the other hand, in Non-Bolivians patients TcII/TcVI predominated. Surprisingly, in our cohort of 101 patients no infection by TcI DTU was observed. © 2020 Tavares de Oliveira et al."

It is a chronic, stigmatizing condition, closely associated with poverty and affecting close to 6 million people globally. Although historically the disease was limited to endemic areas of Latin America recent years have seen an increasing global spread. In addition to the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease, the social and economic burdens on individuals and society are substantial. Often called the 'silent killer', Chagas disease is characterized by a long, asymptomatic phase in affected individuals. Approximately 30% then go on develop chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy and other serious cardiac complications such as stroke, rhythm disturbances and severe heart failure. Methods: In a collaboration of the World Hearth Federation (WHF) and the Inter-American Society of Cardiology (IASC) a writing group consisting of 20 diverse experts on Chagas disease (CD) was convened. The group provided up to date expert knowledge based on their area of expertise. An extensive review of the literature describing obstacles to diagnosis and treatment of CD along with proposed solutions was conducted. A survey was sent to all WHF Members and, using snowball sampling to widen the consultation, to a variety of health care professionals working in the CD global health community. The results were analyzed, open comments were reviewed and consolidated, and the findings were incorporated into this document, thus ensuring a consensus representation. Results: The WHF IASC Roadmap on Chagas Disease offers a comprehensive summary of current knowledge on prevention, diagnosis and management of the disease. In providing an analysis of 'roadblocks' in access to comprehensive care for Chagas disease patients, the document serves as a framework from which strategies for implementation such as national plans can be formulated. Several dimensions are considered in the analysis: healthcare system capabilities, governance, financing, community awareness and advocacy. Conclusion: The WHF IASC Roadmap proposes strategies and evidence-based solutions for healthcare professionals, health authorities and governments to help overcome the barriers to comprehensive care for Chagas disease patients. This roadmap describes an ideal patient care pathway, and explores the roadblocks along the way, offering potential solutions based on available research and examples in practice. It represents a call to action to decision-makers and health care professionals to step up efforts to eradicate Chagas disease. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)."

Since conventional treatments with nitroheterocyclic drugs show serious adverse reactions and have questionable efficiency, different research groups have investigated polypeptide-based approaches to interfere with the parasite cell cycle in other Trypanosomatids. These strategies are supported by the fact that surface players are candidates to develop surface ligands that impair function since they may act as virulence factors. In this study, we used a phage display approach to identify peptides from one library-LX8CX8 (17 aa) (where X corresponds to any amino acid). After testing different biopanning conditions using live or fixed epimastigotes, 10 clones were sequenced that encoded the same peptide, named here as EPI18. The bacteriophage expressing EPI18 binds to epimastigotes from distinct strains of T. cruzi. To confirm these results, this peptide was synthetized, biotinylated, and assayed using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy analyses. These assays confirmed the specificity of the binding capacity of EPI18 toward epimastigote surfaces. Our findings suggest that EPI18 may have potential biotechnological applications that include peptide-based strategies to control parasite transmission. © 2020 Elsevier Inc."

Proliferative epimastigotes forms thrive inside the insects in the presence of heme (iron protoporphyrin IX), an abundant product of blood digestion, however little is known about the metabolic outcome of this signaling molecule in the parasite. Trypanosomatids exhibit unusual gene transcription employing a polycistronic transcription mechanism through trans-splicing that regulates its life cycle. Using the Deep Seq transcriptome sequencing we characterized the heme induced transcriptome of epimastigotes and determined that most of the upregulated genes were related to glucose metabolism inside the glycosomes. These results were supported by the upregulation of glycosomal isoforms of PEPCK and fumarate reductase of heme-treated parasites, implying that the fermentation process was favored. Moreover, the downregulation of mitochondrial gene enzymes in the presence of heme also supported the hypothesis that heme shifts the parasite glycosomal glucose metabolism towards aerobic fermentation.

Results: No significant differences were found regarding sex, age and time of diagnosis. Cardiac problems were the most reported clinical sign. A significant difference was observed in the case of the indeterminate form of the disease, which was more predominant in males. In addition, functional classification B1 of CD was more common in women, while B2 predominated in men. Conclusion: A late diagnosis of CD may increase the chances of presenting digestive complications.

Due to its wide distribution in endemic areas, Leishmania (V.) braziliensis is considered one of the most important species in circulation in Brazil. Molecular targets derived from ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were used in studies to identify Leishmania spp.; however, the Intergenic Spacer (IGS) region has not yet been explored in parasite species differentiation. Besides, there is a shortage of sequences deposited in public repositories for this region. Thus, it was proposed to analyze and provide sequences of the IGS rRNA region from different Leishmania spp. and to evaluate their potential as biomarkers to characterize L. braziliensis. A set of primers was designed for complete amplification of the IGS rRNA region of Leishmania spp. PCR products were submitted to Sanger sequencing. The sequences obtained were aligned and analyzed for size and similarity, as well as deposited in GenBank. Characteristics of the repetitive elements (IGSRE) present in the IGS rRNA were also verified. In addition, a set of primers for L. braziliensis identification for qPCR was developed and optimized. Sensitivity (S), specificity (σ), and efficiency (ϵ) tests were applied. It was found that the mean size for the IGS rRNA region is 3 kb, and the similarity analysis of the sequences obtained demonstrated high conservation among the species. It was observed that the size for the IGSRE repetitive region varies between 61 and 71 bp, and there is a high identity between some species. Fifteen sequences generated for the IGS rRNA partial region of nine different species were deposited in GenBank so far.

The laboratory diagnosis of a chronic infection is determined through serological assays for antibodies against T. cruzi and several tests are available that differ in key components, formats and methodologies. To date, no single test meets the criteria of a gold standard. The situation is further complicated by the difficulties associated with performance comparisons between different immunoassays or methodologies executed at different times and geographical areas. OBJECTIVE To improve the diagnosis of Chagas disease, the WHO coordinated the development of two International Biological Reference Standards for antibodies against anti-T. cruzi: NIBSC 09/186 and NIBSC 09/188 that respectively represent geographical regions with the highest prevalence of TcII and TcI lineages of the parasite. METHODS The principle goal of this study was to verify the behavior of these standards when assayed by several commercially available serological tests that employ different methods to capture and detect human anti-T. cruzi antibodies. FINDINGS AND MAIN CONCLUSIONS The results reinforce the recommendation that these standards be considered for performance evaluations of commercialised immunoassays and should be an integral step in the development of new test components or assay paradigms. © 2020, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

Methods: Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FITR), Raman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), dynamic light scattering (DLS) have been used to characterize the silver-xylan nanoparticles (NX). Their cytotoxicity was evaluated with 3-bromo(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) test. MTT and flow cytometry were used to ascertain the anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity. Results: UV-Vis spectroscopy gave plasmon resonance ranging between 400 and 450 nm while FITC and Raman spectroscopy proved nano interface functionalized with xylan. ICP-OES data showed NX with xylan (81%) and silver (19%). EDS showed NX consisting of carbon (59.4%), oxygen (26.2%) and silver (4.8%) main elements. Spherical NX of 55 nm average size has been depicted with SEM and AFM, while DLS showed 102 ± 1.7 nm NX. The NX displayed negligible cytotoxicity (2000 µg/mL). NX (100 µg/mL) was more effective, regardless of experiment time, in affecting the ability of parasites to reduce MTT than BZN (100 µg/mL). In addition, NX (100 µg/mL) induced death of 95% of parasites by necrosis. Conclusion: This is the first time silver nanoparticles are presented as an anti-Trypanosoma cruzi agent and the data point to the potential application of NX to new preclinical studies in vitro and in vivo. © 2020 Brito et al."

CD43 is directly involved in the contact between cells participating in a series of events such as signaling, adherence and host parasite interactions. In this study we examined the role of CD43 in the immune response against Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan parasite that causes Chagas’ disease, a potential life-threatening illness endemic in 21 Latin American countries according to the WHO. The acute stage of infection is marked by intense parasitemia and cardiac tissue parasitism, resulting in the recruitment of inflammatory cells and acute damage to the heart tissue. We show here that CD43−/− mice were more resistant to infection due to increased cytotoxicity of antigen specific CD8+ T cells and reduced inflammatory infiltration in the cardiac tissue, both contributing to lower cardiomyocyte damage. In addition, we demonstrate that the induction of acute myocarditis involves the engagement of CD43 cytoplasmic tripeptide sequence KRR to ezrin-radixin-moiesin cytoskeletal proteins. Together, our results show the participation of CD43 in different events involved in the pathogenesis of T. cruzi infection, contributing to a better overall understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of acute chagasic cardiomyopathy. © 2019, The Author(s)."

Areas covered: The authors discuss the current understanding of benznidazole-based chemotherapy for Chagas disease, focusing specifically on epidemiology, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, clinical recommendations, cure criteria, and therapeutic efficacy in different phases of the disease. Expert opinion: Benznidazole shows high bioavailability after oral administration. Benznidazole at 5–8 mg/kg/day and 5–10 mg/kg/day for 30–60 days are consistent clinical recommendations for children and adults, respectively. A high correlation between negative parasitological, serological, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays in long-term post-therapeutic follow-up has been consistently used to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. These methods support the evidence that the success of benznidazole-based chemotherapy is closely correlated with the phase of infection in which the treatment is administered. The greater therapeutic efficacy is obtained in acute infections, gradually worsening as the infection becomes chronic. When therapeutic failure is confirmed by any diagnostic assay, benznidazole treatment does not always ensure better long-term prognosis, and Chagas cardiomyopathy may develop as well as in untreated patients. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The WHO suggests the use of two distinct commercial serological tests in parallel. The performance of commercial immunoassays might fluctuate depending on the antigenic matrices and the local strains of T. cruzi in different geographical settings. The use of antigenic matrices based on chimeric proteins can solve these limitations. Here, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of two chimeric T. cruzi antigens (IBMP-8.1 and -8.4) to diagnose chronic Chagas disease in individuals from endemic South American countries. Methodology/Principal findings IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens were expressed as soluble proteins in E. coli and purified using chromatography methods. Reactivity of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 was assessed using an in-house ELISA with sera from 122 non-infected and 215 T. cruzi-infected individuals from Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. Cut-off values were based on ROC curves and performance parameters were determined using a dichotomous approach. Area under the curve values were > 99.7% for both IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 antigens. IgG levels in T. cruzi-positive and negative samples were higher for IBMP-8.4 than IBMP-8.1. Both IBMP-8.1 and -8.4 were 100% specific, while IBMP-8.4 were 100% sensitive compared to IBMP-8.1 (95.3%). Admitting RI values of 1.0 ± 0.10 as the inconclusive interval, 6.2% of the samples tested using IBMP-8.1 and 2.1% using IBMP-8.4 fell inside the grey zone. Based on accuracy and diagnostic odds ratio values, IBMP-8.4 presented the best performance. Differences in sensitivity and IgG levels among the samples from Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay were not significant. Conclusions/Significance Our findings showed a notable performance of IBMP-8.1 and -8.4 chimeric antigens in diagnosing chronic Chagas disease in individuals from endemic South American countries, confirming our hypothesis that these antigens could be used in geographical areas where distinct T. cruzi DTUs occur. © 2019 Del-Rei et al.

Indeed, this disease, which is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is no longer just a problem for the American continents but has become a global health threat. Current therapies, i.e., nifurtimox and benznidazole (Bz), are far from being adequate, due to their undesirable effects and their lack of efficacy in the chronic phases of the disease. In this work, we present an in-depth phenotypic evaluation in T. cruzi of a new class of imidazole compounds, which were discovered in a previous phenotypic screen against different trypanosomatids and were designed as potential inhibitors of cAMP phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The confirmation of several activities similar or superior to that of Bz prompted a synthesis program of hit optimization and extended structure-activity relationship aimed at improving drug-like properties such as aqueous solubility, which resulted in additional hits with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values similar to that of Bz. The cellular effects of one representative hit, compound 9, on bloodstream trypomastigotes were further investigated. Transmission electron microscopy revealed cellular changes, after just 2 h of incubation with the IC50 concentration, that were consistent with induced autophagy and osmotic stress, mechanisms previously linked to cAMP signaling. Compound 9 induced highly significant increases in both cellular and medium cAMP levels, confirming that inhibition of T. cruzi PDE(s) is part of its mechanism of action. The potent and selective activity of this imidazole-based PDE inhibitor class against T. cruzi constitutes a successful repurposing of research into inhibitors of mammalian PDEs.

Antibody response varies in accordance to each T. cruzi strain, presenting challenges to the use of antigens lacking demonstrated cross-reactivity with Leishmania spp. Our group expressed four chimeric proteins (IBMP-8.1, IBMP-8.2, IBMP-8.3, and IBMP-8.4) and previously assessed their diagnostic performance to determine cross-reactivity with Leishmania spp. Here, we validated our findings using serum samples from different Brazilian geographic areas reporting endemic Chagas disease, endemic visceral or American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL), or both. Overall, 829 serum samples were evaluated using commercial and IBMP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Due to the absence of a reference assay to diagnosis CD, latent class analysis (LCA) was performed through the use of a statistical model. The incidence of cross-reactivity for ACL-positive samples varied from 0.35% (IBMP-8.3) to 0.70% (IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.2). Regarding visceral leishmaniasis (VL)-positive samples, the IBMP-8.2 and IBMP-8.3 antigens cross-reacted with six (3.49%) and with only one sample (0.58%), respectively. No cross-reactivity with either ACL or VL was observed for the IBMP-8.4 antigen. Similarly, no cross-reactions were found when VL-positive samples were assayed with IBMP-8.1. The agreement among the results obtained using IBMP antigens ranged from 97.3% for IBMP-8.2 and 99% for IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.3 to 100% for IBMP-8.4, demonstrating almost perfect agreement with LCA. Accordingly, in light of the negligible cross-reactivity with both ACL and VL, we suggest the use of IBMP antigens in regions where T. cruzi and Leishmania spp. are coendemic.

Other South American countries have also reported outbreaks of acute Chagas disease associated with food consumption. A conspicuous feature of this route of transmission is presenting symptoms such as facial and lower limbs edema, in some cases bleeding manifestations and risk of thromboembolism are evident. Notwithstanding, studies that address this route of infection are largely lacking regarding its pathogenesis and, more specifically, the crosstalk between immune and hemostatic systems. Here, BALB/c mice were orally infected with metacyclic trypomastigotes of T. cruzi Tulahuén strain and used to evaluate the cytokine response, primary and secondary hemostasis during acute T. cruzi infection. When compared with control uninfected animals, orally infected mice presented higher pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6) serum levels. The highest concentrations were obtained concomitantly to the increase of parasitemia, between 14 and 28 days post-infection (dpi). Blood counts in the oral infected group revealed concomitant leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia, the latter resulting in increased bleeding at 21 dpi. Hematological changes paralleled with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, Factor VIII consumption and increased D-dimer levels, suggest that oral T. cruzi infection relies on disseminated intravascular coagulation. Remarkably, blockade of the IL-6 receptor blunted hematological abnormalities, revealing a critical role of IL-6 in the course of oral infection. These results unravel that acute T. cruzi oral infection results in significant alterations in the hemostatic system and indicates the relevance of the crosstalk between inflammation and hemostasis in this parasitic disease.

Objective: Synthesis and evaluation of antitrypanosomal activities of a series of thiosemicarbazones and semicarbazones containing 1,2,3-1H triazole isatin scaffold. Method: 5'-(4-alkyl/aryl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-isatins were prepared by Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and the thiosemicarbazones and semicarbazones were obtained by the 1:1 reactions of the carbonylated derivatives with thiosemicarbazide and semicarbazide hydrochloride, respectively, in methanol, using conventional reflux or microwave heating. The compounds were assayed for in vitro trypanocidal activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease. Beyond the thio/semicarbazone derivatives, isatin and triazole synthetic intermediates were also evaluated for comparison. Results: A series of compounds were prepared in good yields. Among the 37 compounds evaluated, 18 were found to be active, in particular thiosemicarbazones containing a non-polar saturated alkyl chain (IC50 = 24.1, 38.6, and 83.2 µM; SI = 11.6, 11.8, and 14.0, respectively). To further elucidate the mechanism of action of these new compounds, the redox behaviour of some active and inactive derivatives was studied by cyclic voltammetry. Molecular docking studies were also performed in two validated protein targets of Trypanosoma cruzi, i.e., cruzipain (CRZ) and phosphodiesterase C (TcrPDEC). Conclusion: A class of thio/semicarbazones structurally simple and easily accessible was synthesized. Compounds containing thiosemicarbazone moieties showed the best results in the series, being more active than the corresponding semicarbazones. Our results indicated that the activity of these compounds does not originate from an oxidation-reduction pathway but probably from the interactions with trypanosomal enzymes. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers."

In addition, the Trypanosoma cruzi infection is transmitted congenitally from a chagasic mother to her offspring, but the male partner’s contribution to in utero contamination is unknown. The findings of nests and clumps of amastigotes and of trypomastigotes in the theca cells of the ovary, in the goniablasts and in the lumen of seminiferous tubules suggest that T. cruzi infections are sexually transmitted. The research protocol herein presents the results of a family study population showing parasite nuclear DNA in the diploid blood mononuclear cells and in the haploid gametes of human subjects. Thus, three independent biological samples collected one year apart confirmed that T. cruzi infections were sexually transmitted to progeny. Interestingly, the specific T. cruzi antibody was absent in the majority of family progeny that bore immune tolerance to the parasite antigen. Immune tolerance was demonstrated in chicken refractory to T. cruzi after the first week of embryonic growth, and chicks hatched from the flagellate-inoculated eggs were unable to produce the specific antibody. Moreover, the instillation of the human semen ejaculates intraperitoneally or into the vagina of naive mice yielded T. cruzi amastigotes in the epididymis, seminiferous tubule, vas deferens and uterine tube with an absence of inflammatory reactions in the immune privileged organs of reproduction. The breeding of T. cruzi-infected male and female mice with naive mates resulted in acquisition of the infections, which were later transmitted to the progeny. Therefore, a robust education, information and communication program that involves the population and social organizations is deemed necessary to prevent Chagas disease. © 2019 Journal of Visualized Experiments."

The nitroderivatives used in current chemotherapy are far from ideal and present severe limitations, justifying the continuous search for alternative drugs. Since the1990s, our group has been investigating the trypanocidal activity of natural naphthoquinones and their derivatives, and three naphthoimidazoles (N1, N2 and N3) derived from β-lapachone were found to be most effective in vitro. Analysis of their mechanism of action via cellular, molecular and proteomic approaches indicates that the parasite mitochondrion contains one of the primary targets of these compounds, trypanothione synthetase (involved in trypanothione production), which is overexpressed after treatment with these compounds. Here, we further evaluated the participation of the mitochondria and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the anti-T. cruzi action of naphthoimidazoles. Preincubation of epimastigotes and trypomastigotes with antioxidants (α-tocopherol and urate) strongly protected the parasites from the trypanocidal effect of naphthoimidazoles, decreasing the ROS levels produced and reverting the mitochondrial swelling phenotype. The addition of pro-oxidants (menadione and H2O2) before the treatment induced an increase in parasite lysis. Despite the O2 uptake and mitochondrial complex activity being strongly reduced by N1, N2 and N3, urate partially restored the mitochondrial metabolism only in N1-treated parasites. In parallel, MitoTEMPO, a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, protected the functionality of the mitochondria in N2- and N3-treated parasites. In addition, the trypanothione reductase activity was remarkably increased after treatment with N1 and N3, and molecular docking demonstrated that these two compounds were positioned in pockets of this enzyme. Based on our findings, the direct impairment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain by N2 and N3 led to an oxidative misbalance, which exacerbated ROS generation and led to parasite death. Although other mechanisms cannot be discounted, mainly in N1-treated parasites, further investigations are required. © 2018 Elsevier Inc."

In this context, antigens able to be recognized by antibodies in sera from both VL and TL patients will be desirable to be employed in a more sensitivity and specific diagnosis of disease. In the present study, a conserved Leishmania protein, small myristoylated protein-3 (SMP-3), which was showed to be conserved in different Leishmania species and an effective vaccine candidate against Leishmania infantum infection in a murine model, was cloned and the recombinant protein was evaluated as a serological marker for the diagnosis of human TL and canine VL. In addition, a linear B cell-specific epitope (MQKDEESGEFKCEL) was identified, synthetized and also investigated as a serological marker. As antigen controls, rA2 protein and antigenic Leishmania extracts (SLA) were used. Results showed that ELISA-rSMP-3 and ELISA-Peptide presented sensitivity and specificity values higher than 90% in both diseases in humans and canids, having identified all asymptomatic cases and did not present cross-reaction with cross-reactivity diseases in both mammalian hosts.

Largely nonpathogenic T. rangeli and T. conorhini represent clades that are phylogenetically closely related to the T. cruzi and T. cruzi-like taxa and provide insights into the evolution of pathogenicity in those parasites. T. rangeli, like T. cruzi is endemic in many Latin American countries, whereas T. conorhini is tropicopolitan. T. rangeli and T. conorhini are exclusively extracellular, while T. cruzi has an intracellular stage in the mammalian host. Results: Here we provide the first comprehensive sequence analysis of T. rangeli AM80 and T. conorhini 025E, and provide a comparison of their genomes to those of T. cruzi G and T. cruzi CL, respectively members of T. cruzi lineages TcI and TcVI. We report de novo assembled genome sequences of the low-virulent T. cruzi G, T. rangeli AM80, and T. conorhini 025E ranging from ~ 21-25 Mbp, with ~ 10,000 to 13,000 genes, and for the highly virulent and hybrid T. cruzi CL we present a ~ 65 Mbp in-house assembled haplotyped genome with ~ 12,500 genes per haplotype. Single copy orthologs of the two T. cruzi strains exhibited ~ 97% amino acid identity, and ~ 78% identity to proteins of T. rangeli or T. conorhini. Proteins of the latter two organisms exhibited ~ 84% identity. T. cruzi CL exhibited the highest heterozygosity. T. rangeli and T. conorhini displayed greater metabolic capabilities for utilization of complex carbohydrates, and contained fewer retrotransposons and multigene family copies, i.e. trans-sialidases, mucins, DGF-1, and MASP, compared to T. cruzi. Conclusions: Our analyses of the T. rangeli and T. conorhini genomes closely reflected their phylogenetic proximity to the T. cruzi clade, and were largely consistent with their divergent life cycles.

Their origins, phylogenetic relationships, and emergence as human parasites have long been subjects of interest. In the present study, taxon-rich analyses (20 trypanosome species from bats and terrestrial mammals) using ssrRNA, glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH), heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) and Spliced Leader RNA sequences, and multilocus phylogenetic analyses using 11 single copy genes from 15 selected trypanosomes, provide increased resolution of relationships between species and clades, strongly supporting two main sister lineages: lineage Schizotrypanum, comprising T. cruzi and bat-restricted trypanosomes, and Tra[Tve-Tco] formed by T. rangeli, Trypanosoma vespertilionis and Trypanosoma conorhini clades. Tve comprises European T. vespertilionis and African T. vespertilionis-like of bats and bat cimicids characterised in the present study and Trypanosoma sp. Hoch reported in monkeys and herein detected in bats. Tco included the triatomine-transmitted tropicopolitan T. conorhini from rats and the African NanDoum1 trypanosome of civet (carnivore). Consistent with their very close relationships, Tra[Tve-Tco] species shared highly similar Spliced Leader RNA structures that were highly divergent from those of Schizotrypanum. In a plausible evolutionary scenario, a bat trypanosome transmitted by cimicids gave origin to the deeply rooted Tra[Tve-Tco] and Schizotrypanum lineages, and bat trypanosomes of diverse genetic backgrounds jumped to new hosts. A long and independent evolutionary history of T. rangeli more related to Old World trypanosomes from bats, rats, monkeys and civets than to Schizotrypanum spp., and the adaptation of these distantly related trypanosomes to different niches of shared mammals and vectors, is consistent with the marked differences in transmission routes, life-cycles and host-parasite interactions, resulting in T. cruzi (but not T. rangeli) being pathogenic to humans. © 2018 Australian Society for Parasitology"

In the present work, we evaluate through different approaches (molecular docking, structure activity relationships, CYP51 inhibitory assay, and phenotypic screenings in vitro and in vivo) the potency and selectivity of a novel CYP51 inhibitor (compound 1) and its analogues against T.cruzi infection. Regarding anti-parasitic effect, compound 1 was active in vitro with EC50 3.86 and 4.00 μM upon intracellular (Tulahuen strain) and bloodstream forms (Y strain), respectively. In vivo assays showed that compound 1 reduced in 43% the parasitemia peak but, unfortunately failed to promote animal survival.

Over the last 30 years, Chagas disease has expanded from a neglected parasitic infection of the rural population to an urbanized chronic disease, becoming a potentially emergent global health problem. T. cruzi strains were assigned to seven genetic groups (TcI-TcVI and TcBat), named discrete typing units (DTUs), which represent a set of isolates that differ in virulence, pathogenicity and immunological features. Indeed, diverse clinical manifestations (from asymptomatic to highly severe disease) have been attempted to be related to T.cruzi genetic variability. Due to that, several DTU typing methods have been introduced. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks such as high complexity and analysis time and all of them are based on genetic signatures. Recently, a novel method discriminated bacterial strains using a peptide identification-free, genome sequence-independent shotgun proteomics workflow. Here, we aimed to develop a Trypanosoma cruzi Strain Typing Assay using MS/MS peptide spectral libraries, named Tc-STAMS2. Methods/Principal findings: The Tc-STAMS2 method uses shotgun proteomics combined with spectral library search to assign and discriminate T. cruzi strains independently on the genome knowledge. The method is based on the construction of a library of MS/MS peptide spectra built using genotyped T. cruzi reference strains. For identification, the MS/MS peptide spectra of unknown T. cruzi cells are identified using the spectral matching algorithm SpectraST. The Tc-STAMS2 method allowed correct identification of all DTUs with high confidence. The method was robust towards different sample preparations, length of chromatographic gradients and fragmentation techniques. Moreover, a pilot inter-laboratory study showed the applicability to different MS platforms. Conclusions and significance: This is the first study that develops a MS-based platform for T. cruzi strain typing. Indeed, the Tc-STAMS2 method allows T. cruzi strain typing using MS/MS spectra as discriminatory features and allows the differentiation of TcI-TcVI DTUs. Similar to genomic-based strategies, the Tc-STAMS2 method allows identification of strains within DTUs. Its robustness towards different experimental and biological variables makes it a valuable complementary strategy to the current T. cruzi genotyping assays. Moreover, this method can be used to identify DTU-specific features correlated with the strain phenotype. © 2018 de Oliveira et al."

Anti-vimentin antibodies were present in most American trypanosomiasis samples, but notably, they are much more present in acute (76, 9%) or clinical defined syndromes, especially cardiac disease (87, 9%). Paradoxically, they were relatively infrequent in asymptomatic (25%) infected patients, which had a clearly positive serological reaction to parasite antigens, but had low frequency of anti-vimentin antibodies, similar to controls (2,5%). Conclusion: Our current data revealed that anti-vimentin antibodies induced during T. cruzi infection could be a marker of active disease in the host and its levels could also justify drug therapy in American Trypanosomiasis chronic infection, as a large group of asymptomatic patients would be submitted to treatment with frequent adverse reactions of the available drugs. Anti-vimentin antibodies could be a marker of cardiac muscle cell damage, appearing in American Trypanosomiasis patients during active muscle cell damage. © 2018, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

The disease affects most of the Latin American countries, being considered one of the leading causes of morbidity and death in the continent. The pathogenesis of Chagas cardiomyopathy is very complex, with mechanisms involving parasite-dependent cytopathy, immune-mediated myocardial damage and neurogenic disturbances. These pathological changes eventually result in cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure and stroke during chronic infection phase. Herein, we show that miR-208a, a microRNA that is a key factor in promoting cardiovascular dysfunction during cardiac hypertrophy processes of heart failure, has its circulating levels increased during chronic indeterminate phase when compared to cardiac (CARD) clinical forms in patients with Chagas disease. In contrast, we have not found altered serum levels of miR-34a, a microRNA known to promote pro-apoptotic role in myocardial infarction during degenerative process of cardiac injuries thus indicating intrinsic differences in the nature of the mechanisms underlying the heart failure triggered by Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Our findings support that the chronic indeterminate phase is a progressive phase involved in the genesis of chagasic cardiopathy and point out the use of plasma levels of miR-208a as candidate biomarker in risk-prediction score for the clinical prognosis of Chagas disease. © 2018 Linhares-Lacerda, Granato, Gomes-Neto, Conde, Freire-de-Lima, de Freitas, Freire-de-Lima, Coutinho Barroso, Jorge de Alcântara Guerra, Pedrosa, Savino and Morrot."

Moreover, our weighted pathway regulation analysis incorporated the contributions of all affected genes, eliminating the arbitrary cut-off criteria of fold-change and/or p-value for significantly regulated genes. The new analyses revealed that T. cruzi infection had large transcriptomic consequences for the CMC pathway and triggered a huge cytokine signaling.

Studies have shown that the use of aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), influences the pathogenesis of the disease. However, this remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequences of treatment with low doses of aspirin during the chronic phase of Chagas’ disease on oesophageal function. Twenty male Swiss mice, 60 days of age, were used. The animals were infected with Y strain of Trypanosoma cruzi, injected intraperitoneally. Aspirin was given at a dose of 50 mg/kg to some of the infected animals, from the 55th to 63rd day after inoculation on consecutive days, and from the 65th to 75th day on alternate days. We investigated food passage of time, wall structure and nitrergic neuronal population of the distal oesophagus. Our data revealed that the use of low doses of aspirin in chronic Chagas’ disease caused an increase in the number of nitrergic neurons and partially prevented hypertrophy of the oesophagus. In addition, the aspirin administration impeded Chagas' diseases associated changes in intestinal transit time. Thus treatment with aspirin in the chronic phase of Chagas’ disease changes the natural history of the disease and raises the possibility of using it as a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of this aspect of Chagas' disease pathology. © 2018 The Authors.

Therefore, new drugs to treat this disease are necessary. Thiazole compounds have been described as potent trypanocidal agents. Here we report the structural planning, synthesis and anti-T. cruzi evaluation of a new series of 1,3-thiazoles (7–28), which were designed by placing this heterocycle instead of thiazolidin-4-one ring. The synthesis was conducted in an ultrasonic bath with 2-propanol as solvent at room temperature. By varying substituents attached to the phenyl and thiazole rings, substituents were observed to retain, enhance or greatly increase their anti-T. cruzi activity. In some cases, methyl at position 5 of the thiazole (compounds 9, 12 and 23) increased trypanocidal property. The exchange of phenyl for pyridinyl heterocycle resulted in increased activity, giving rise to the most potent compound against the trypomasigote form (14, IC50trypo = 0.37 μM). Importantly, these new thiazoles were toxic for trypomastigotes without affecting macrophages and cardiomyoblast viability. The compounds were also evaluated against cruzain, and five of the most active compounds against trypomastigotes (7, 9, 12, 16 and 23) inhibited more than 70% of enzymatic activity at 10 μM, among which compound 7 had an IC50 in the submicromolar range, suggesting a possible mechanism of action. In addition, examination of T. cruzi cell death showed that compound 14 induces apoptosis. We also examined the activity against intracellular parasites, revealing that compound 14 inhibited T. cruzi infection with potency similar to benznidazole. The antiparasitic effect of 14 and benznidazole in combination was also investigated against trypomastigotes and revealed that they have synergistic effects, showing a promising profile for drug combination. Finally, in mice acutely-infected with T. cruzi, 14 treatment significanty reduced the blood parasitaemia and had a protective effect on mortality. In conclusion, we report the identification of compounds (7), (12), (15), (23) and (26) with similar trypanocidal activity of benznidazole; compounds (9) and (21) as trypanocidal agents equipotent with BDZ, and compound 14 with potency 28 times better than the reference drug without affecting macrophages and cardiomyoblast viability.

The infective trypomastigote forms of the parasite can invade several human blood cell populations, including monocytes and dendritic cells (DC). Although these cells display a wide functional diversity, their interactions with T. cruzi via cyclooxygenase (COX) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dependent pathways have not been analyzed. To exploiting this mechanism, DC-enriched peripheral human blood mononuclear cell populations (DC-PBMC) were used as our model. Our results showed that the treatment of these cell populations with celecoxib (CEL), a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor or SQ 22,536, an adenilate cyclase inhibitor, significantly caused marked inhibition of T. cruzi infection. In contrast, aspirin (ASA, a non-selective COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor) treatment did not inhibit the infection of the cells by the parasite and was independent of nitric oxide (NO) production. The expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 were similar on cells treated or not with both COX-inhibitors. The infection stimulated the release of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 production by infected cells. Treatment with ASA or CEL did not affect TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and NO production by infected cells, but increased IL-1β production by them. Our results suggest a key role of COX-2 and cAMP pathways in T. cruzi invasion process of human blood cells and these pathways may represent targets of new therapeutic options for Cd. © 2017 Lonien, Malvezi, Suzukawa, Yamauchi, Yamada-Ogatta, Rizzo, Bordignon and Pinge-Filho."

New therapies for this disease are urgently needed, as the only two drugs available (nifurtimox and benznidazol) have high toxicity and variable efficacy in the disease’s chronic phase. Recently, a new chemical entity (NCE) named Pyranaphthoquinone (IVS320) was synthesized from lawsone. We report herein, a detailed study of the physicochemical properties and in vitro trypanocidal activity of IVS320. A series of assays were performed for characterization, where thermal, diffractometric, and morphological analysis were performed. In addition, the solubility, permeability, and hygroscopicity of IVS320 were determined. The results show that its poor solubility and low permeability may be due to its high degree of crystallinity (99.19%), which might require the use of proper techniques to increase the IVS320’s aqueous solubility and permeability. The trypanocidal activity study demonstrated that IVS320 is more potent than the reference drug benznidazole, with IC50/24 h of 1.49 ± 0.1 µM, which indicates that IVS320 has potential as a new drug candidate for the treatment of Chagas disease. © 2017 by the authors"

Evidence suggests that the cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX) is involved in the T. cruzi invasion process. The use of low-dose aspirin (ASA), a COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor, has been shown to reduce infection with T. cruzi. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effects of treatment with low-dose ASA on myenteric colonic neurons during murine infection with T. cruzi. Methods: Swiss mice were assigned into groups treated with either phosphate-buffered saline or low doses of ASA during the acute phase (20 mg/kg ASA) and chronic phase (50 mg/kg ASA) of infection with the Y strain of T. cruzi. Seventy-five days after infection, colon samples were collected to quantify inflammatory foci in histological sections and also general (myosin-V+), nitrergic, and VIPergic myenteric neurons in whole mounts. Gastrointestinal transit time was also measured. Key Results: Aspirin treatment during the acute phase of infection reduced parasitemia (P&lt;.05). Aspirin treatment during the acute or chronic phase of the infection reduced the intensity of inflammatory foci in the colon, protected myenteric neurons from cell death and plastic changes, and recovered the gastrointestinal transit of mice infected with T. cruzi (P&lt;.05). Conclusion &amp; Inferences: Early and delayed treatment with low-dose ASA can reduce the morphofunctional damage of colonic myenteric neurons caused by murine T. cruzi infection. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd"

changes in health across locations is useful to compare and contrast changing epidemiological patterns against health system performance and identify specific needs for resource allocation in research, policy development, and programme decision making. Using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we drew from two widely used summary measures to monitor such changes in population health: disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We used these measures to track trends and benchmark progress compared with expected trends on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Methods: We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost and years of life lived with disability for each location, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using age-specific death rates and years of life lived with disability per capita. We explored how DALYs and HALE difered from expected trends when compared with the SDI: the geometric mean of income per person, educational attainment in the population older than age 15 years, and total fertility rate. Findings: The highest globally observed HALE at birth for both women and men was in Singapore, at 75·2 years (95% uncertainty interval 71·9-78·6) for females and 72·0 years (68·8-75·1) for males. The lowest for females was in the Central African Republic (45·6 years [42·0-49·5]) and for males was in Lesotho (41·5 years [39·0-44·0]). From 1990 to 2016, global HALE increased by an average of 6·24 years (5·97-6·48) for both sexes combined. Global HALE increased by 6·04 years (5·74-6·27) for males and 6·49 years (6·08-6·77) for females, whereas HALE at age 65 years increased by 1·78 years (1·61-1·93) for males and 1·96 years (1·69-2·13) for females. Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2016 (-2·3% [-5·9 to 0·9]), with decreases in communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) disease DALYs ofset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The exemplars, calculated as the fve lowest ratios of observed to expected age-standardised DALY rates in 2016, were Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Maldives, Peru, and Israel. The leading three causes of DALYs globally were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and lower respiratory infections, comprising 16·1% of all DALYs. Total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most CMNN causes decreased from 1990 to 2016. Conversely, the total DALY burden rose for most NCDs; however, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined globally. Interpretation: At a global level, DALYs and HALE continue to show improvements. At the same time, we observe that many populations are facing growing functional health loss. Rising SDI was associated with increases in cumulative years of life lived with disability and decreases in CMNN DALYs ofset by increased NCD DALYs. Relative compression of morbidity highlights the importance of continued health interventions, which has changed in most locations in pace with the gross domestic product per person, education, and family planning. The analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework with which to benchmark location-specific health performance. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform health policies, health system improvement initiatives, targeted prevention eforts, and development assistance for health, including fnancial and research investments for all countries, regardless of their level of sociodemographic development. The presence of countries that substantially outperform others suggests the need for increased scrutiny for proven examples of best practices, which can help to extend gains, whereas the presence of underperforming countries suggests the need for devotion of extra attention to health systems that need more robust support. © The Author(s).

Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specifc mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. Methods: We estimated cause-specifc deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specifc causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specifc deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. Findings: The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72·3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71·2-73·2) of deaths in 2016 with 19·3% (18·5-20·4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8·43% (8·00-8·67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16 - age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1·80 million deaths (95% UI 1·59 million to 1·89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in ages 90-94 years and a 210% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL signifcantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2·89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1·59%) during the same interval. Globally, the fve leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a fner level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. Interpretation: The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and confict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might refect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which efective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

In order to develop diagnostic and therapeutic solutions, there has been an intense investigation on the parasite biology using omics technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics lipidomics and proteomics. In particular, large scale mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies have allowed the identification and quantification of proteins and selected PTMs in different biological conditions. In this study, we investigated the unassigned MS/MS spectra commonly observed in large scale bottom up proteomics experiments looking at the T. cruzi (Sylvio X10/1) proteome. A deep proteomics data analysis using proteogenomic and unrestrictive PTMs search approaches allowed us to annotate 30% more MS/MS spectra and identify novel DNA coding regions and uncharacterized PTMs in Trypanosomatids, such as protein arginylation. Overall, this study shows: (1) the importance of assigning protein modifications, analytical artefacts and PTMs, in large-scale mass spectrometry-based proteomics data to deeply profile the trypanosomatids proteome.

Therefore, the discovery of alternative drugs for treating chronic Chagas disease requires immediate action. In this work, we evaluated the mushroom Pleurotus salmoneostramineus in the search for potential antiparasitic compounds. Methods: Fruit bodies of the basidiomycete Pleurotus salmoneostramineus were triturated and submitted to organic solvent extraction. After liquid-liquid partition of the crude extract, three fractions were obtained and the bioguided fractionation study was conducted to isolate the active metabolites. The elucidation of the chemical structure was performed using GC-MS and NMR techniques. The biological assays for antiparasitic activity were carried out using trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi and murine macrophages for mammalian cytotoxicity. The mechanism of action of the isolated compound used different fluorescent probes to evaluate the plasma membrane permeability, the potential of the mitochondrial membrane and the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Results: The most abundant fraction showing the antiparasitic activity was isolated and chemically elucidated, confirming the presence of ergosterol. It showed anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity against trypomastigotes, with an IC50 value of 51.3 μg/mL. The compound demonstrated no cytotoxicity against mammalian cells to the maximal tested concentration of 200 μg/mL. The mechanism of action of ergosterol in Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes resulted in permeabilization of the plasma membrane, as well as depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to parasite death. Nevertheless, no increase in ROS levels could be observed, suggesting damages to plasma membrane rather than an induction of oxidative stress in the parasite. Conclusions: The selection of naturally antiparasitic secondary metabolites in basidiomycetes, such as ergosterol, may provide potential scaffolds for drug design studies against neglected diseases. © 2017 The Author(s)."

Here, we evaluated the presence of T. cruzi Dm28c luciferase (Dm28c-luc) parasites in orally infected mice, by bioluminescence and quantitative real-time PCR. In vivo bioluminescent images indicated the nasomaxillary region as the site of parasite invasion in the host, becoming consistently infected throughout the acute phase. At later moments, 7 and 21 days post-infection (dpi), luminescent signal is denser in the thorax, abdomen and genital region, because of parasite dissemination in different tissues. Ex vivo analysis demonstrated that the nasomaxillary region, heart, mandibular lymph nodes, liver, spleen, brain, epididymal fat associated to male sex organs, salivary glands, cheek muscle, mesenteric fat and lymph nodes, stomach, esophagus, small and large intestine are target tissues at latter moments of infection. In the same line, amastigote nests of Dm28c GFP T. cruzi were detected in the nasal cavity of 6 dpi mice. Parasite quantification by real-time qPCR at 7 and 21 dpi showed predominant T. cruzi detection and expansion in mouse nasal cavity. Moreover, T. cruzi DNA was also observed in the mandibular lymph nodes, pituitary gland, heart, liver, small intestine and spleen at 7 dpi, and further, disseminated to other tissues, such as the brain, stomach, esophagus and large intestine at 21 dpi. Our results clearly demonstrated that oral cavity and adjacent compartments is the main target region in oral T. cruzi infection leading to parasite multiplication at the nasal cavity. © 2017 Silva-dos-Santos et al."

About 30% of infected patients will develop chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), an inflammatory cardiomyopathy characterized by hypertrophy, fibrosis, and myocarditis. Further studies are necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms of disease progression. Transcriptome analysis has been increasingly used to identify molecular changes associated with disease outcomes. We thus assessed the whole-blood transcriptome of patients with Chagas disease. Microarray analysis was performed on blood samples from 150 subjects, of whom 30 were uninfected control patients and 120 had Chagas disease (1 group had asymptomatic disease, and 2 groups had CCC with either a preserved or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]). Each Chagas disease group displayed distinct gene expression and functional pathway profiles. The most different expression patterns were between CCC groups with a preserved or reduced LVEF. A more stringent analysis indicated that 27 differentially expressed genes, particularly those related to natural killer (NK)/CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, separated the 2 groups. NK/CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity could play a role in determining Chagas disease progression. Understanding genes associated with disease may lead to improved insight into CCC pathogenesis and the identification of prognostic factors for CCC progression. © The Author 2016.

Serology is not frequently used for the diagnosis of the TL form because low antibody titers and cross-reaction with VL. Therefore, it is crucial to identify specific and immunogenic antigens from species associated with the TL form. Here we employed a proteomic approach coupled to an in silico analysis and identified the most abundant and immunogenic proteins from Leishmania amazonensis, Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania infantum. Of 16 species specific proteins, nine were from the species causative of the TL form (L. amazonensis and L. braziliensis). In silico analysis revealed 18 B-cell epitopes with 0% similarity to Trypanosoma cruzi orthologs and, therefore, less likely to crossreact with sera of patients with Chagas disease. Two proteins reacted exclusively with serum from TL patients and presented several B-cell epitopes without similarity to T. cruzi orthologs: the hypothetical protein GI 134063939 and the metallo-peptidase Clan MA(E)-Family M3. The immunoassay revealed nine peptides with strong reactivity to sera from TL patients. These proteins and peptides may be good candidates to improve the specificity and sensibility of serological tests aiming to diagnose the TL of this neglected human disease. Biological significance As no gold-standard test for tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) exists, a combination of different diagnostic techniques is often necessary to obtain precise results. Thus, the identification of species-specific, highly immunogenic and abundant proteins that stimulate the humoral immune response in the host should help in the development of serological tests for human TL. Herein we searched for these potential antigens in Leishmania species related to American Leishmaniasis (L. amazonensis, L. braziliensis and L. infantum). To this end, we employed an immunoproteomic approach using proteins from these Leishmania species and sera from TL and Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) patients.

We aimed to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction caused by Chagas' disease, with other etiologies, in the era of modern HF therapies. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 2552 Latin American patients randomized in the PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) and ATMOSPHERE (Aliskiren Trial to Minimize Outcomes in Patients With Heart Failure) trials. The investigator-reported etiology was categorized as Chagasic, other nonischemic, or ischemic cardiomyopathy. The outcomes of interest included the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization and its components and death from any cause. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were performed to compare outcomes by pathogenesis. There were 195 patients with Chagasic HF with reduced ejection fraction, 1300 with other nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and 1057 with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Compared with other etiologies, Chagasic patients were more often female, younger, and had lower prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and renal impairment (but had higher prevalence of stroke and pacemaker implantation) and had worse health-related quality of life. The rates of the composite outcome were 17.2, 12.5, and 11.4 per 100 person-years for Chagasic, other nonischemic, and ischemic patients, respectively-adjusted hazard ratio for Chagasic versus other nonischemic: 1.49 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.94; P=0.003) and Chagasic versus ischemic: 1.55 (1.18-2.04; P=0.002). The rates of allcause mortality were also higher.

We hypothesised that the sexual transmission of T. cruzi contributes to the ongoing spread of Chagas disease. OBJECTIVES A short-term longitudinal study was conducted to evaluate this hypothesis. METHODS The study population comprised 109 subjects from four families, among whom 21 had been diagnosed with acute Chagas disease by direct parasitological analysis. Blood mononuclear cells and serum samples were obtained from each study subject once per year for three consecutive years. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence serological examinations were used to detect specific T. cruzi antibodies. Polymerase chain reaction of T. cruzi DNA revealed 188-nucleotide bands, which hybridised to a specific radiolabelled probe and were confirmed by cloning and sequencing. RESULTS Three independent assessments at different time points revealed T. cruzi nuclear DNA footprints in 76% (83/109) of the study population with active infection. In contrast, the ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence assays detected the T. cruzi antibody in 28.4% (31/109) of the study samples. Moreover, the semen from 82.6% (19/23) of subjects people revealed harboured the 188-bp base pair T. cruzi footprint. Interestingly, the ejaculates of nuclear DNA-positive Chagas patient transmitted the T. cruzi upon peritoneal injection or infusion in the vagina of mice, and amastigotes were detected in the skeletal muscle, myocardium, vas deferens, and uterine tube. MAIN CONCLUSIONS T. cruzi infections can be transmitted from females or males to naïve mates through intercourse, and progeny showed discrepancies between the ratios of nuclear DNA footprints and specific antibody that can be explained by the tolerance attained during early embryo growth. Additional studies are needed to develop drugs to eradicate the infections. Additionally, the importance of a vigorous education, information, and communication program to prevent sexually transmitted Chagas disease in humans cannot be underemphasised. © 2017, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Facultad de Agronomia e Ingenieria Forestal.

From these, Rhodnius prolixus, Triatoma dimidiata, Triatoma infestans and Triatoma pallidipennis are important vectors distributed throughout the Latin American subcontinent. Resistance to pyrethroids has been developed by some triatomine populations, especially T. infestans, obstructing their control. Given their role in the regulation of physiological processes, neuroendocrine-derived factors have been proposed as a source of molecular targets for new-generation insecticides. However, the involvement of neuropeptides in insecticide metabolism and resistance in insects has been poorly studied. In the present work, the sequences of 20 neuropeptide precursor genes in T. infestans, 16 in T. dimidiata, and 13 in T. pallidipennis detected in transcriptomic databases are reported, and a comparative analysis in triatomines is presented. A total of 59 neuropeptides were validated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in brain and nervous ganglia from T. infestans, revealing the existence of differential post-translational modifications, extended and truncated forms. The results suggest a high sequence conservation in some neuropeptide systems in triatomines, whereas remarkable differences occur in several others within the core domains. Comparisons of the basal expression levels for several neuropeptide precursor genes between pyrethroid sensitive and resistant population of T. infestans are also presented here, in order to introduce a proof of concept to test the involvement of neuropeptides in insecticide resistance. From the precursors tested, NVP and ITG peptides are significantly higher expressed in the resistant population. To our knowledge, this is the first report to associate differential neuropeptide expression with insecticide resistance.

These parasites have highly distinct life cycles, pathologies, transmission strategies and surface proteomes, being dominated by the variant surface glycoprotein (African) or mucins (American) respectively. In African trypanosomes clathrin-mediated trafficking is responsible for endocytosis and post-Golgi transport, with several mechanistic aspects distinct from higher organisms.

There have been few studies on the physiopathology of the disease in oral transmission cases. Gastritis is a common ailment that can be caused by poor dietary habits, intake of alcohol or other gastric irritants, bacterial infection, or by the widespread use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This study investigated in a mouse model whether gastric mucosal injury, induced by aspirin, would affect the course of disease in animals infected with T. cruzi by the oral route. The CL14 and G strains of T. cruzi, both of low infectivity, were used. To this end, groups of BALB/c mice were treated during 5 days with aspirin (100 mg kg-1) before oral infection with T. cruzi metacyclic forms (4 × 105 or 5 × 107 parasites/mouse). Histological analysis and determination of nitric oxide and TNF-α were performed in gastric samples obtained 5 days after infection. Parasitemia was monitored from the thirteenth day after infection. The results indicate that aspirin treatment of mice injured their gastric mucosa and facilitated invasion by both CL14 and G strains of T. cruzi. Strain CL14 caused more severe infection compared to the G strain, as larger numbers of amastigote nests were found in the stomach and parasitemia levels were higher.

The treatment can yeld good clinical response, but serious side-effects from the drugs may ensue. More effective and better tolerated options are in need for treatment or prophylaxis."

Once known as an endemic health problem of poor rural populations in Latin American countries, it has now spread worldwide. The parasite is transmitted by triatomine bugs, of which Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera, Reduviidae, Triatominae) is one of the vectors and a model organism. This species occurs mainly in Central and South American countries where the disease is endemic. Disease prevention focuses on vector control programs that, in general, rely intensely on insecticide use. However, the massive use of chemical insecticides can lead to resistance. One of the major mechanisms is known as metabolic resistance that is associated with an increase in the expression or activity of detoxification genes. Three of the enzyme families that are involved in this process - carboxylesterases (CCE), glutathione s-transferases (GST) and cytochrome P450s (CYP) - are analyzed in the R. prolixus genome. A similar set of detoxification genes to those of the Hemipteran Acyrthosiphon pisum but smaller than in most dipteran species was found in R. prolixus genome. All major CCE classes (43 genes found) are present but the pheromone/hormone processing class had fewer genes than usual. One main expansion was detected on the detoxification/dietary class. The phosphotriesterase family, recently associated with insecticide resistance, was also represented with one gene. One microsomal GST gene was found and the cytosolic GST gene count (14 genes) is extremely low when compared to the other hemipteran species with sequenced genomes. However, this is similar to Apis mellifera, a species known for its deficit in detoxification genes. In R. prolixus 88 CYP genes were found, with representatives in the four clans (CYP2, CYP3, CYP4 and mitochondrial) usually found in insects. R. prolixus seems to have smaller species-specific expansions of CYP genes than mosquitoes and beetles, among others. The number of R. prolixus CYP genes is similar to the hemipteran Ac. pisum, although with a bigger expansion in CYP3 and CYP4 clans, along with several gene fragments, mostly in CYP4 clan. Eleven founding members of new families were detected, consisting of ten genes in the CYP3 clan and 1 gene in the CYP4 clan. Members of these clans were proposed to have important detoxification roles in insects. The identification of CCE, GST and CYP genes is of utmost importance for directing detoxification studies on triatomines that can help insecticide management strategies in control programs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

The parameters that can interfere the impedimetric response of the immunosensor response such as, concentration and incubation time in the solution of T. cruzi antigens, concentration of bovine serum albumin and incubation time in the solution of T. cruzi antibodies were optimized in the presence of the probe molecule hexacyanoferrate(II)/(III), using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The interaction between antigen–antibody was monitored using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the results were expressed in terms of the increase of the charge transfer resistance across the interface.

The diversity of bat trypanosomes globally is still poorly understood, and the common ancestor, geographical origin, and evolution of species within the T. cruzi clade remain largely unresolved. Methods: Trypanosome sequences were obtained from cultured parasites and from museum archived liver/blood samples of bats captured from Guatemala (Central America) to the Brazilian Atlantic Coast. Phylogenies were inferred using Small Subunit (SSU) rRNA, glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH), and Spliced Leader (SL) RNA genes. Results: Here, we described Trypanosoma wauwau n. sp. from Pteronotus bats (Mormoopidae) placed in the T. cruzi clade, then supporting the bat-seeding hypothesis whereby the common ancestor of this clade likely was a bat trypanosome. T. wauwau was sister to the clade T. spp-Neobats from phyllostomid bats forming an assemblage of trypanosome species exclusively of Noctilionoidea Neotropical bats, which was sister to an Australian clade of trypanosomes from indigenous marsupials and rodents, which possibly evolved from a bat trypanosome. T. wauwau was found in 26.5 % of the Pteronotus bats examined, and phylogeographical analysis evidenced the wide geographical range of this species. To date, this species was not detected in other bats, including those that were sympatric or shared shelters with Pteronotus. T. wauwau did not develop within mammalian cells, and was not infective to Balb/c mice or to triatomine vectors of T. cruzi and T. rangeli. Conclusions: Trypanosoma wauwau n. sp. was linked to Pteronotus bats. The positioning of the clade T. wauwau/T.spp-Neobats as the most basal Neotropical bat trypanosomes and closely related to an Australian lineage of trypanosomes provides additional evidence that the T. cruzi clade trypanosomes likely evolved from bats, and were dispersed in bats within and between continents from ancient to unexpectedly recent times. © 2015 Lima et al."

Materials/Methods: We used 370,539 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to examine the association between individual genomic proportions of African, European and Native American ancestry, and ethnoracial self-classification, with baseline and 10-year SRH trajectories in 1,311 community dwelling older Brazilians. We also examined whether genomic ancestry and ethnoracial self-classification affect the predictive value of SRH for subsequent mortality. Results: European ancestry predominated among participants, followed by African and Native American (median = 84.0%, 9.6% and 5.3%, respectively); the prevalence of Non-White (Mixed and Black) was 39.8%. Persons at higher levels of African and Native American genomic ancestry, and those self-identified as Non-White, were more likely to report poor health than other groups, even after controlling for socioeconomic conditions and an array of self-reported and objective physical health measures. Increased risks for mortality associated with worse SRH trajectories were strong and remarkably similar (hazard ratio ∼3) across all genomic ancestry and ethno-racial groups. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated for the first time that higher levels of African and Native American genomic ancestry- and the inverse for European ancestry-were strongly correlated with worse SRH in a Latin American admixed population.

Nevertheless, significant studies on the pathophysiology of this form of infection are largely lacking. The few studies investigating oral route infection disregard that inoculation in the oral cavity (Oral infection, OI) or by gavage (Gastrointestinal infection, GI) represent different infection routes, yet both show clear-cut parasitemia and heart parasitism during the acute infection. Herein, BALB/c mice were subjected to acute OI or GI infection using 5x104 culture-derived Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes. OI mice displayed higher parasitemia and mortality rates than their GI counterparts. Heart histopathology showed larger areas of infiltration in the GI mice, whereas liver lesions were more severe in the OI animals, accompanied by higher Alanine Transaminase and Aspartate Transaminase serum contents. A differential cytokine pattern was also observed because OI mice presented higher proinflammatory cytokine (IFN-γ, TNF) serum levels than GI animals. Real-time PCR confirmed a higher TNF, IFN-γ, as well as IL-10 expression in the cardiac tissue from the OI group compared with GI. Conversely, TGF-β and IL-17 serum levels were greater in the GI animals. Immunolabeling revealed macrophages as the main tissue source of TNF in infected mice. The high mortality rate observed in the OI mice paralleled the TNF serum rise, with its inhibition by an anti-TNF treatment. Moreover, differences in susceptibility between GI versus OI mice were more clearly related to the host response than to the effect of gastric pH on parasites, since infection in magnesium hydroxide-treated mice showed similar results. Overall, the present study provides conclusive evidence that the initial site of parasite entrance critically affects host immune response and disease outcome.

MSH2 is an early acting, central component of the Mismatch Repair (MMR) pathway, which is responsible for the recognition and correction of base mismatches that occur during DNA replication and recombination. In addition, recent evidence suggests that MSH2 might also play an important, but poorly understood, role in responding to oxidative damage in both African and American trypanosomes. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate the involvement of MMR in the oxidative stress response, null mutants of MSH2 were generated in Trypanosoma brucei procyclic forms and in Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigote forms. Unexpectedly, the MSH2 null mutants showed increased resistance to H2O2 exposure when compared with wild type cells, a phenotype distinct from the previously observed increased sensitivity of T. brucei bloodstream forms MSH2 mutants. Complementation studies indicated that the increased oxidative resistance of procyclic T. brucei was due to adaptation to MSH2 loss. In both parasites, loss of MSH2 was shown to result in increased tolerance to alkylation by MNNG and increased accumulation of 8-oxo-guanine in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, indicating impaired MMR. In T. cruzi, loss of MSH2 also increases the parasite capacity to survive within host macrophages. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these results indicate MSH2 displays conserved, dual roles in MMR and in the response to oxidative stress. Loss of the latter function results in life cycle dependent differences in phenotypic outcomes in T. brucei MSH2 mutants, most likely because of the greater burden of oxidative stress in the insect stage of the parasite. © 2015 Grazielle-Silva et al."

Different isoforms of CYP51 are present in all living organisms, since the products of its metabolic pathway, such as steroids, are of fundamental importance in the homeostasis while maintaining the integrity, fluidity and permeability of the cell membranes. In man, the main steroid in the cell membrane is cholesterol, unlike what occurs in fungi and some protozoa, which instead have ergosterol. Apart from infections caused by fungus, whose impact on public health has grown markedly, we highlight the hemoflagellated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (CD), or American trypanosomiasis. The progress achieved in recent decades in understanding the mechanism of action of antifungal azoles in clinical use as well as the knowledge about the structural differences between the isoforms of CYP51present in fungi and trypanosomatides allowed the design and synthesis of new molecules that are currently under clinical development for the treatment of CD. The drugs that act inhibiting the CYP51 may also bind to other oxidases such as aromatases responsible for the synthesis of hormones, as well as other cytochromes involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics. The toxic effects of new CYP51 inhibitors should be studied, in order to make possible the evaluation of the cost-effective use of molecules that act by this mechanism of action and that may become drugs for the treatment of infections caused by fungi and protozoa."

New therapeutic options are necessary for patients with chronic Chagas disease, a leading cause of heart failure in Latin American countries. Stem cell therapy focused on improving cardiac function is a promising approach for treating heart disease. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of cardiac mesenchymal stem cells (CMSCs) in a mouse model of chronic Chagas disease. Methods. CMSCs were isolated from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic C57BL/6 mouse hearts and tested for adipogenic, osteogenic, chondrogenic, endothelial, and cardiogenic differentiation potentials evaluated by histochemical and immunofluorescence techniques. A lymphoproliferation assay was performed to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of CMSCs. To investigate the therapeutic potential of CMSCs, C57BL/6 mice chronically infected with Trypanosoma cruzi were treated with 10 6 CMSCs or saline (control) by echocardiography-guided injection into the left ventricle wall. All animals were submitted to cardiac histopathological and immunofluorescence analysis in heart sections from chagasic mice. Analysis by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed in the heart to evaluate the expression of cytokines involved in the inflammatory response. Results: CMSCs demonstrated adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation potentials. Moreover, these cells expressed endothelial cell and cardiomyocyte features upon defined stimulation culture conditions and displayed immunosuppressive activity in vitro. After intramyocardial injection, GFP + CMSCs were observed in heart sections of chagasic mice one week later; however, no observed GFP+ cells co-expressed troponin T or connexin-43. Histopathological analysis revealed that CMSC-treated mice had a significantly decreased number of inflammatory cells, but no reduction in fibrotic area, two months after treatment. Analysis by qRT-PCR demonstrated that cell therapy significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression and increased transforming growth factor-beta in heart samples. Conclusions: We conclude that the CMSCs exert a protective effect in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy primarily through immunomodulation. © 2014 Silva et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

The limited availability of rapid serological diagnostic tests hinders rapid diagnosis and early treatment in areas of endemicity and nonendemicity. In collaboration with 11 national reference laboratories (NRLs) from different geographical areas, we evaluated the performances of commercialized serological rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for T. cruzi infection. Eleven commercialized T. cruzi infection RDTs were evaluated on a total of 474 samples extensively tested with at least three different techniques for Chagas disease, maintained at controlled low temperatures, and stored in the serum banks of the 11 NRLs. We measured the sensitivity, specificity, and concordance of each RDT and provided an additional questionnaire to evaluate its ease of use. The selected RDTs in this study were performed under controlled laboratory conditions. Out of the 11 RDTs, we found 8 of them to be useful, with the cassette format favored over the strip. We did not observe significant differences in RDT performances in the different regions. Overall, the performance results were lower than those disclosed by the manufacturers. The results of this evaluation validate the possibility of using RDTs to diagnose Chagas disease, thereby decreasing the time to treatment at a primary health care facility for patients who are willing to be treated.

Trypanosomatids lack these typical repeats and display an unusual transcription control. RNAPol II associates with the transcription site of the spliced leader (SL) RNA, which is used in the trans-splicing of all mRNAs transcribed on long polycistronic units. We found that Trypanosoma cruzi RNA Pol II associated with chromatin is highly phosphorylated. When transcription is inhibited by actinomycin D, the enzyme runs off from SL genes, remaining hyperphosphorylated and associated with polycistronic transcription units. Upon heat shock, the enzyme is dephosphorylated and remains associated with the chromatin. Transcription is partially inhibited with the accumulation of housekeeping precursor mRNAs, except for heat shock genes. DNA damage caused dephosphorylation and transcription arrest, with RNA Pol II dissociating from chromatin although staying at the SL. In the presence of calyculin A, the hyperphosphorylated form detached from chromatin, including the SL loci. These results indicate that in trypanosomes, the unusual RNA Pol II is phosphorylated during the transcription of SL and polycistronic operons.

Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and is mainly prevalent in Latin America but is increasingly occurring in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Sleeping sickness or human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), caused by two sub-species of Trypanosoma brucei (i.e., T . b . rhodesiense and T. b . gambiense ), occurs only in sub-Saharan Africa countries. These pathogenic trypanosomatids alternate between invertebrate and vertebrate hosts throughout their lifecycles, and different developmental stages can live inside the host cells and circulate in the bloodstream or in the insect gut. Trypanosomatids have a classical eukaryotic ultrastructural organization with some of the same main organelles found in mammalian host cells, while also containing special structures and organelles that are absent in other eukaryotic organisms. For example, the mitochondrion is ramifi ed and contains a region known as the kinetoplast, which houses the mitochondrial DNA. Also, the glycosomes are specialized peroxisomes containing glycolytic pathway enzymes. Moreover, a layer of subpellicular microtubules confers mechanic rigidity to the cell. Some of these structures have been investigated to determine their function and identify potential enzymes and metabolic pathways that may constitute targets for new chemotherapeutic drugs. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014."

They are referred to as neglected diseases, because of a lack of interest on the part of the pharmaceutical industry. Today, chemotherapy is the only specific treatment against these diseases, the most frequently used drugs being nifurtimox and benznidazole. The aim of this study was to assess the antiparasitic and cytotoxic activity of the crude ethanolic leaf extract of Piper arboreum and its fractions against strains of Leishmania brasiliensis and Trypanosoma cruzi. After preparing the crude ethanolic extract and fractions, in vitro tests were performed to assay antiparasitic activity against T. cruzi, using the epimastigote clone CL-B5, while against L. brasiliensis, promastigote forms were used. The cytotoxicity assay was performed with a fibroblast cell line, NCTC 929. The results indicate that the samples possessed high toxicity, except for the ethyl acetate fraction. The results for antiparasitic activity showed highest activity in the hexane fraction, which was lethal to 62% and 51% of the epimastigotes and 100% and 92% of the promastigotes, at 500 and 100μg/ mL, respectively. From these results, it is concluded that P. arboreum can be considered an alternative source of natural products with activity against T. cruzi and L. brasiliensis."

In animals with the Y strain treated 24 h after infection for 10 days, only mice treated by LYC-PCL NC were cured, but animals treated in the prepatent period for 20 days exhibited 100, 75, and 62.5% cure when treated with LYC-PLA-PEG NC, benznidazole, and LYC-PCL NC, respectively. Free LYC reduced the parasitemia and improved mice survival, but no mice were cured. LYC-loaded NC showed higher cure rates, reduced parasitemia, and increased survival when used in doses 2five times lower than those used for benznidazole. This study confirms that LYC is a potential new treatment for Chagas disease.

Methods Patients with Chagas disease with the indeterminate (n = 69) or with the cardiac form (32 with changes limited to electrocardiography [stage A], 25 with changes in LV systolic function but no heart failure [HF; stage B], and 26 with HF) underwent evaluation of LV diastolic function (mitral inflow, pulmonary vein flow, color M-mode echocardiography, and tissue Doppler analysis), and LA function by three-dimensional echocardiography and strain analysis and were prospectively followed for the occurrence of clinical events. Echocardiograms were also obtained from 32 controls. Results LV diastolic dysfunction was gradually more prevalent and severe across groups from patients with the indeterminate form of Chagas disease to patients with HF. Tissue Doppler was the best tool to demonstrate the worsening of LV diastolic function across the groups (E′ velocity: controls, 12.6 ± 2.3 cm/sec; patients with the indeterminate form, 12.1 ± 3.1 cm/sec; stage A, 10.3 ± 2.9 cm/sec; stage B, 8.3 ± 2.8 cm/sec; patients with HF, 5.6 ± 1.9; P &lt;.0001).

LA conductive function was depressed in all cardiac form groups, while LA contractile function was depressed only in patients with HF. Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis revealed that end-systolic LV diameter (hazard ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-2.8; P =.09), E′ velocity (hazard ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.8; P =.001), and peak negative global LA strain (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.4; P =.03), were independent predictors of clinical events. Conclusions LV diastolic dysfunction was found in all forms of chronic Chagas disease, including those without LV systolic dysfunction.

In vitro data showed that cynaropicrin was more effective than psilostachyin A. Ultrastructural alterations induced by cynaropicrin included shedding events, detachment of large portions of the plasma membrane, and vesicular bodies and large vacuoles containing membranous structures, suggestive of parasite autophagy. Acute toxicity studies showed that one of two mice died at a cynaropicrin dose of 400 mg/kg of body weight given intraperitoneally (i.p.). Although no major plasma biochemical alterations could be detected, histopathology demonstrated that the liver was the most affected organ in cynaropicrin-treated animals. Although cynaropicrin was as effective as benznidazole against trypomastigotes in vitro, the treatment (once or twice a day) of T. cruzi-infected mice (up to 50 mg/kg/day cynaropicrin) did not suppress parasitemia or protect against mortality induced by the Y and Colombiana strains. Psilostachyin A (0.5 to 50 mg/kg/day given once a day) was not effective in the acute model of T. cruzi infection (Y strain), reaching 100% animal mortality.

In the present study, a fraction enriched in tight-binding protease inhibitors was isolated from the Caribbean coral Plexaura homomalla (Esper, 1792), functionally characterized and tested for their antiparasitic activity against Trypanosoma cruzi and Plasmodium falciparum. The resultant fraction was chromatographically enriched in tight-binding inhibitors active against Papain-like cysteine peptidases (92%) and Pepsin-like aspartyl peptidases (8%). Globally, the inhibitors present in the enriched fraction showed no competition with substrates and apparent Ki values of 1.99 and 4.81nM for Falcipain 2 and Cruzipain, the major cysteine peptidases from P. falciparum and T. cruzi, respectively. The inhibitor-enriched fraction showed promising antiparasitic activity in cultures. It reduced the growth of the chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strain Dd2 (IC50=0.46μM) and promoted the apparent accumulation of trophozoites, both consistent with a blockade in the hemoglobin degradation pathway. At sub-micromolar concentrations, the inhibitor-enriched fraction reduced the infection of VERO cells by T. cruzi (CL Brener clone) trypomastigotes and interfered with intracellular differentiation and/or replication of the parasites. This study provides new scientific evidence that confirms P. homomalla as an excellent source of tight-biding protease inhibitors for different proteases with biomedical relevance, and suggests that either the individual inhibitors or the enriched fraction itself could be valuable as antiparasitic compounds. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."

In this study, we evaluated the involvement of inflammasomes in T. cruzi infection and demonstrated that apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) inflammasomes, including NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), but not NLR family, caspase recruitment domain-containing 4 or NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 6, are required for triggering the activation of caspase-1 and the secretion of IL-1b. The mechanism by which T. cruzi mediates the activation of the ASC/NLRP3 pathway involves K+ efflux, lysosomal acidification, reactive oxygen species generation, and lysosomal damage. We also demonstrate that despite normal IFN-γ production in the heart, ASC-/- and caspase-1 -/- infected mice exhibit a higher incidence of mortality, cardiac parasitism, and heart inflammation. These data suggest that ASC inflammasomes are critical determinants of host resistance to infection with T. cruzi. Copyright © 2013 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc."

Two currently available drugs exhibit severe toxicity and low effectiveness, especially in the chronic phase, while new drug discovery has been halted for years as a result of a lack of interest from pharmaceutical companies. Although attempts to repurpose the antifungal drugs posaconazole and ravuconazole (inhibitors of fungal sterol 14-demethylase [CYP51]) are finally in progress, development of cheaper and more efficient, preferably Trypanosoma cruzi-specific, chemotherapies would be highly advantageous. Wehave recently reported that the experimental T. cruzi CYP51 inhibitor VNI cures with 100% survival and 100% parasitological clearance both acute and chronic murine infections with the Tulahuen strain of T. cruzi. In this work, we further explored the potential of VNI by assaying nitro-derivative-resistant T. cruzi strains, Y and Colombiana, in highly stringent protocols of acute infection. The data show high antiparasitic efficacy of VNI and its derivative (VNI/VNF) against both forms of T. cruzi that are relevant for mammalian host infection (bloodstream and amastigotes), with the in vivo potency, at 25 mg/kg twice a day (b.i.d.), similar to that of benznidazole (100 mg/kg/day). Transmission electron microscopy and reverse mutation tests were performed to explore cellular ultrastructural and mutagenic aspects of VNI, respectively. No mutagenic potential could be seen by the Ames test at up to 3.5-M, and the main ultrastructural damage induced by VNI in T. cruzi was related to Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum organization, with membrane blebs presenting an autophagic phenotype. Thus, these preliminary studies confirm VNI as a very promising trypanocidal drug candidate for Chagas disease therapy. Copyright © 2013, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved."

Methods. Trypanosomes from bats (Rhinolophus landeri and Hipposideros caffer) captured in Mozambique, southeast Africa, were isolated by hemoculture. Barcoding was carried out through the V7V8 region of Small Subunit (SSU) rRNA and Fluorescent Fragment Length barcoding (FFLB). Phylogenetic inferences were based on SSU rRNA, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) and Spliced Leader (SL) genes. Morphological characterization included light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Results: New trypanosomes from bats clustered together forming a clade basal to a larger assemblage called the T. cruzi clade. Barcoding, phylogenetic analyses and genetic distances based on SSU rRNA and gGAPDH supported these trypanosomes as a new species, which we named Trypanosoma livingstonei n. sp. The large and highly polymorphic SL gene repeats of this species showed a copy of the 5S ribosomal RNA into the intergenic region. Unique morphological (large and broad blood trypomastigotes compatible to species of the subgenus Megatrypanum and cultures showing highly pleomorphic epimastigotes and long and slender trypomastigotes) and ultrastructural (cytostome and reservosomes) features and growth behaviour (when co-cultivated with HeLa cells at 37°C differentiated into trypomastigotes resembling the blood forms and do not invaded the cells) complemented the description of this species. Conclusion: Phylogenetic inferences supported the hypothesis that Trypanosoma livingstonei n. sp. diverged from a common ancestral bat trypanosome that evolved exclusively in Chiroptera or switched at independent opportunities to mammals of several orders forming the clade T. cruzi, hence, providing further support for the bat seeding hypothesis to explain the origin of T. cruzi and T. rangeli. © 2013 Lima et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Quantitative real time PCR assays (qPCR) for the detection of L.

Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic mycosis in Latin America that can affect various organs. Few case reports of paracoccidioidomycosis affecting the prostate are found in the literature. Case presentation. We present the case of a 79-year-old Caucasian man with a six-month history of irritative symptoms of the prostate (urgency, frequency and nocturia) and difficulty initiating urination that progressed to urinary retention and the use of a urinary catheter. The anatomopathological analysis of the transurethral resection of the prostate revealed chronic granulomatous prostatitis of fungal etiology (paracoccidioidomycosis) with extensive necrosis. The patient began treatment with itraconazole at a dose of 100mg/day for six months. Radiography of the thorax revealed bilaterally diffuse nodular reticular interstitial lesions. The patient progressed to respiratory failure and was sent to the intensive care unit, but suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest and was pronounced dead. Conclusions: Due to the high incidence of paracoccidioidomycosis in countries like Brazil, urologists should suspect blastomycosis in all patients with symptoms of lower urinary obstruction with chronic abacterial prostatitis. Considering that paracoccidioidomycosis has the potential to affect various organs, following diagnosis, the treatment must be initiated as soon as possible. © 2013 de Arruda et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

To identify components involved in the protozoan-vector relationship, we constructed and analyzed cDNA libraries from RNA isolated from the midguts of uninfected and T. cruzi-infected Triatoma infestans, which are major vectors of Chagas disease. We generated approximately 440 high-quality Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from each T. infestans midgut cDNA library. The sequences were grouped in 380 clusters, representing an average length of 664.78 base pairs (bp). Many clusters were not classified functionally, representing unknown transcripts. Several transcripts involved in different processes (e.g., detoxification) showed differential expression in response to T. cruzi infection. Lysozyme, cathepsin D, a nitrophorin-like protein and a putative 14 kDa protein were significantly upregulated upon infection, whereas thioredoxin reductase was downregulated. In addition, we identified several transcripts related to metabolic processes or immunity with unchanged expressions, including infestin, lipocalins and defensins. We also detected ESTs encoding juvenile hormone binding protein (JHBP), which seems to be involved in insect development and could be a target in control strategies for the vector.

Recently, it has been shown that lymphocytes have an action modulating the early phase of inflammatory response. In this article, we analyze the role of B1 in the inflammatory response of different origins and finally focus attention on sepsis. B lymphocyte deficiency has been linked to acute infection presumably owing to the lack of an adaptive immune response to effectively clear pathogens. Individuals with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) present B1 lymphocyte deficiency caused by mutations in the Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk). Some data show that B1 cells might contribute to susceptibility in experimental paracoccidioidomycosis. On the other hand, B1 cells are shown to be detrimental in other mouse models of microbial infection, such as experimental Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and Staphylococcus aureus-induced arthritis.

We show that cyclophilin, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase secreted from T. cruzi epimastigotes, binds to and neutralizes the reduviid antimicrobial peptide trialysin promoting parasite survival. This is dependent on a singular proline residue in trialysin and is inhibited by the cyclophilin inhibitor cyclosporine A. In addition, cyclophilin-trialysin complexes enhance the production of ATP and reductase responses of parasites, which are inhibited by both calcineurin-specific inhibitors cyclosporine A and FK506. Calcineurin phosphatase activity of cyclophilin-trialysin- treated parasites was higher than in controls and was inhibited by preincubation by either inhibitor. Parasites exposed to cyclophilin-trialysin have enhanced binding and invasion of host cells leading to higher infectivity. Leishmanial cyclophilin also mediates trialysin protection and metabolic stimulation by T. cruzi, indicating that extracellular cyclophilin may be critical to adaptation in other insect-borne protozoa.

Efforts to develop a therapeutic vaccine that boosts the immune response to completely clear the parasite are needed because there is no effective treatment for chronically infected patients. In an attempt to modify the host-parasite equilibrium to increase parasite destruction, we analyzed cardiopathy and the immune response in chronically infected mice that were challenged with live homologous parasites. Challenge with a single dose of parasite increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations, gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production, and serum-specific IgG levels. However, subpatent parasitemias and cardiac tissue were not affected. Because of the short duration of the immune boost after a single challenge, we next evaluated the impact of four parasite doses, administered 3 weeks apart. At 1 to 2 months after the last dose, the numbers of CD4 + T cells and IFN-γ-producing CD4+ memory cells and the CD4+ T cell proliferative response to T. cruzi antigen were increased in the spleen. The frequency of IFN-γ-producing CD8+ memory cells in the blood was also increased. However, the sustained challenge did not favor TH1 development; rather, it induced an increase in serum-specific IgG1 levels and mixed TH1/TH2 cytokine production. Moreover, there were no significant changes in cardiac lesions and subpatent parasitemias.

Parasite conditioned culture supernatant was fractionated and characterized by morphological, immunochemical, and proteomic analyses. Three fractions were obtained by differential ultracentrifugation: the first enriched in larger vesicles resembling ectosomes, the second enriched in smaller vesicles resembling exosomes, and a third fraction enriched in soluble proteins not associated with extracellular vesicles. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis revealed a rich collection of proteins involved in metabolism, signaling, nucleic acid binding, and parasite survival and virulence.

Previous data presented that the regeneration tax in the ENS neurons is augmented in chagasic patients. Although, there are several neuronal types with different functions in the intestine a detailed study about the regeneration of every neuronal type was never performed before. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the regeneration tax of every neuronal cell type in the ENS from chagasic patients with megacolon and non-infected individuals.

Heart failure and etiologies associated with heart failure may be responsible for 6.3% of causes of deaths. Rheumatic fever is the leading cause of valvular heart disease. However, a tendency to reduction of HF mortality due to Chagas heart disease from 1985 to 2006, and reduction in mortality due to HF from 1999 to 2005 were observed in selected states in Brazil. The findings have important public health implications because the allocation of health care resources, and strategies to reduce risk of heart failure should also consider the control of neglected Chagas disease and rheumatic fever in South American countries. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers."

Mice chronically infected with T. cruzi were treated with human recombinant G-CSF (3 courses of 200 g/kg/d for 5 d). Inflammation and fibrosis were reduced in the hearts of G-CSFtreated mice, compared with the hearts of vehicle-treated mice, which correlated with decreased syndecan-4, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and galectin-3 expressions. Marked reductions in interferon and tumor necrosis factor and increased interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor- were found after G-CSF administration. Because the therapy did not induce a Th1 to Th2 immune response deviation, we investigated the role of regulatory T (Treg) cells. A significant increase in CD3Foxp3 cells was observed in the hearts of GCSF- treated mice. In addition, a reduction of parasitism was observed after G-CSF treatment.

The purpose of this work was to study the chemical conversion of NFOH into NF in sodium acetate buffer (pH 1.2 and 7.4) and in human plasma and to determine preclinical pharmacokinetic parameters in rats. At pH 1.2, the NFOH was totally transformed into NF, the parent drug, after 48 h, while at pH 7.4, after the same period, the hydrolysis rate was 20%. In human plasma, 50% of NFOH was hydrolyzed after 24 h. In the investigation of kinetic disposition, the concentration of drug in serum versus time curve was used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters after a single-dose regimen. NFOH showed a time to maximum concentration of drug in serum (Tmax) as 1 h, suggesting faster absorption than NF (4 h). The most important results observed were the volume of distribution (V) of NFOH through the tissues, which showed a rate that is 20-fold higher (337.5 liters/kg of body weight) than that of NF (17.64 liters/kg), and the concentration of NF obtained by in vivo metabolism of NFOH, which was about four times lower (maximum concentration of drug in serum [Cmax]=0.83 μg/ml; area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12]=5.683 μg/ml · h) than observed for administered NF (Cmax=2.78 μg/ml; AUC0-12=54.49 μg/ml · h). These findings can explain the superior activity and lower toxicity of the prodrug NFOH in relation to its parent drug and confirm NFOH as a promising anti-Chagas' disease drug candidate.

Despite its great social impact, there is no direct evidence in the literature explaining the development of heart failure in Chagas' disease. Therefore, the main objective of the study was to investigate the development of the Chagas' disease towards its chronic phase and correlate with modifications in the cellular electrophysiological characteristics of the infected heart. Methods and results: Using a murine model of Chagas' disease, we confirmed and extended previous findings of altered electrocardiogram and echocardiogram in this cardiomyopathy. The observed changes in the electrocardiogram were correlated with the prolonged action potential and reduced transient outward potassium current density. Reduced heart function was associated with remodeling of intracellular calcium handling, altered extracellular matrix content, and to a set of proteins involved in the control of cellular contractility in ventricular myocytes. Furthermore, disruption of calcium homeostasis was partially due to activation of the PI3Kinase/nitric oxide signaling pathway. Finally, we propose a causal link between the inflammatory mediators and heart remodeling during chagasic cardiomyopathy. Conclusion: Altogether our results demonstrate that heart failure in Chagas' disease may occur due to electrical and mechanical remodeling of cardiac myocytes, and suggest that AKT/PI3K/NO axis could be an important pharmacological target to improve the disease outcome. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

SDs and physical mixtures (PMs) in different drug/carrier ratios were characterized and compared using differential scanning calorimetry, hot stage microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), particle size, water solubility values, and dissolution profiles. Moreover, LLC-MK2 fibroblast cytotoxicity and trypanocidal activity evaluation were performed to determine the potential of SD as a strategy to improve UA efficacy against Chagas disease.

Although ChHD is a common form of cardiomyopathy in Latin American ICD users, little is known about its efficacy in the treatment of this population. The study cohort included 116 consecutive patients with ChHD and an ICD implanted for secondary prevention. Of the 116 patients, 83 (72%) were men; the mean age was 54 ± 10.7 years. Several clinical variables were tested in a multivariate Cox model for predicting long-term mortality. The average follow-up was 45 ± 32 months. New York Heart Association class I-II developed in 83% of patients. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 42 ± 16% at implantation. Of the 116 patients, 58 (50%) had appropriate shocks and 13 (11%) had inappropriate therapy. A total of 31 patients died (7.1% annual mortality rate). New York Heart Association class III (hazard ratio [HR] 3.09, 95% confidence interval 1.37 to 6.96, p = 0.0064) was a predictor of a worse prognosis.

Inhibitors of the trypanosome sterol 14α-demethylase enzyme (CYP51), including azole antifungal drugs, are promising candidates for development as anti-Chagas disease drugs. Posaconazole is under clinical investigation for Chagas disease, although the high cost of this drug may limit its widespread use. We have previously reported that the human protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) inhibitor tipifarnib has potent anti-T. cruzi activity by inhibiting the CYP51 enzyme. Furthermore, we have developed analogs that minimize the PFT-inhibitory activity and enhance the CYP51 inhibition. In this paper, we describe the efficacy of the lead tipifarnib analog compared to that of posaconazole in a murine model of T. cruzi infection. The plasma exposure profiles for each compound following a single oral dose in mice and estimated exposure parameters after repeated twice-daily dosing for 20 days are also presented. The lead tipifarnib analog had potent suppressive activity on parasitemia in mice but was unsuccessful at curing mice, whereas posaconazole as well as benznidazole cured 3 of 5 and 4 of 6 mice, respectively. The efficacy results are consistent with posaconazole having substantially higher predicted exposure than that of the tipifarnib analog after repeat twice-daily administration. Further changes to the tipifarnib analogs to reduce plasma clearance are therefore likely to be important. A crystal structure of a trypanosomal CYP51 bound to a tipifarnib analog is reported here and provides new insights to guide structure-based drug design for further optimized compounds.

An apparent segregation among these triatomine species inside human households was suggested to rely on mutual repellence between them. However, P. megistus and T. infestans show aggregation responses to chemical signals emitted by the other species. These findings do not rule out the possibility that stimuli other than chemical signals could mediate repellence when these species exploit shelters simultaneously. In the present study, we investigated how P. megistus and T. infestans exploit shelters in controlled laboratory conditions and how insect density and environmental illumination modulate this behavior. We evaluated whether these species aggregate inside shelters or mutually repel each other. Panstrongylus megistus and T. infestans show specific patterns of shelter exploitation, which are differentially affected by insect density and environment illumination. In particular, P. megistus is more sensitive to insect density than T. infestans, whereas T. infestans shows higher sensitivity to illumination than P. megistus. Nevertheless, these species exploit shelters randomly without any apparent repellence. Copyright © 2012 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene."

Suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2) is a regulator of immune responses and may therefore participate in the pathogenesis of T. cruzi infection. SOCS2 is expressed during T. cruzi infection, and its expression is partially reduced in infected 5-lipoxygenase-deficient [knockout (KO)] mice. In SOCS2 KO mice, there was a reduction in both parasitemia and the expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-6, IL-10, SOCS1, and SOCS3 in the spleen. Expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, SOCS1, and SOCS3 was also reduced in the hearts of infected SOCS2 KO mice. There was an increase in the generation and expansion of T regulatory (Treg) cells and a decrease in the number of memory cells in T. cruzi-infected SOCS2 KO mice. Levels of lipoxinA 4 (LXA 4) increased in these mice. Echocardiography studies demonstrated an impairment of cardiac function in T. cruzi-infected SOCS2 KO mice. There were also changes in calcium handling and in action potential waveforms, and reduced outward potassium currents in isolated cardiac myocytes. Our data suggest that reductions of inflammation and parasitemia in infected SOCS2-deficient mice may be secondary to the increases in Treg cells and LXA 4 levels. This occurs at the cost of greater infection-associated heart dysfunction, highlighting the relevance of balanced inflammatory and immune responses in preventing severe T. cruzi-induced disease.

Methods and Results-Patients 18 to 75 years of age with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association class II to IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <35, and optimized therapy were randomized to intracoronary injection of autologous BMNCs or placebo. The primary end point was the difference in LVEF from baseline to 6 and 12 months after treatment between groups. Analysis was by intention to treat and powered to detect an absolute between-group difference of 5. Between July 2005 and October 2009, 234 patients were enrolled. Two patients abandoned the study and 49 were excluded because of protocol violation. The remaining 183 patients, 93 in the placebo group and 90 in the BMNC group, had a trimmed mean age of 52.4 years (range, 50.8-54.0 years) and LVEF of 26.1 (range, 25.1-27.1) at baseline. Median number of injected BMNCs was 2.20×10 (range, 1.40-3.50×10). Change in LVEF did not differ significantly between treatment groups: trimmed mean change in LVEF at 6 months, 3.0 (1.3-4.8) for BMNCs and 2.5 (0.6-4.5) for placebo (P=0.519); change in LVEF at 12 months, 3.5 (1.5-5.5) for BMNCs and 3.7 (1.5-6.0) for placebo (P=0.850). Left ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes, New York Heart Association functional class, Minnesota quality-of-life questionnaire, brain natriuretic peptide concentrations, and 6-minute walking test did also not differ between groups. Conclusion-Intracoronary injection of autologous BMNCs does not improve left ventricular function or quality of life in patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy.

Even though insecticide treatments allow effective control of these bugs in most Latin American countries where Chagas disease is endemic, the disease still affects a large proportion of the population of South America. The features of the disease in humans have been extensively studied, and the genome of the parasite has been sequenced, but no effective drug is yet available to treat Chagas disease. The digestive tract of the insect vectors in which T. cruzi develops has been much less well investigated than blood from its human hosts and constitutes a dynamic environment with very different conditions. Thus, we investigated the composition of the predominant bacterial species of the microbiota in insect vectors from Rhodnius, Triatoma, Panstrongylus and Dipetalogaster genera. Methodology/Principal Findings: Microbiota of triatomine guts were investigated using cultivation-independent methods, i.e., phylogenetic analysis of 16s rDNA using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and cloned-based sequencing. The Chao index showed that the diversity of bacterial species in triatomine guts is low, comprising fewer than 20 predominant species, and that these species vary between insect species. The analyses showed that Serratia predominates in Rhodnius, Arsenophonus predominates in Triatoma and Panstrongylus, while Candidatus Rohrkolberia predominates in Dipetalogaster. Conclusions/Significance: The microbiota of triatomine guts represents one of the factors that may interfere with T. cruzi transmission and virulence in humans. The knowledge of its composition according to insect species is important for designing measures of biological control for T. cruzi. We found that the predominant species of the bacterial microbiota in triatomines form a group of low complexity whose structure differs according to the vector genus. © 2012 da Mota et al."

In this study, we present evidence for a novel immune evasion mechanism of Trypanosoma cruzi, mediated by host cell plasma membrane-derived vesicles. We found that T. cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes induced microvesicle release from blood cells early in infection. Upon their release, microvesicles formed a complex on the T. cruzi surface with the complement C3 convertase, leading to its stabilization and inhibition, and ultimately resulting in increased parasite survival. Furthermore, we found that TGF-β-bearing microvesicles released from monocytes and lymphocytes promoted rapid cell invasion by T. cruzi, which also contributed to parasites escaping the complement attack. In addition, in vivo infection with T. cruzi showed a rapid increase of microvesicle levels in mouse plasma, and infection with exogenous microvesicles resulted in increased T. cruzi parasitemia. Altogether, these data support a role for microvesicles contributing to T. cruzi evasion of innate immunity. Copyright © 2012 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc."

Here, we have adapted a 1D nanoHPLC system to perform online 2D LC-MS/MS, using the autosampler to inject the eluting salt solutions in the first dimension separation. The application of this methodology for the proteomic analysis of the infective trypomastigote stage of T. cruzi led to the identification of 1448 nonredundant proteins.

In this work, we describe the biochemical and global gene expression changes of epimastigotes under hyperosmotic conditions. Hyperosmotic stress resulted in cell shrinking within a few minutes. Depending on the medium osmolarity, this was followed by lack of volume recovery for at least 2 h or by slow recovery. Experiments with inhibitors, or with cells in which an aquaporin gene (TcAQP1) was knocked down or overexpressed, revealed its importance for the cellular response to hyperosmotic stress. Furthermore, the adaptation to this new environment was shown to involve the regulation of the polyphosphate polymerization state as well as changes in amino acid catabolism to generate compatible osmolytes. A genome-wide transcriptional analysis of stressed parasites revealed down-regulation of genes belonging to diverse functional categories and up-regulation of genes encoding trans-sialidase-like and ribosomal proteins. Several of these changes were confirmed by Northern blot analyses.

Stroke, mainly cardioembolic, may occur in the chronic phase, but other stroke etiologies are reported. Embolic sources and inflammation are thought to play a role in stroke mechanisms. Specific treatment for Chagas disease is scarce and preventive measures are needed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."

Forty-nine (26%) patients were found to have anemia; 37 (20%) were men and 12 (6%) were women. Mean hemoglobin level was 14.1. ±. 1.2. g/L in patients with no anemia and 11.5. ±. 1.2. g/L in patients with anemia.On a Cox proportional hazards multivariate analysis, anemia was a predictor of all-cause mortality neither in the univariate nor in the multivariate analysis. Mean serum sodium (Hazard ratio. = 0.92; Beta-coefficient. = -0.09; 95% confidence interval 0.89-0.96; p value. <. 0.005), and Beta-Blocker therapy (Hazard ratio. = 0.40; 95% confidence interval 0.26-0.61; p value. <. 0.005) were retained as independent predictors of mortality for patients with Chagas' cardiomyopathy with chronic heart failure. Probability of survival for patients with anemia, however, was significantly lower in patients with anemia in comparison to patients with no anemia, mainly in patients with advanced heart failure.

Lately, it has also become a health concern in the United States and Europe. Currently, a diagnosis of Chagas' disease and the screening of blood supplies for antiparasite antibodies are achieved by conventional serological tests that show substantial variation in the reproducibility and reliability of their results. In addition, the specificity of these assays is curtailed by antigenic crossreactivity with sera from patients affected by other endemic diseases, such as leishmaniasis. Here we used a highly sensitive chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CL-ELISA) to evaluate a recombinant protein core of a mucin-like molecule (termed trypomastigote small surface antigen [TSSA]) for the detection of specific serum antibodies in a broad panel of human sera. The same samples were evaluated by CL-ELISA using as the antigen either a mixture of native T. cruzi trypomastigote mucins or an epimastigote extract and, for further comparison, by conventional serologic tests, such as an indirect hemagglutination assay and indirect immunofluorescence assay. TSSA showed ∼87% sensitivity among the seropositive Chagasic panel, a value which was increased up to >98% when only parasitologically positive samples were considered. More importantly, TSSA showed a significant increase in specificity (97.4%) compared to those of currently used assays, which averaged 80 to 90%. Overall, our data demonstrate that recombinant TSSA may be a useful antigen for the immunodiagnosis of Chagas' disease. Copyright © 2011, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved."

Four diamidines (DB75, DB569, DB1345, and DB829), eight arylimidamides (DB766, DB749, DB889, DB709, DB613, DB1831, DB1852, and DB2002), and one guanylhydrazone (DB1080) were assayed in thermal denaturation (T m) and circular dichroism (CD) studies using whole purified T. cruzi kDNA and a conserved synthetic parasite sequence. The overall CD spectra using the whole kDNA were similar to those found for the conserved sequence and were indicative of minor groove binding. Our findings showed that some of the compounds that exhibited the highest trypanocidal activities (e.g., DB766) caused low or no change in the T m measurements. However, while some active compounds, such as DB766, induced profound alterations of kDNA topology, others, like DB1831, although effective, did not result in altered T m and CD measurements. Our data suggest that the strong affinity of amidines with kDNA per se is not sufficient to generate and trigger their trypanocidal activity.

The enhanced parasitemia and mortality in 3d animals were associated with impaired proinflammatory response, including reduced levels of IL-12p40 and IFN-γ. Importantly, the phenotype of 3d mice was intermediary between MyD88-/- (highly susceptible) and TLR9-/- (moderately susceptible), indicating the involvement of an additional UN93B1-dependent TLR(s) on host resistance to T. cruzi. Hence, our experiments also revealed that TLR7 is a critical innate immune receptor involved in recognition of parasite RNA, induction of IL-12p40 by dendritic cells, and consequent IFN-γ by T lymphocytes.

Although the vector and transfusion-derived transmission of the disease has been controlled in many countries, there remains a pressing need for sustained surveillance of the measures that led to this achievement. It is also necessary to adopt initiatives that enable appropriate management of social and medical conditions resulting from the migration of infected individuals to countries where the disease formerly did not exist. It ́s also necessary to standardize the most reliable methods of detection of infection with T. cruzi, not only for diagnosis purposes, but more crucially, as a cure criterion. The etiological treatment of millions of patients in the chronic stage of the disease is also to be unraveled. A renewed interest in this area is observed, including prospects of studies focusing on the association of drugs with benznidazole. We also wait for full evidence of the actual effectiveness of the etiological treatment to impact favorably on the natural history of the disease in its chronic phase.

Protective adaptive immunity depends on balanced signaling through a T cell receptor and coreceptors expressed on the T cell surface. Such coreceptors can trigger stimulatory or inhibitory signals after binding to their ligands in antigen-presenting cells (APC). T. cruzi modulates the expression of coreceptors in lymphocytes after infection. Deregulated inflammation may be due to unbalanced expression of these molecules. Programmed death cell receptor 1 (PD-1) is a negative T cell coreceptor that has been associated with T cell anergy or exhaustion and persistent intracellular infections. We aimed to study the role of PD-1 during T. cruzi-induced acute myocarditis in mice. Cytometry assays showed that PD-1 and its ligands are strongly upregulated in lymphocytes and APC in response to T. cruzi infection in vivo and in vitro. Lymphocytes infiltrating the myocardium exhibited high levels of expression of these molecules. An increased cardiac inflammatory response was found in mice treated with blocking antibodies against PD-1, PD-L1, and to a lesser extent, PD-L2, compared to that found in mice treated with rat IgG. Similar results in PD-1-/- mice were obtained. Moreover, the PD-1 blockade/deficiency led to reduced parasitemia and tissue parasitism but increased mortality.

Out of the 9,390 unique genes quantified in all samples, 1,702 had their expression altered in chronic chagasic hearts compared to those of normal mice.

In a multiple regression model, the E/e' ratio was the only independent predictor of a worsening active LA emptying fraction. Conclusion: LA function is more compromised in patients with CCM than in patients with DCM. This finding indicates a more diffuse and severe myocardial impairment in Chagas disease that is probably related to increased left ventricular filling pressures and atrial myopathy. © 2011 by the American Society of Echocardiography."

This study quantitatively evaluated the association between cardiac sympathetic denervation and sustained ventricular tachycardia (SVT) in patients with CCC. Methods: We prospectively investigated patients with CCC and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 35% with SVT (SVT group: N = 15; mean age±SD, 61±8 y; LVEF, 51%±8%) and patients without SVT (non-SVT group: N = 11; mean age±SD, 55±10 y; LVEF, 57%±10%). Patients underwent myocardial scintigraphy with 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ( 123I-MIBG) for the evaluation of sympathetic innervation and resting perfusion with 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc- MIBI) for the evaluation of myocardial viability. A visual semiquantitative score was attributed for regional uptake of each radiotracer using a 17- segment left ventricular segmentation model (0, normal; 4, absence of uptake). A mismatch defect was defined as occurring in segments with a 99mTc- MIBI uptake score of 0 or 1 and a 123I-MIBG score of 2 or more. Results: Compared with the non- SVT group, the SVT group had a similar 99mTc-MIBI summed score (6.9±7.5 vs. 4.4±5.2, respectively, P = 0.69) but a higher 123I-MIBG summed score (10.9±7.8 vs. 22.4±9.5, respectively, P = 0.007) and a higher number of mismatch defects per patient (2.0±2.2 vs. 7.1±2.0, respectively, P &lt; 0.0001). The presence of more than 3 mismatch defects was strongly associated with the presence of SVT (93% sensitivity, 82% specificity; P = 0.0002). Conclusion: In CCC, the amount of sympathetically denervated viable myocardium is associated with the occurrence of SVT. Myocardial sympathetic denervation may participate in triggering malignant ventricular arrhythmia in CCC patients with relatively well-preserved ventricular function.

For vesicle preparations, cell-free supernatant fluids from yeast cells cultivated in Ham's defined medium-glucose were concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration system and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 X g. P. brasiliensis antigens were present in preparations from phylogenetically distinct isolates Pb18 and Pb3, as observed in immunoblots revealed with sera from PCM patients. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), vesicle components containing α-Gal epitopes reacted strongly with anti-α-Gal antibodies isolated from both Chagas' disease and PCM patients, with Marasmius oreades agglutinin (MOA) (a lectin that recognizes terminal α-Gal), but only faintly with natural anti-α-Gal. Reactivity was inhibited after treatment with α-galactosidase. Vesicle preparations analyzed by electron microscopy showed vesicular structures of 20 to 200 nm that were labeled both on the surface and in the lumen with MOA. In P. brasiliensis cells, components carrying α-Gal epitopes were found distributed on the cell wall, following a punctuated confocal pattern, and inside large intracellular vacuoles. Lipid-free vesicle fractions reacted with anti-α-Gal in ELISA only when not digested with α-galactosidase, while reactivity with glycoproteins was reduced after β-elimination, which is indicative of partial O-linked chain localization.

The C terminus of proteolytically activated small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is covalently linked to a lysine residue of the target protein by an isopeptide bond, through a mechanism that includes an E1-activating enzyme, an E2-conjugating enzyme, and transfer to the target, sometimes with the assistance of a ligase. The modification is reversed by a protease, also responsible for SUMO maturation. A number of proteins have been identified as SUMO targets, participating in the regulation of cell cycle progression, transcription, translation, ubiquitination, and DNA repair. In this study, we report that orthologous genes corresponding to the SUMOylation pathway are present in the etiological agent of Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi. Furthermore, the SUMOylation system is functionally active in this protozoan parasite, having the requirements for SUMO maturation and conjugation. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that T. cruzi SUMO (TcSUMO) is predominantly found in the nucleus. To identify SUMOylation targets and get an insight into their physiological roles we generated transfectant T. cruzi epimastigote lines expressing a double- tagged T. cruzi SUMO, and SUMOylated proteins were enriched by tandem affinity chromatography. By two-dimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry a total of 236 proteins with diverse biological functions were identified as potential T. cruzi SUMO targets. Of these, metacaspase-3 was biochemically validated as a bona fide SUMOylation substrate.

Amiodarone is the most prescribed class III antiarrhythmic agent and is frequently used for the symptomatic treatment of Chagas' disease patients with cardiac compromise. In addition, recent studies identified its antifungal and antiprotozoal activities, which take place through Ca2+ homeostasis disruption and ergosterol biosynthesis blockade. We tested different concentrations of amiodarone (2.5 to 10 μM) on infected primary cultures of heart muscle cells and observed a dose- and time-dependent effect on growth of the clinically relevant intracellular amastigote form of T. cruzi. Ultrastructural analyses revealed that amiodarone had a profound effect on intracellular amastigotes, including mitochondrial swelling and disorganization of reservosomes and the kinetoplast and a blockade of amastigote-trypomastigote differentiation. Amiodarone showed no toxic effects on host cells, which recovered their F-actin fibrillar organization, connexin43 distribution, and spontaneous contractility concomitant with the drug-induced eradication of the intracellular parasites.

They also infect a wide range of wild and domestic mammals and are transmitted by a numerous species of triatomine bugs. There are significant overlaps in the host and geographical ranges of both species. The two species consist of a number of distinct phylogenetic lineages. A range of PCR-based techniques have been developed to differentiate between these species and to assign their isolates into lineages. However, the existence of at least six and five lineages within T. cruzi and T. rangeli, respectively, makes identification of the full range of isolates difficult and time consuming. Here we have applied fluorescent fragment length barcoding (FFLB) to the problem of identifying and genotyping T. cruzi, T. rangeli and other South American trypanosomes. This technique discriminates species on the basis of length polymorphism of regions of the rDNA locus. FFLB was able to differentiate many trypanosome species known from South American mammals: T. cruzi cruzi, T. cruzi marinkellei, T. dionisii-like, T. evansi, T. lewisi, T. rangeli, T. theileri and T. vivax. Furthermore, all five T. rangeli lineages and many T. cruzi lineages could be identified, except the hybrid lineages TcV and TcVI that could not be distinguished from lineages III and II respectively. This method also allowed identification of mixed infections of T. cruzi and T. rangeli lineages in naturally infected triatomine bugs. The ability of FFLB to genotype multiple lineages of T. cruzi and T. rangeli together with other trypanosome species, using the same primer sets is an advantage over other currently available techniques. Overall, these results demonstrate that FFLB is a useful method for species diagnosis, genotyping and understanding the epidemiology of American trypanosomes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V."

Leishmaniasis, in particular, is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania spp. transmitted by infected phlebotomine sandfly, which remains a public health concern in developing countries with ca. 12 million people infected and 350 million at risk of infection. Despite several attempts, methods for diagnosis are still noneffective, especially with regard to specificity due to false positives with Chagas' disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Accepted golden standards for detecting leishmaniasis involve isolation of parasites either microscopically, or by culture, and in both methods specimens are obtained by invasive means. Here, we show that efficient distinction between cutaneous leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease can be obtained with a low-cost biosensor system made with nanostructured films containing specific Leishmania amazonensis and T. cruzi antigens and employing impedance spectroscopy as the detection method. This unprecedented selectivity was afforded by antigen - antibody molecular recognition processes inherent in the detection with the immobilized antigens, and by statistically correlating the electrical impedance data, which allowed distinction between real samples that tested positive for Chagas' disease and leishmaniasis. Distinction could be made of blood serum samples containing 10-5 mg/mL of the antibody solution in a few minutes.

We recently demonstrated that while αβ DN T cells serve primarily to express inflammatory cytokines, γδ DN T cells express mainly interleukin-10 (IL-10) in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis. We also demonstrated a correlation between DN T cells and the expression of gamma interferon in the acute phase of Trypanosoma cruzi experimental infection. In this work, we sought to investigate whether αβ or γδ DN T cells display distinct immunoregulatory potentials in patients with polar forms of human Chagas' disease. Our data showed that in vitro infection with T. cruzi leads to expansion of DN T cells in patients with the indeterminate and severe cardiac clinical forms of the disease. However, while αβ DN T cells primarily produce inflammatory cytokines in both forms of the disease, γδ DN T cells display a marked, significant increase in antigen-specific IL-10 expression in indeterminate patients relative to cardiac patients.

Methods and results: Over a mean of 18.5 years, we followed up a prospective cohort of 120 individuals with chronic Chagas disease. Twenty dichotomous variables with prognostic potential for chronic Chagas disease patients were initially evaluated using the Cox model (univariable analysis), to calculate the proportional mortality risk from all causes, cardiovascular causes and sudden death, relative to each variable separately. Of these, 12 variables presenting statistical significance (p < 0.05) were included in a multivariable model to determine which of them would have independent prognostic value regarding mortality. Over the follow-up, there were 42 deaths. Eight variables were proven to be independent prognostic factors for mortality, in relation to the three types of death analysed: age ? 39 years, black skin colour, high-degree right-branch block, anterosuperior division block of the left branch, high-degree right-branch block associated with anterosuperior division block of the left branch, high-degree left-branch block, polymorphic ventricular extrasystoles and PR interval ? 0.16 s.

No histopathological lesions were seen 180 days after completion of the treatments, a time when the levels of anti-T. cruzi antibodies were very low in mice treated with either NFOH or BZL. Nitrofurazone was highly toxic, which led to an overall rate of mortality of 75% and necessitated interruption of the treatment. In contrast, the group treated with its hydroxymethyl derivative, NFOH, displayed the lowest mortality (16%), followed by the BZL (33%) and placebo (66%) groups. The findings of histopathological studies were consistent with these results, with the placebo group showing the most severe parasite infiltrates in skeletal muscle and heart tissue and the NFOH group showing the lowest. The present evidence suggests that NFOH is a promising anti-T. cruzi agent. Copyright © 2010, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved."

The goal of this work is to investigate the in vitro and in vivo effects of the arylimidamide (AIA) DB766 against T. cruzi. This arylimidamide exhibits strong trypanocidal activity and excellent selectivity for bloodstream trypomastigotes and intracellular amastigotes (Y strain), giving IC50s (drug concentrations that reduce 50% of the number of the treated parasites) of 60 and 25 nM, respectively. DB766 also exerts striking effects upon different parasite stocks, including those naturally resistant to benznidazole, and displays higher activity in vitro than the reference drugs. By fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy analyses, we found that this AIA localizes in DNA-enriched compartments and induces considerable damage to the mitochondria. DB766 effectively reduces the parasite load in the blood and cardiac tissue and presents efficacy similar to that of benznidazole in mouse models of T. cruzi infection employing the Y and Colombian strains, using oral and intraperitoneal doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day that were given after the establishment of parasite infection. This AIA ameliorates electrocardiographic alterations, reduces hepatic and heart lesions induced by the infection, and provides 90 to 100% protection against mortality, which is similar to that provided by benznidazole.

Although T. cruzi reproduces predominantly by binary division, accumulating evidence indicates that particular DTUs are the result of hybridization events. Two major scenarios for the origin of the hybrid lineages have been proposed. It is accepted widely that the most heterozygous TcV and TcVI DTUs are the result of genetic exchange between TcII and TcIII strains. On the other hand, the participation of a TcI parental in the current genome structure of these hybrid strains is a matter of debate. Here, sequences of the T. cruzi-specific 195-bp satellite DNA of TcI, TcII, TcIII, TcV, and TcVI strains have been used for inferring network genealogies. The resulting genealogy showed a high degree of reticulation, which is consistent with more than one event of hybridization between the Tc DTUs. The data also strongly suggest that TcIII is a hybrid with two distinct sets of satellite sequences, and that genetic exchange between TcI and TcII parentals occurred within the pedigree of the TcV and TcVI DTUs. Although satellite DNAs belong to the fast-evolving portion of eukaryotic genomes, in >100 satellite units of nine T. cruzi strains we found regions that display 100% identity.

Based on significant decreases in both parasitemia levels and mortality rates, S2 and S3 were selected for further assays. Despite having no in vivo effect, S1 was included since it was 2-fold more potent against trypomastigotes than megazol in vitro.

In noninfected mice, S1 did not alter the levels of glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), or urea. S2 led to an increase in GOT, S3 to increases in GOT and GPT, and megazol to an increase in GOT. Infected mice were treated with each derivative at 50 and 100 mg/kg from dpi 6 to 15: S1 did not interfere with the course of infection or reduce the number of inflammatory foci in the cardiac tissue, S2 led to a significant decrease of parasitemia, and S3 decreased mortality.

Herein, we investigated the impact of sialylation mediated by trans-sialidase, a specific and unique Trypanosoma transglycosylase for sialic acid, on CD8+ T cell response of mice infected with T. cruzi. Our data demonstrate that T. cruzi uses its trans-sialidase enzyme to resialylate the CD8+ T cell surface, thereby dampening antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response that might favor its own persistence in the mammalian host. Binding of the monoclonal antibody S7, which recognizes sialic acid-containing epitopes on the 115-kDa isoform of CD43, was augmented on CD8+ T cells from ST3Gal-I-deficient infected mice, indicating that CD43 is one sialic acid acceptor for trans-sialidase activity on the CD8+ T cell surface. The cytotoxic activity of antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells against the immunodominant trans-sialidase synthetic peptide IYNVGQVSI was decreased following active trans-sialidase-mediated resialylation in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of the parasite's native trans-sialidase activity during infection strongly decreased CD8+ T cell sialylation, reverting it to the glycosylation status expected in the absence of parasite manipulation increasing mouse survival. Taken together, these results demonstrate, for the first time, that T. cruzi subverts sialylation to attenuate CD8+ T cell interactions with peptide-major histocompatibility complex class I complexes.

Lateral DNA transfer events and their inheritance has been challenging to document. In this study we modified a thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR by using additional targeted primers, along with Southern blots, fluorescence techniques, and bioinformatics, to identify lateral DNA transfer events from parasite to host. Instances of naturally occurring human infections by Trypanosoma cruzi are documented, where mitochondrial minicircles integrated mainly into retrotransposable LINE-1 of various chromosomes. The founders of five families show minicircle integrations that were transferred vertically to their progeny. Microhomology end-joining of 6 to 22 AC-rich nucleotide repeats in the minicircles and host DNA mediates foreign DNA integration. Heterogeneous minicircle sequences were distributed randomly among families, with diversity increasing due to subsequent rearrangement of inserted fragments. Mosaic recombination and hitchhiking on retrotransposition events to different loci were more prevalent in germ line as compared to somatic cells. Potential new genes, pseudogenes, and knockouts were identified. A pathway of minicircle integration and maintenance in the host genome is suggested. Thus, infection by T. cruzi has the unexpected consequence of increasing human genetic diversity, and Chagas disease may be a fortuitous share of negative selection.

Methodology/Principal Findings: This cross-sectional study included all consecutive Latin American migrants seeking medical care at a primary care facility or attending two Latino churches. After completing a questionnaire, they were screened for Chagas disease with two serological tests (Biomérieux ELISA cruzi; Biokit Bioelisa Chagas). Infected subjects underwent a complete medical work-up. Predictive factors for infection were assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.1012 persons (females: 83%; mean age: 37.2 [SD 11.3] years, Bolivians: 48% [n = 485]) were recruited. 96% had no residency permit. Chagas disease was diagnosed with two positive serological tests in 130 patients (12.8%; 95%CI 10.8%-14.9%), including 127 Bolivians (26.2%; 95%CI 22.3%-30.1%). All patients were in the chronic phase, including 11.3% with cardiac and 0.8% with digestive complications.

Results from quantitative inhibition assays indicate 16BrEA as a potent inhibitor of TcG6PDH with an IC50 of 86 ± 8 nM and those from in vitro cell viability assays confirm its toxicity for T. cruzi epimastigotes, with a LD50 of 12 ± 8 μM. In summary, we demonstrated that, in addition to host immune response enhancement, 16BrEA has a direct effect on parasite viability, most likely as a consequence of TcG6PDH inhibition. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Ravuconazole was well tolerated, as no significant side effects were observed during the treatment using 6.0 mg/kg twice a day (12 mg/kg/day) for up to 90 days. In all treated animals, parasitemia was permanently suppressed by the first day of treatment, independently of the parasite strain. Cultures of blood obtained posttreatment were negative for 90% of the animals, confirming that the drug induced a marked reduction in the parasite load. The results of PCR tests for T. cruzi in blood performed 1 month posttreatment were consistently negative for three of five and two of five animals infected with the Y and Berenice-78 strains, respectively. All ravuconazole-treated dogs consistently had negative serological test results during and until 30 days after treatment, regardless of the therapeutic scheme used. However, after the end of treatment, an increase in specific antibody levels was observed in all treated animals, although the antibody levels were always significantly lower than those of the nontreated control dogs. Despite being unable to induce a parasitological cure, ravuconazole treatment led to significant reductions in the levels of gamma interferon expression and lesions in cardiac tissues in animals infected with the Y strain, while the level of interleukin-10 mRNA expression increased. We conclude that ravuconazole has potent suppressive but not curative activity in the canine model of acute Chagas' disease, probably due to its unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties (half-life, 8.8 h). The longer half-life of ravuconazole in humans (4 to 8 days) makes it a promising drug for assessment for use as chemotherapy in human Chagas' disease.

The enzyme cruzain is the major cysteine protease from Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of American trypanosomiasis or Chagas' disease, and has been selected as an attractive target for the development of novel trypanocidal drugs. In the present work, we describe the synthesis and inhibitory effects of a series of thirty-three chalcone and seven hydrazide derivatives against the enzyme cruzain from T. cruzi. Most of the compounds showed promising in vitro inhibition (IC50 values in the range of 20-60 μM), which suggest the potential of these compounds as lead candidates for further development. Twelve compounds have not been reported before, and four of them (7, 13, 16 e 18) are among the most potent inhibitors of the series. © 2010 Sociedade Brasileira de Química."

We studied the influence of β-blockers in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. Methods and Results-We examined REMADHE trial and grouped patients according to etiology (Chagas versus non-Chagas) and β-blocker therapy. Primary end point was all-cause mortality or heart transplantation. Altogether 456 patients were studied; 27 (5.9%) were submitted to heart transplantation and 202 (44.3%) died. Chagas etiology was present in 68 (14.9%) patients; they had lower body mass index (24.1±4.1 versus 26.3±5.1, P=0.001), smaller end-diastolic left ventricle diameter (6.7±1.0 mm versus 7.0±0.9 mm, P=0.001), smaller proportion of β-blocker therapy (35.8% versus 68%, P<0.001), and higher proportion of spironolactone therapy (74.6% versus 57.8%, P=0.003). Twenty-four (35.8%) patients with Chagas disease were under β-blocker therapy and had lower serum sodium (136.6±3.1 versus 138.4±3.1 mEqs, P=0.05) and lower body mass index (22.5±3.3 versus 24.9±4.3, P=0.03) compared with those who received β-blockers. Survival was lower in patients with Chagas heart disease as compared with other etiologies. When only patients under β-blockers were considered, the survival of patients with Chagas disease was similar to that of other etiologies. The survival of patients with β-blockers was higher than that of patients without β-blockers. In Cox regression model, left ventricle end-diastolic diameter (hazard ratio, 1.78; CI, 1.15 to 2.76; P=0.009) and β-blockers (hazard ratio, 0.37; CI, 0.14 to 0.97; P=0.044) were associated with better survival. Conclusions-Our study suggests that β-blockers may have beneficial effects on survival of patients with heart failure and Chagas heart disease and warrants further investigation in a prospective, randomized trial.

The protozoan may colonize the central nervous system (CNS) of immune-compromised human hosts, thus causing neuronal disorders. Systemic control of the intracellular forms of the parasite greatly depends on the establishment of a TH1 response and subsequent nitric oxide (NO) release. At the CNS, it is known that low concentrations of NO promote neuronal survival and growth, while high concentrations exert toxic effects and neuron death. Accounting for NO production by astrocytes is the glia-derived factor S100β, which is overproduced in some neurodegenerative diseases. In the current work, we studied the expression of NO, interferon (IFN)-γ and S100β in the spinal cord tissue of IL-12p40KO mice infected with T. cruzi, a model of neurodegenerative process. Methods: IL-12p40KO and wild-type (WT) female mice infected with T. cruzi Sylvio X10/4 (105 trypomastigotes, intraperitoneally) were euthanized when IL-12p40KO individuals presented limb paralysis. Spinal cord sections were submitted to immunohistochemical procedures for localization of neurofilament, laminin, nitrotyrosine, NO synthases (NOS), IFN-γ and S100β. The total number of neurons was estimated by stereological analysis and the area and intensity of immunoreactivities were assessed by microdensitometric/morphometric image analysis. Results: No lesion was found in the spinal cord sections of WT mice, while morphological disarrangements, many inflammatory foci, enlarged vessels, amastigote nests and dying neurons were seen at various levels of IL-12p40KO spinal cord. Compared to WT mice, IL-12p40KO mice presented a decrement on total number of neurons (46.4%, p &lt; 0.05) and showed increased values of immunoreactive area for nitrotyrosine (239%, p &lt; 0.01) and NOS (544%, p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the intensity of nitrotyrosine (16%, p &lt; 0.01), NOS (38%, p &lt; 0.05) and S100β (21%, p &lt; 0.001) immunoreactivities were also augmented. No IFN-γ-labeled cells were seen in WT spinal cord tissue, contrary to IL-12p40KO tissue that displayed inflammatory infiltrating cells and also some parenchymal cells positively labeled. Conclusion: We suggest that overproduction of NO may account for neuronal death at the spinal cord of T. cruzi-infected IL-12p40KO mice and that IFN-γ and S100β may contribute to NOS activation in the absence of IL-12. © 2009 S.
