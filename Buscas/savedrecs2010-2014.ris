AB  - OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women and the risk of congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in Brazil, through a systematic review and meta-analysis.
   METHODS We searched electronic databases, grey literature and reference lists of included publications to identify epidemiological studies on the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women and on the congenital transmission rate of T. cruzi infection in Brazil published between January 1980 and June 2013. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using fixed-and random-effects models.
   RESULTS Sixteen articles were included - 12 studies on the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women (549 359 pregnant women) and nine on congenital transmission rates (1687 children born to infected mothers). Prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women ranged from 0.1% to 8.5%, and congenital transmission rates from 0% to 5.2%. The pooled prevalence of Chagas disease among pregnant women across studies was 1.1% (95% CI: 0.6-2.0); the pooled congenital transmission rate was 1.7% (95% CI: 0.9-3.1). In 2010, 34 629 pregnant women were estimated to be infected with T. cruzi, and 312-1073 children born (mean: 589 cases) with congenital infection.
   CONCLUSION Congenital Chagas disease is a neglected public health problem in Brazil. Systematic congenital Chagas disease control programs through routine prenatal screening for T. cruzi should be widely implemented in Brazil's endemic areas, to identify infected pregnant women and newborns at risk of congenital infection.

AB  - Congenital Chagas disease may be considered a global health problem and the underdiagnosis of congenital infections should be a matter of concern. Vertical transmission is an important mode of transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in non-endemic areas. Treatment in the early phases of the infection can prevent progression of the disease and is curative in the majority of cases. Prevention strategies should focus on early detection and treatment of congenital cases, screening at-risk women during pregnancy and treatment of non-pregnant women of childbearing age. Management of congenital Chagas disease and T. cruzi infection during pregnancy is discussed.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi infection, is an endemic cause of morbidity and mortality in Latin America. Infection during pregnancy may increase the risk for adverse maternal-foetal outcome.
   Review of significant articles regarding maternal-foetal T. cruzi infection in free-vector non-endemic regions.
   Vertical transmission, even in vector-free world regions, occurs in 1 out of 20 seropositive mothers. T. cruzi infection increases the risk of miscarriage, preterm birth and neonatal infection which may cause infant death or severe sequelae. Prevention of T. cruzi vertical transmission is not feasible, although early diagnosis allows appropriate treatment of newborns with a 100% efficacy. The present document will recall the importance of T. cruzi mother-to-child transmission and maternal-foetal consequences in non-endemic areas.
   It is highly recommended that infected pregnant women in non-endemic regions be accurately assessed.

AB  - Congenital transmission of Chagas disease now occurs in areas where the disease is non-endemic, and also from one generation to another. According to epidemiological data from Latin America, the prevalence of the disease in pregnant women is 0.7%-54%, and the prevalence of vertical transmission is around 5%-6%. Congenital T. cruzi infection is an acute infection in newborns that should be treated with anti-parasitic therapy. The treatment of pregnant women could also have an impact on the control of the disease. This article has been prepared following the recommendations suggested by a group of experts in Infectious Diseases, Microbiology, Gynaecology and Paediatrics. (C) 2012 Elsevier Espana, S.L.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiological characteristics of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected mothers and the live birth conditions of neonates. Methods: A serological survey with IgG-specific tests was conducted using dried blood samples from newborn infants in the State of Minas Gerais. T cruzi infection was confirmed in mothers through positive serology in two different tests, and infected mothers were required to have their infants serologically tested after the age of 6 months. The birth conditions of the neonates were obtained from the System of Information on Live Births database. Results: The study included 407 children born to T cruzi-infected mothers and 407 children born to uninfected mothers. The average age of seropositive mothers was 32 years (CI95% 31.3-32.6), which was greater than the average age of seronegative mothers - 25 years (CI95% 24.8-25.2). The mothers' level of education was higher among uninfected mothers (41% had 8 or more years of education, versus 22% between the infected mothers). Vaginal delivery was more frequent among infected mothers. There was no evidence of inter-group differences with respect to the child's sex, gestational age, birth weight or Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity and respiration (APGAR) scores at 1 and 5 minutes. Conclusions: The level of education and the greater number of previous pregnancies and cases of vaginal delivery reflect the lower socioeconomical conditions of the infected mothers. In the absence of vertical transmission, neonates had similar health status irrespective of the infection status of their mothers.

AB  - One of the most important modes of transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in areas where it is not endemic is vertical transmission: from mother to child. The objective of this report is to assess the efficacy of different programmes of serological screening to monitor infection with T. cruzi in pregnant Latin American women living in Madrid (Spain). To achieve this, a retrospective study was undertaken from January 2008 to December 2010 in seven hospitals in the Autonomous Community of Madrid. Serological screening programmes were classified in two main strategies: a selective one (pregnant women from Bolivia) and a universal one (pregnant women from Latin America). A total of 3,839 pregnant women were tested and the overall prevalence was 3.96%. The rate of congenital transmission was 2.6%. The current monitoring programmes have variable coverage ranging between 26% (selective screening) and 100% (universal screening). Monitoring of pregnant women from Latin America only reaches full coverage if universal screening of pregnant women is carried out at any moment of pregnancy, including at delivery. A common national regulation is necessary in order to ensure homogenous implementation of screening.

AB  - Background. In this longitudinal cohort study we evaluated the congenital transmission of Chagas disease (CD) in a nonendemic area. The aim of this work was to analyze the predictive value of a Trypanosoma cruzi-positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result in pregnant women for the diagnosis of vertical transmission and to evaluate the use of PCR as a tool for early detection of infection.
   Methods. The offspring of 59 seropositive pregnant mothers were followed up. The parasitological status of mothers was studied by PCR in a total of 64 pregnancies; 10 of these women had received treatment before pregnancy. Sixty-five infants (including a pair of twins) were monitored at 0, 6, 9, and 12 months of age by PCR and serology. In cases of congenital transmission, hemoculture and parasite lineage typing were performed.
   Results. Nine infants had acquired CD congenitally. This represents a transmission rate of 13.8% among seropositive mothers (9 infected newborns of 65 total live births). All infants were infected with T. cruzi discrete typing unit V strain. A statistically significant correlation was found between T. cruzi vertical transmission and a positive PCR result during pregnancy (31%; 9 infected newborns in 29 live births). No infected infants were detected among 10 mothers who were treated before they became pregnant, compared with 16.4% (9 of 55 live births) among untreated mothers.
   Conclusions. PCR is a useful tool for the detection of congenital CD, and the treatment of infected women of childbearing age seems to be useful for preventing vertical transmission.

AB  - Background: This study investigated the prevalence of Chagas disease (ChD) in pregnant women in Choapa Province (IV Region, Chile) and the vertical transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi.
   Method: ELISA and IFI IgG for ChD was performed for the pregnant women. PCR for T. cruzi was done for all chagasic mothers and their newborns. The congenital infection was confirmed by serial positive PCR and/or ELISA or IFI IgG after age of nine months. The placentas of mothers, with and without ChD, were submitted for histopathology and immunohistochemical study.
   Results: From 4831 deliveries in 2005 - 2009 with a serological coverage of 88.6%, it was established that 147 cases (3.4%) had ChD. More than 80% of the pregnancies had a physiological evolution and 90% of the newborn were term. Congenital transmission was demonstrated in six children (4.7%) of the 127 newborn studied by serial PCR (at birth and/or between 3 - 18 months) and/or ELISA or IIF IgG after age nine months. Most of congenital cases were asymptomatic (67%). The histopathology shows edema, necrosis, fibrinoid deposit in the placentas of 28 of 29 chagasic mothers. In three cases the immnunochemistry demonstrated a decrease in actin expression in trophoblast cells. In one congenital case amastigote nests was observed.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that T. cruzi infection in pregnant women and vertical transmission in Chile are still prevalent. For this reason it is important to propose control measures in endemic areas of the country.

AB  - To demonstrate the feasibility of a house-to-house screening system used for congenital Chagas disease in rural areas based on an active search for pregnant women and newborns in their homes in addition to passive case detection in health facilities.
   Methods
   Exploratory phase conducted by the research team followed by an operational period coordinated by municipal health service. A blood sample was taken for serological and parasitological tests of Trypanosoma cruzi from pregnant women who were searching antenatal care or visited at home by field investigators. Infants born to T. cruzi-infected women were examined for infection at birth and again at 1 and 7 months of age.
   Results
   64.5% of the pregnant women were infected. Congenital infection was diagnosed at birth in 4.0% (12/299) of the children born to seroreactive mothers. Twelve additional cases of infection (4%) were diagnosed in children between 1 and 7 months of age. Finally, 37% of the children were lost to follow-up in the exploratory phase and 53% during the operational phase (P = 0.002), significantly fewer than in most passive case detection studies.
   Conclusion
   Despite poorer outcomes after door-to-door screening activities have been transferred to the health system, a combined strategy based on active and passive case detection appeared to be efficient for identifying rural cases of congenital Chagas disease.

AB  - Chagas disease ranks among the world's most neglected tropical diseases and congenital transmission is increasingly responsible for urbanization of Chagas disease in non-endemic areas.
   Molecular assays for amplification and profiling of parasite minicircle DNA (kDNA) and identification of discrete typing units (DTUs) were prospectively conducted in bloodstream and placental samples from pregnant women cursing chronic Chagas disease residing in Buenos Aires city.
   Sensitivity of kDNA-PCR increased from 75.6% to 95.6% when one to three sequential blood samples were analysed. Congenital infection (CI) was diagnosed in 3 neonates born to kDNA-PCR positive mothers, one who had transmitted CI in a previous gestation, pointing to family clustering of congenital transmission. Fourteen of 44 placental samples were kDNA-PCR positive, all from non-CI transmitting women, indicating that placental PCR is not useful for CI diagnosis. Placental PCR positivity was not related to maternal bloodstream PCR positivity and placental parasitic subpopulations not observed in bloodstream were detected by minicircle signatures. PCR targeted to intergenic regions of spliced-leader genes and serological tests using trypomastigote small surface recombinant antigens showed predominance of DTU group TcII/V/VI and only one patient infected with TcI.
   To our knowledge, this is the first PCR-based follow-up study of bloodstream and placental T. cruzi infections during pregnancy, including identification of DTUs. kDNA-PCR assays in serial blood samples provided high sensitivity for detection of T. cruzi DNA in pregnant women with chronic Chagas disease.

AB  - Congenital Chagas disease acquired special importance in Chile after the certification of the control of Triatoma infestans and transmission by blood donors affected with Trypanosoma cruzi. In order to establish adequate protocols for intervention and control in infected mother-neonate pairs in endemic zones of Chagas disease, we present partial results (2005-2008) of a pilot project which is being carried out in the Province of Choapa, IV Region, Chile, whose objectives are: determine the current prevalence of the disease in pregnant women, estimate the incidence of vertical transmission of T. cruzi to newborns, determine the lineages of the parasite present in mothers who do and do not transmit the disease, determine the prevalence of Chagas disease in maternal grandmothers of neonates and study placental histopathology. Preliminary results indicated that in this study period, 3.7% of the women who gave birth in the Province have Chagas disease and 2.5% of their newborns were infected. The most frequent T. cruzi genotypes found in mothers studied during pregnancy were TCI and TCIId, either alone or in mixed infections. A high percentage (74.3%) of the grandmothers studied was infected with the parasite. In 29 placentas from mothers with Chagas disease we observed edema, necrosis, fibrinoid deposits and slight lymphoplasmocyte infiltration. In three placentas we found erythroblastosis and in one of them amastigote forms of T. cruzi; this was one of the cases of congenital infection. The evaluation of the diagnostic and control protocols generated will allow us to determine if it has been possible to modify the natural history of vertical transmission of T. cruzi in Chile.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease (CD) is endemic in countries of continental Latin America. Congenital transmission is a major concern worldwide. In 2010, the Public Health Agency of Catalonia (ASPCAT) launched a screening protocol for Trypanosoma cruzi infection in pregnant women and their newborns. In 2012, ASPCAT detected appropriate follow-up of pregnant women but incomplete information about their offspring.
   Methods: The PROSICS community health team carried out active surveillance and community health action in target populations. These activities included active case searches, group awareness workshops and visualization campaigns as well as investigation of all lost children born from pregnant women with CD and their families.
   Results: Overall, 42/179 (23.5%) cases were included in the study: 35/42 (83.3%) children were born in Hospitalet de Llobregat (Catalonia, Spain); 4/42 (16.7%) were born in Latin America; two were miscarried and one was stillborn. The mean age of pregnant women was 31.3 years (SD 5.52; range: 21-44): 90.5% were Bolivian, of whom 74% were diagnosed with CD during pregnancy. Of the 35 newborns, 31 were recovered by community health action; 12/31 were correctly controlled at Hospitalet de Llobregat and 19/31 were controlled at a primary health centre. Of these 19 (73.7%)cases, 14 were not tested for CD by family paediatricians and were recovered by the PROSICS community health team. Finally, two (6.9%)of the 29 newborns tested with serology were positive.
   Conclusions: It is essential to implement active surveillance, education and information activities at paediatric primary care and community levels to avoid the loss of CD-infected mothers and their newborns. Training sessions addressed to paediatricians and other involved health professionals would consolidate surveillance and care reference circuits, improving the control of congenital CD.

KW  - CONGENITAL TRANSMISSION
AB  - One hundred fifty-two Trypanosoma cruzi seropositive women were submitted to a single hemoculture; 101 were pregnant, and 51 were not pregnant. Seven tubes from each individual were harvested with liver infusion tryptose (LIT) medium and observed monthly until the fifth month. Hemocultures were positive in 50% (76 of 152) of the women. Results showed that the positivity was 29.4% (15 of 51) among non-pregnant women and 60.4% (61 of 101) in pregnant women (P < 0.05). In relation to gestational age, there were significant differences in positivity, with a higher proportion of women with positive hemocultures (20 of 25) before 21 weeks and lower after 30 weeks (10 of 21; P = 0.02). We conclude that pregnancy enhances the parasitemia in Chagas disease, with a higher effect early in pregnancy.

AB  - Chagas disease is a chronic infection that kills approximately 12,000 people a year. Mass migration of chronically infected and asymptomatic persons has caused globalization of Chagas disease and has made nonvectorial infection, including vertical and blood-borne transmission, more of a threat to human communities than vectorial infection. To control transmission, it is essential to test all pregnant women living in endemic countries and all pregnant women having migrated from, or having lived in, endemic countries. All children born to seropositive mothers should be tested not only within the first month of life but also at similar to 6 months and similar to 12 months of age. The diagnosis is made by identification of the parasite in blood before the age of 6 months and by identification of the parasite in blood and/or positive serology after 10 months of age. Follow up for a year is essential as a significant proportion of cases are initially negative and are only detected at a later stage. If the condition is diagnosed and treated early, the clinical response is excellent and the majority of cases are cured.

AB  - Chagas disease is a chronic and systemic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi According to estimates from WHO, 10 million people are affected by this parasite. In the last years, birthrate among the immigrant women from Latin America settled in the Comunidad Autonoma de Madrid has been increasing, and as T cruzi can be transmitted from mother to child, in fact 11 cases of congenital Chagas disease have been confirmed. Therefore, the aim of this paper is encouraging improvements in the coverage of the anti-T. cruzi antibodies detection in pregnant women from endemic areas. By this strategy, an active search for infected pregnant women and early detection of her infected newborns could be conducted, and then an early specific treatment could be administrated. Thus, there could be an important contribution to the control of Chagas disease in non-endemic area.

AB  - Chagas disease is a systemic chronic parasitic infection by Trypanosoma cruzi endemic in Latin America. Migration of women of childbearing age from Latin America to developed countries may spread the disease to non-endemic areas through vertical transmission.
   Prospective study of seroprevalence of T. cruzi infection in immigrant Latin American pregnant women during a 5-year period (from 2006 to 2010) in Spain.
   Seven out of 545 participants were seropositive for T. cruzi [prevalence 1.28%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06-2.56]. Four (57%) were from Bolivia and three (43.%) from Paraguay. The seroprevalence in pregnant women from Bolivia was 10.26% (95% CI 4.06-23.58) and in participants from Paraguay was 6.52% (95% CI 2.24-17.5). No congenital transmission occurred.
   Seroprevalence of T. cruzi infection in Latin American pregnant women coming from Bolivia and Paraguay is high. Those women should be screened for T. cruzi to control mother-to-child transmission in non-endemic areas.

AB  - To determine the role of pregnancy on Trypanosoma cruzi parasitemia, a matched cohort study was carried out in a rural Bolivian community comparing parasite rates in gravidae, puerperae, and non-pregnant infected women. A selection of 67 chronically infected women, who delivered between March 2004 and May 2005, were initially evaluated during the third trimester of pregnancy and again after delivery. They were matched for age, parity, and location with 104 seropositive non-pregnant women, who likewise had submitted blood for microscopic examination for T. cruzi parasites in June 2005. Seroreactive pregnant women had a higher rate of T cruzi parasitemia (14.9%) than matched non-pregnant infected women (2.9%; P = 0.004). After delivery, parasitemia significantly decreased during puerperium (1.5%) compared with the period of pregnancy (14.9%; P = 0.03). This study showed an increase of parasite loads in maternal peripheral blood, during the third trimester, and a significant decline after delivery.

AB  - Parasitic infections affect tens of millions of pregnant women worldwide. These infections lead directly and indirectly to a spectrum of adverse maternal and fetal/placental effects. With the increase in global travel, healthcare providers will care for women who have recently moved from or traveled to areas where these infections are endemic. We reviewed the literature, assessing case reports, case series, and prospective and retrospective trials, to provide guidelines for management of common parasitic infections in pregnancy. Parasitic infections tend to preferentially affect 1 part of the maternal-fetal unit. Thus, we categorize parasitic infections into those that preferentially cause harm to the mother, preferentially affect the fetus, and preferentially affect the placenta.
   Target Audience: Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Family Physicians, and Nurse Midwives.
   Learning Objectives: After completing this CME activity, physicians should be better able to differentiate immune modulators associated with parasitic infection and their relationship to adverse pregnancy outcomes; assess the specific effects of certain parasitic infections on the gravid female, her placenta, and her fetus; and in addition, design a treatment regimen for pregnant women presenting with a parasitic infection.

AB  - The congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi has gained epidemiological importance because it is partially responsible for the spread of Chagas disease worldwide. The feasibility of a cure when infected children are treated early makes the detection of congenital infection a valuable goal toward the control of the disease. Here, the authors review and discuss the findings of Bua et al., who quantified the parasitemia of infected women and their newborns by quantitative PCR. The authors demonstrate that the maternal parasite burden is directly related to the risk of neonatal infection. This study points out the importance of a quantitative screen for T. cruzi in pregnant women who live in, or have traveled to, endemic areas for improving the diagnosis of infected newborns and providing prompt treatment.

AB  - Congenital transmission of Chagas disease stand out as a major public health problem since the vector control was performed in all endemic areas and has shown its effectiveness. An epidemiological study was performed in three maternity hospitals of the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia from 2006 to 2008. The serological screening for Trypanosoma cruzi infection was carried out in 15,767 pregnant women. Chagas infection was detected in 3725 women (23.6%), who gave birth to 125 newborns infected by T. cruzi at birth, representing an incidence of 790 per 100,000 births during a period of 16 months and a vertical transmission rate by 3.4%. There was a significant difference between hospitals that might be explained by socio-economic origins of mothers and diagnostic constraints. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study describes the results of the health programme implemented in the Valencian Community (Spain) to achieve an early diagnosis of Chagas disease in pregnant Latin American women and their newborns. During 2009 and 2010, 1975 women living in the health districts of three university hospitals were enrolled via midwives or at the time of delivery. Diagnosis of disease was performed using two serological tests with different antigens. Congenital infection was diagnosed by parasitological, molecular or serological methods from blood samples obtained at birth or in subsequent controls. The overall seroprevalence of Chagas infection in pregnant women from 16 different endemic countries was 11.4%. Infection was higher in those from countries in the Gran Chaco Region (Bolivia, 34.1%; Paraguay, 7.4%; Argentina, 5.3%). Eight newborn infants from Bolivian mothers had congenital Chagas which represents a vertical transmission rate of 3.7%. In conclusion, this work supports the benefits of offering an early diagnosis to pregnant women and newborns during routine prenatal healthcare.

AB  - Objective. To assess the prevalence of antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) in a sample of domestic dogs living in two endemic municipalities. Materials and methods. Serum samples were taken from 20 dogs from households with seropositive pregnant women, and 40 dogs from households with seronegative pregnant women in Miraflores and Moniquira, Boyaca. The analysis was carried out through INBios RDT dipstick. Results. A prevalence of 16.7% and 13.3% in Moniquira and Miraflores respectively was found, with an overall prevalence of 15% in the two municipalities. There is a risk of acquiring infection in dogs three times greater in households with sero positive pregnant women. Flea and tick infestation in the animal, and habitat near the house, were associated with higher prevalence in the canine. Conclusions. Breed, gender, presence of birds in the house and clinical examination are considered prognostic factors for the infection by Trypanosoma cruzi in canines. As protection factors de-worming and vaccination of animals were identified.

AB  - Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, the epidemiological factors associated with it, and the risk of maternal-foetal transmission in pregnant women from endemic areas seen in the catchment area of Cruces Hospital (Basque Country, Spain).
   Methods: Descriptive study. Diagnosis of T. cruzi infection in pregnant women and neonates by performing serological tests and parasitological diagnosis using PCR. Epidemiological survey and multivariate analysis to identify the risk factors associated with T. cruzi infection.
   Results: A total of 158 women participated in the study between December 2008 and January 2010, with mean age of 28.5 (+/-5.3). Nineteen (12%) pregnant mothers were seropositive, of whom 16(84.2%) came from Bolivia, with a prevalence, in this group, of 22.2%. Independent epidemiological risk factors associated with T. cruzi infection were a history of living in mud houses (OR: 4.62; 95% IC: 1.54-13.87; P=.006) and knowledge of the vector (OR: 9.07; 95% IC: 1.91-43.11; P=.006). There was one newborn infected, which assumed a congenital transmission rate of 5.8%
   Conclusions: On the basis of the high prevalence of T. cruzi infection detected in Latin-American pregnant women and the risk of vertical transmission a screening program would be recommended, which would be fundamentally based on the identification of geographic origin and epidemiological variables.

AB  - Introduction: The diagnosis of chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection is supported by serological tests whose reproducibility has not been well documented.
   Objective: To evaluate the reproducibility of the serological tests ELISA, IFAT and IHAT for the diagnosis of T. cruzi infection in pregnant women in an endemic zone in Santander.
   Materials and methods: Through an evaluation study of diagnostic technologies, the reproducibility of the serological tests ELISA, IFAT and IHAT was determined in serum and eluted blood from pregnant women living in an endemic area for Chagas' disease in Santander. The samples were selected by cross sectional sampling. The software Stata (TM) version 10.0 was used for statistical analysis. By means of the comparison of the highest kappa coefficient of each technique, the test with the best reproducibility was determined.
   Results: A total of 777 samples were tested. In serum, ELISA (cutoff point: 0.3), IFAT (cutoff point: 1/32) and IHAT (cutoff point: 1/16) had kappa coefficients greater than 0.8 (0.98, 95% CI: 0.93-1.00; 0.98, 95% CI: 0.92-1.00 and 0.88, 95% CI: 0.74-0.97, respectively); no statistically significant differences among the three tests were found (p > 0.05). For the blood eluates, kappa coefficients were below 0.8 (highest kappa: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.41-0.68).
   Conclusions: For the three serological tests using serum, the reproducibility determined by the kappa coefficient was perfect. Selecting any of them is useful for the diagnosis of T. cruzi infection. Given its simplicity and cost, the ELISA test is recommended for screening for this infection.

Parasitemia was quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in the peripheral blood amplifying a nuclear T. cruzi DNA and expressed as equivalent amounts of CL Brener parasites DNA per ml (eP/ml). Similar levels of parasitemia were found in non-transmitting pregnant women and in non-pregnant women: 1.8 +/- 0.5 and 1.5 +/- 0.7 eP/ml, respectively. In women pregnant with infected children parasitemia was 11.0 +/- 2.7 eP/ml (n=20). In 12 of their neonates the infection was detected by microscopic observation of the parasites in peripheral blood in the 1st month of age. These children had variable levels of parasitemia (13 000 +/- 7000 eP/ml), that were about 600-fold higher than that found in their mothers. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative evaluation of parasitemia in these three groups of women and in their congenitally infected children. These parasite quantifications could be a basis to plan the control of mother-to-child transmission of T. cruzi. (C) 2012 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This report describes the case of a patient with acute Chagas disease in Tocantins, Brazil, who was unaware of her pregnancy during benznidazole treatment. She presented with impaired cardiac function during the acute phase (pericarditis and incomplete right bundle-branch block) that resolved favorably after benznidazole therapy. Serological results also became negative, as determined by hemagglutination assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and immunofluorescence assays. The child was born without sequelae and showed no evidence of congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection at birth or 24 days later.

AB  - Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and is an endemic zoonosis in the American continent. Thanks to the successful implementation of national programs for reducing the vectorial infestation and the strict control of blood-borne transmission of Chagas disease, the relative importance of congenital transmission has recently increased. Nowadays, in areas without vectorial transmission, congenital transmission has become the main way by which the disease has spread. This article reviews current knowledge on Chagas disease, focusing on the congenital transmission route. The public health implications of the increasing number of T cruzi-infected immigrants and congenital transmission in nonendemic areas is also analyzed.

AB  - Introduction: The increase in immigration is changing the prevalence of mother to child infectious diseases. Our aim is to determine the serological profile of foreign pregnant women against these infections.
   Methods: A retrospective cross sectional study was performed in a tertiary hospital from Madrid between August 2007 and October 2008. The seroprevalence against HIV, HBV, HCV, rubeola, T. gondii, T. pallidum and T. cruzi was determined in every pregnant immigrant, as well as in a representative group of Spanish pregnant women.
   Results: A total of 2526 immigrant and 157 Spanish pregnant women were studied. None of the Spanish and 0.5% of the foreigners showed antibodies against HIV; 18.9% of them were Sub-Saharan women. Antigen HBs was detected in 2% of the immigrant women and in 1.1% of the Spanish women. Asian women had the highest rate of type B Hepatitis (10.9%). There was 0.9% of type C Hepatitis among the immigrants and 1% among the Spanish. Within the cases with RPR >= 1/8, 1.6% were immigrants, most of whom were Latin American. Thirty-one per cent of the immigrants showed antibodies against T. gondii (37.5% from Central America, 2.5% from the Far East). More than 95% of the Spanish women had antibodies against Rubella, this being lower in the rest of the areas (75.5% in Sub-Saharan Africa). T. cruzi infection was detected in 12.1% of the Bolivian women studied.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of mother-to-child transmitted infections depends on the origin of pregnant women. Knowledge of these differences may lead to improved control these diseases. (C) 2010 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Immigration has introduced new diseases into Spanish society, one of which is Chagas disease. Young women of childbearing age and children infected with Tlypanosoma cruzi from endemic areas are at risk of developing the disease years later, and pregnant women can transmit the infection through the placenta.
   Methods: Serological screening for anti-T. cruzi antibodies was performed on all immigrant children coming from a Chagas endemic area and seen in our Pathology Unit between 2003 and 2008, as well as on newborns of T. cruzi positive infected pregnant women coming from Latin America. Two ELISA tests were used (bioelisa Chagas Biokit (R) with recombinant antigens, and an 'in house' ELISA with crude antigen). Patients with sufficient sample were also screened by nested PCR (TCZ3/Z4).
   Results: A total of 202 children, aged 1 day to 14 years old were included in the study, of whom 22 (10.8%) were diagnosed with asymptomatic infection, 5 of which were congenital as they were born in this country. All infected patients received treatment with benznidazole, with three of them currently with a serologically negative result after treatment.
   Conclusion: Chagas disease is a new imported paediatric disease that can affect children from endemic countries, but can also be acquired in our country by vertical transmission. Therefore, we believe that it is essential to perform serological screening on all children and pregnant women in the prenatal care from endemic areas, and provide specific treatment for those infected patients, given the good results observed in the paediatric population.

AB  - The impact of Chagas disease is no longer restricted to endemic areas. The aim of this study is to evaluate a 2-year period of a vertical transmission screening program of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in a tertiary care hospital in Barcelona (Spain). Two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (recombinant and crude antigen) were performed in parallel to pregnant women at risk of T. cruzi infection. Discordant results were confirmed by a third diagnostic test. In the case of a positive result, the newborn was tested at birth and after 8 months of life. A total of 1,473 women met the inclusion criteria for the screening program with a resulting seroprevalence for T. cruzi of 3.5% (2.2-5.2% 95% confidence interval [95% CI]). One case of congenital infection was identified. Screening programs for vertically transmitted T. cruzi acute infection are beneficial in non-endemic areas for early detection and treatment of acute infection.

AB  - Background: Health professionals who care for patients with imported diseases often lack enough training. The aim of the study is to assess the knowledge of Chagas disease among doctors and nurses attending at-risk pregnant women in our province.
   Method: descriptive study through a performed anonymous and voluntary knowledge questionnaire for 278 physicians and nurses working at maternity and children's health services in the three hospitals in the province. In Poniente Hospital was established in 2007 a program of screening for the disease in pregnant women. For statistical analysis, quantitative variables were described using the mean and standard deviation. For comparison of qualitative variables we used the chi-square test or Fisher exact test as appropriate. Differences in age and years of experience depending on the hospital were measured by Brown-Forsythe robust test.
   Results: 116 (41.7%) professionals agreed to participate in the study. 80 (69%) were women and 36 (31%) men, mean age 36.78 years. By professional categories, physicians have a mean of 73.9% correct responses, the nurses 50.7%. Poniente Hospital had the highest percentage of correct answers on aspects of the geographical distribution of the disease (73.7%), the mechanisms of transmission (86%) and diagnosis (82.5%).
   Conclusions: The Poniente Hospital professionals generally have a better Knowledge about Chagas disease compared with two other professionals hospitals, which probably is related to the existence of the screening program for the disease.

AB  - The first case of neonatal Chagas was reported in Mexico in 1998, but there have been no studies since then. Therefore, we investigated the rates of congenital infection of Trypanosoma cruzi by examining the seroprevalence among 1448 pregnant women in Oaxaca, Jalisco and Mexico City. We performed ELISAs to screen for recombinant and total antigens in mothers, and examined the frequency of congenital T. cruzi transmission by PCR with cord blood and antibody testing in children when they reached two years old. Our results showed that the prevalence of infection in pregnant women was 7.32% (106/1448) overall, and 4.4% (35/794) in Oaxaca, 12.02% (67/557) in Jalisco and 4.12% (4/97) in the Mexico City. In Oaxaca, T. cruzi infection was detected by PCR in 20% (7/35) of infants born to seroreactive mothers and 11.9% (8/67) in Jalisco. No infections were identified in infants from the Mexico City. From these only eleven serological follow up their children are agree to take blood. Therefore, the maternal-fetal overall transmission rate was 4.08% (4/98) in Oaxaca and 9.1% (3/33) in Jalisco 1.5% (1/65) children with positive serology were given specific treatment Chagas. In conclusion, these are the first reports of the rates of congenital Chagas disease in Mexico. The seroprevalence was higher in mothers from Jalisco, and could be related to that there is not the periodic fumigation of the transmitting vector performed in that state. The high rates of maternal-fetal transmission found in Oaxaca could be related to the differences of pathogenicity of trypanosome. No association between both the rate of congenital transmission and the gynecologic anthropometric data was observed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bolivia is one of the most endemic countries for Chagas disease. Data of 2005 shows that incidence is around 1.09% inhabitants and seroprevalence in children under 15 ranged from 10% in urban areas to 40% in rural areas. In this article, we report results obtained during the implementation of the congenital Chagas program, one of the biggest casuistry in congenital Chagas disease, led by National Program of Chagas and Belgian cooperation from 2004 to 2009. The program strategy was based on serological results during pregnancy and on the follow up of children born from positive mothers until one year old; if positive, treatment was done with Benznidazole, 10 mg/Kg/day/30 days with one post treatment control 6 months later. Throughout the length of the program, a total of 318,479 pregnant women were screened and 23.31% were detected positive. 42,538 children born from positive mothers were analyzed at birth by micromethod, of which 1.43% read positive. 10,120 children returned for their second micromethod control of which 2.29% read positive, 7,650 children returned for the serological control, of which 3.32% turned out positive. From the 1,093 positive children, 70% completed the 30 day-treatment and 122 returned for post treatment control with 96% showing a negative result. It has been seen that maternal-fetal transmission rates vary between 2% and 4%, with an average of 2.6% (about half of previously reported studies that reached 5%). In this work, we show that it is possible to implement, with limited resources, a National Congenital Chagas Program and to integrate it into the Bolivian health system. Keys of success are population awareness, health personnel motivation, and political commitment at all levels.

AB  - BackgroundChagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is endemic in much of Latin America. With increased globalisation and immigration, it is a risk in any country, partly through congenital transmission. The frequency of congenital transmission is unclear.
   ObjectiveTo assess the frequency of congenital transmission of T.cruzi.
   Search strategyPubMed, Journals@Ovid Full Text, EMBASE, CINAHL, Fuente Academica and BIREME databases were searched using seven search terms related to Chagas disease or T.cruzi and congenital transmission.
   Selection criteriaThe inclusion criteria were the following: Dutch, English, French, Portuguese or Spanish language; case report, case series or observational study; original data on congenital T.cruzi infection in humans; congenital infection rate reported or it could be derived. This systematic review included 13 case reports/series and 51 observational studies.
   Data collection and analysisTwo investigators independently collected data on study characteristics, diagnosis and congenital infection rate. The principal summary measure - the congenital transmission rate - is defined as the number of congenitally infected infants divided by the number of infants born to infected mothers. A random effects model was used.
   Main resultsThe pooled congenital transmission rate was 4.7% (95% confidence interval: 3.9-5.6%). Countries where T.cruzi is endemic had a higher rate of congenital transmission compared with countries where it is not endemic (5.0% versus 2.7%).
   ConclusionsCongenital transmission of Chagas disease is a global problem. Overall risk of congenital infection in infants born to infected mothers is about 5%. The congenital mode of transmission requires targeted screening to prevent future cases of Chagas disease.

AB  - Chagas' disease is produced by the haemophlagelated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by haematophages insects such as Triatoma infestans (vinchuca). Due to vector control, congenital transmission gains importance and is responsible for the presence and expansion of this disease in non-endemic areas.
   The mechanisms of congenital infection are uncertain. It has been suggested that the parasite reaches the fetus through the bloodstream by crossing the placental barrier, and that congenital Chagas' disease is the result of complex interactions between the immune response, placental factors, and the parasite's characteristics.
   We review the cellular and molecular mechanisms of infection and invasion of the parasite and how immune and placental factors may modulate this process. Finally, we propose a possible model for the vertical transmission of Chagas' disease.

AB  - Due to considerable numbers of migrants from Chagas disease-endemic countries living in Catalonia, the Catalonian Health Department has recently implemented a screening programme for preventing congenital transmission, targeting Latin American pregnant women who attend antenatal consultations. Diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in women is based on two positive serological tests. Screening of new-borns from mothers with positive serology is based on a parasitological test during the first 48 hours of life and/or conventional serological analysis at the age of nine months. If either of these tests is positive, treatment with benznidazole is started following the World Health Organization's recommendations. The epidemiological surveillance of the programme is based on the Microbiological Reporting System of Catalonia, a well established network of laboratories. Once a positive case is reported, the responsible physician is asked to complete a structured epidemiological questionnaire. Clinical and demographic data are registered in the Voluntary Case Registry of Chagas Disease, a database administered by the Catalonian Health Department. It is expected that this programme will improve the understanding of the real burden of Chagas disease in the region. Furthermore, this initiative could encourage the implementation of similar programmes in other regions of Spain and even in other European countries.

AB  - Knowledge of the prevalence and risk factors associated with maternal infection is the first step to develop a surveillance system for congenital transmission of Chagas disease. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Casanare, a disease-endemic area in Colombia. A total of 982 patients were enrolled in the study. A global prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection of 4.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.8-5.3%) was found. Multivariate analysis showed that the most important risk-associated factors were age > 29 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3.4, 95% CI = 0.9-12.4), rural residency (aOR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.0-4.6), low education level (aOR = 10.2, 95% CI = 1.6-82.7), and previous knowledge of the vector (aOR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.0-4.9). Relatives and siblings of infected mothers showed a prevalence of 9.3%. These findings may help physicians to investigate congenital cases, screen Chagas disease in siblings and relatives, and provide early treatment to prevent the chronic complications of Chagas disease.

AB  - Chagas disease is endemic in Latin America, but migration has expanded the disease's geographical limits. Spain is the most affected country in Europe. From 2007, a specific Chagas disease programme aimed at at-risk migrants was developed in three Spanish cities (Madrid, Jerez de la Frontera and Alicante). The objectives of the programme were to increase participants' knowledge and decrease their fears about the disease and to encourage them to undergo screening for Trypanosoma cruzi infection. The programme was specially focused on migrants from Bolivia and Latin American women of childbearing age. Culturally tailored interventions were carried out in non-clinical settings. A total of 276 migrants were screened using a rapid immunochromatographic test following talks on the disease: the results were then later confirmed by standard serological tests. Of those tested, 44 (15.9%) were confirmed cases of Chagas disease. All of them came from Bolivia and a quarter were pregnant women. Of the 44 cases, 31 were later followed up at a specialised Chagas disease clinic. We consider that the adaptation of the programme to the target population's needs and collaboration with non-governmental organisations and migrants' associations contributed to the acceptance of the programme and the increasing number of patients seen at a specialised clinic

AB  - We sought to determine the serological test that could be used for Trypanosoma cruzi seroprevalence studies in Mexico, where lineage I predominates. In a previous study among pregnant women and their newborns in the states of Yucatan and Guanajuato, we reported a 0.8-0.9% of prevalence for T. cruzi-specific antibodies by Stat-Pak and Wiener ELISA. We have expanded this study here by performing an additional non-commercial ELISA and confirming the seropositives with Western blot, using whole antigens of a local parasite strain. We found a seroprevalence of 0.6% (3/500) in Merida and 0.4% in Guanajuato (2/488). The 5 seropositive umbilical cord samples reacted to both non-commercial ELISA and Western blot tests, and only 1 of the maternal samples was not reactive to non-commercial ELISA. A follow-up of the newborns at 10 mo was performed in Yucatan to determine the presence of T. cruzi antibodies in children as evidence of congenital infection. None of the children was seropositive. One newborn from an infected mother died at 2 wk of age of cardiac arrest, but T. cruzi infection was not confirmed. The T. cruzi seroprevalence data obtained with both commercial tests (Stat-Pak and ELISA Wiener) are similar to those from non-commercial tests using a local Mexican strain of T. cruzi.

AB  - The acute phase of Chagas disease lasts 4-8 weeks and is characterized by microscopically detectable parasitaemia. Symptoms are usually mild with severe acute disease occurring in less than 1% of patients. Orally transmitted Trypanosoma cruzi outbreaks can have more severe acute morbidity and higher mortality than vector-borne infection. Congenital T. cruzi infection occurs in 1-10% of infants of infected mothers. Most congenital infections are asymptomatic or cause non-specific signs, requiring laboratory screening for detection. A small proportion of congenital infections cause severe morbidity with hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia, meningoencephalitis and/or respiratory insufficiency, with an associated high mortality. Infected infants are presumed to carry the same 20-30% lifetime risk of cardiac or gastrointestinal disease as other infected individuals. Most control programs in Latin America employ prenatal serological screening followed by microscopic examination of cord blood from infants of seropositive mothers. Recent data confirm that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is more sensitive and detects congenital infections earlier than conventional techniques. For infants not diagnosed at birth, conventional serology is recommended at at 6 to 9 months of age. In programs that have been evaluated, less than 20% of at risk infants completed all steps of the screening algorithm. A sensitive, specific and practical screening test for newborns is needed to enable Chagas disease to be added to newborn screening programs.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease, a potentially fatal parasitic infection, is emerging in Europe in the context of international migration but there is little public health attention and frequent lack of clinicians' awareness. To date, there is no published information about clinical characteristics in children.
   Methods: We reviewed the medical files of all children (<18 years) with Chagas disease managed in 2 hospitals in Barcelona, Spain and Geneva, Switzerland between January 2004 and July 2012.
   Results: Forty-five cases were identified. Two children (4.4%) were diagnosed during the acute phase and the remaining 43 (95.6%) were in the chronic phase of the infection. All but 1 were asymptomatic. Of the 41 treated children, 40 (97.6%) completed 60 days of treatment. Thirty-five (85.4%) received benznidazole, 5 (12.2%) nifurtimox and 1 (2.4%) both drugs consecutively. There were 2 (4.9%) treatment interruptions due to adverse events. The most frequent adverse events were rash (24.4%), anorexia or insufficient weight gain (14.6%) and anemia (2.4%). Twenty-nine (64.4%) children were followed up by serology after 2 years. Five (17.2%) were cured.
   Conclusions: Pediatric Chagas disease is an emerging health issue in Europe that requires enhanced attention. Greater emphasis should be put on screening pregnant women at risk and their newborns in case of infection along with older children and relatives. Pediatricians have a central role to play in providing families with information and offering testing in situations of risk.

AB  - This review defines the concepts of maternal-fetal (congenital) and vertical transmissions (mother-to-child) of pathogens and specifies the human parasites susceptible to be congenitally transferred. It highlights the epidemiological features of this transmission mode for the three main congenital parasitic infections due to Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi and Plasmodium sp. Information on the possible maternal-fetal routes of transmission, the placental responses to infection and timing of parasite transmission are synthesized and compared. The factors susceptible to be involved in parasite transmission and development of congenital parasitic diseases, such as the parasite genotypes, the maternal co-infections and parasitic load, the immunological features of pregnant women and the capacity of some fetuses/neonates to overcome their immunological immaturity to mount an immune response against the transmitted parasites are also discussed and compared. Analysis of clinical data indicates that parasitic congenital infections are often asymptomatic, whereas symptomatic newborns generally display non-specific symptoms. The long-term consequences of congenital infections are also mentioned, such as the imprinting of neonatal immune system and the possible trans-generational transmission. The detection of infection in pregnant women is mainly based on standard serological or parasitological investigations. Amniocentesis and cordocentesis can be used for the detection of some fetal infections. The neonatal infection can be assessed using parasitological, molecular or immunological methods; the place of PCR in such neonatal diagnosis is discussed. When such laboratory diagnosis is not possible at birth or in the first weeks of life, standard serological investigations can also be performed 8-10 months after birth, to avoid detection of maternal transmitted antibodies. The specific aspects of treatment of T. gondii, T. cruzi and Plasmodium congenital infections are mentioned. The possibilities of primary and secondary prophylaxes, as well as the available WHO corresponding recommendations are also presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chagas disease is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, a flagellated organism that is transmitted mainly to humans through the infected feces of triatomine kissing bugs (vector transmission in endemic areas) or by transfusion of infected blood, donations of infected organ, or transmission from an infected mother to her child at birth. Chagas disease was first described in 1909 by the Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, and due to the parasite's distribution throughout North, Central and South America, the disease is commonly known as American trypanosomiasis. However, this disease is now present in non-endemic countries such as Canada, the United States of America, and several countries in Europe (principally Spain). Moreover, Chagas disease was recently designated by the World Health Organization as one of the main neglected tropical diseases. The aim of this review is to summarize the research efforts recently described in studies conducted in Mexico on Chagas disease. In this country, there are no existing vector control programs. In addition, there is no consensus on the diagnostic methods for acute and chronic Chagas disease in maternity wards and blood banks, and trypanocidal therapy is not administered to chronic patients. The actual prevalence of the disease is unknown because no official reporting of cases is performed. Therefore, the number of people infected by different routes of transmission (vector, congenital, blood transfusion, organ transplantation, or oral) is unknown. We believe that by promoting education about Chagas disease in schools starting at the basic elementary level and including reinforcement at higher education levels will ensure that the Mexican population would be aware of this health problem and that the control measures adopted will have more acceptance and success. We hope that this review sensitizes the relevant authorities and that the appropriate measures to reduce the risk of infection by T. cruzi are undertaken to provide the Mexican people a better quality of life.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease, which affects an estimated 7 million to 8 million people. Chagas disease is endemic throughout Latin America, with the highest prevalence in Bolivia. Conventional diagnosis requires a well-equipped laboratory with experienced personnel. We evaluated the Chagas Detect Plus (CDP) (InBios, Seattle, WA), a rapid immunochromatographic assay for IgG antibodies to T. cruzi. CDP performance was compared to infection status based on results obtained by indirect hemagglutination assay, immunofluorescent-antibody test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Confirmed infection required positive results by at least 2 conventional assays. We used specimens from adults of both sexes in a general hospital in the city of Santa Cruz and from pregnant women in a hospital and children in villages in the Bolivian Chaco, an area of hyperendemicity. CDP was performed in paired whole-blood and serum specimens from 385 individuals in the two hospital studies and in 200 serum specimens from the community study. CDP showed sensitivities/specificities of 96.2% (95% confidence interval, 92.7 to 98.4)/98.8% (95.9 to 99.9) in whole blood and 99.3% (97.5 to 99.9)/96.9% (94.2 to 98.6) in serum, with no differences by sex, age group, or study site. CDP showed excellent sensitivity and specificity in our study population, comparable to those of conventional serology. The test is reliable for field surveys, requires no laboratory equipment, and performed well in serum and whole blood. The CDP could also be used for accurate maternal screening to identify neonates at risk of congenital transmission. CDP performance data in diverse geographic areas are needed to strengthen the evidence base for its use.

AB  - Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease that due to population movements is no longer limited to Latin America, threatens a wide spectrum of people (travellers, migrants, blood or organ recipients, newborns, adoptees) also in non-endemic countries where it is generally underdiagnosed. In Italy, the available epidemiological data about Chagas disease have been very limited up to now, although the country is second in Europe only to Spain in the number of residents from Latin American. Among 867 at-risk subjects screened between 1998 and 2010, the Centre for Tropical Diseases in Negrar (Verona) and the Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit, University of Florence found 4.2% patients with positive serology for Chagas disease (83.4% of them migrants, 13.8% adoptees). No cases of Chagas disease were identified in blood donors or HIV-positive patients of Latin American origin. Among 214 Latin American pregnant women, three were infected (resulting in abortion in one case). In 2005 a case of acute Chagas disease was recorded in an Italian traveller. Based on our observations, we believe that a wider assessment of the epidemiological situation is urgently required in our country and public health measures preventing transmission and improving access to diagnosis and treatment should be implemented.

AB  - Migration is a channel through which Chagas disease is imported, and vertical transmission is a channel through which the disease is spread in non-endemic countries. This study presents the economic evaluation of Chagas disease screening in pregnant women from Latin America and in their newborns in a non endemic area such as Spain. The economic impact of Chagas disease screening is tested through two decision models, one for the newborn and one for the mother, against the alternative hypothesis of no screening for either the newborn or the mother. Results show that the option "no test" is dominated by the option "test". The cost effectiveness ratio in the "newborn model" was 22 (sic)/QALYs gained in the case of screening and 125 (sic)/QALYs gained in the case of no screening. The cost effectiveness ratio in the "mother model" was 96 (sic)/QALYs gained in the case of screening and 1675 (sic)/QALYs gained in the case of no screening. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis highlighted the reduction of uncertainty in the screening option. Threshold analysis assessed that even with a drop in Chagas prevalence from 3.4% to 0.9%, a drop in the probability of vertical transmission from 7.3% to 2.24% and with an increase of screening costs up to (sic)37.5, "test" option would still be preferred to "no test". The current study proved Chagas screening of all Latin American women giving birth in Spain and of their infants to be the best strategy compared to the non-screening option and provides useful information for health policy makers in their decision making process.

AB  - Congenital transmission (CT) has acquired relevance in Chagas disease (CHD). A cohort of pregnant CHD women (4,355) and their babies were studied in the period 1994-2004. Children were excluded when they had received blood transfusions, or were born or had been in endemic areas; CT rate was 6.1%. Babies were diagnosed between months 1 and 5 in 68.9% of the cases and between months 6 and 12 in 31.1%. In the latter group, parasitemia was detected in 94% and serology in 74.7%. Between months 6 and 9, parasitemia diagnosed 36.2% (P = 0.000) more cases than serology. If serology had been the diagnosis method, those children would have been considered CT free. Taking the overall outcomes, 38.1% of babies were CT free, and 55.8% did not complete the follow-up. Establishing CT as a public health priority and improving first-line health service, congenital CH D coverage could be more efficient in endemic countries.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease (CD) is endemic in Central and South America, Mexico and even in some areas of the United States. However, cases have been increasingly recorded also in non-endemic countries. The estimated number of infected people in Europe is in a wide range of 14000 to 181000 subjects, mostly resident in Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Retrospective, observational study describing the characteristics of patients with CD who attended the Centre for Tropical Diseases (Negrar, Verona, Italy) between 2005 and 2013. All the patients affected by CD underwent chest X-ray, ECG, echocardiography, barium X-ray of the oesophagus and colonic enema. They were classified in the indeterminate, cardiac, digestive or mixed category according to the results of the screening tests. Treatment with benznidazole (or nifurtimox in case of intolerance to the first line therapy) was offered to all patients, excluding the ones with advanced cardiomiopathy, pregnant and lactating women. Patients included were 332 (73.9% women). We classified 68.1% of patients as having Indeterminate Chagas, 11.1% Cardiac Chagas, 18.7% as Digestive Chagas and 2.1% as Mixed Form. Three hundred and twenty-one patients (96.7%) were treated with benznidazole, and most of them (83.2%) completed the treatment. At least one adverse effect was reported by 27.7% of patients, but they were mostly mild. Only a couple of patients received nifurtimox as second line treatment.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our case series represents the largest cohort of T. cruzi infected patients diagnosed and treated in Italy. An improvement of the access to diagnosis and cure is still needed, considering that about 9200 infected people are estimated to live in Italy. In general, there is an urgent need of common guidelines to better classify and manage patients with CD in non-endemic countries.

AB  - The classical hypothesis proposes that Chagas disease has been originated in the Andean region among prehistoric people when they started domesticating animals, changing to sedentary habits, and adopting agriculture. These changes in their way of life happened nearly 6,000 years ago. However, paleoparasitological data based on molecular tools showed that Trypanosoma cruzi infection and Chagas disease were commonly found both in South and North American prehistoric populations long before that time, suggesting that Chagas disease may be as old as the human presence in the American continent. The study of the origin and dispersion of Trypanosoma cruzi infection among prehistoric human populations may help in the comprehension of the clinical and epidemiological questions on Chagas disease that still remain unanswered.

AB  - Introduction: Following advances in the control of vector and blood transfusion transmission of Chagas disease, alternative mechanisms of transmission have become more relevant. This article discusses the importance of each one of these alternative mechanisms and the measures to prevent them. Methods: A review was conducted of the scientific literature concerning alternative transmission mechanisms of Trypanosoma cruzi occurring in Brazil and the measures to prevent them. PubMed and BVS databases were consulted. Results: Twenty-five publications describing alternative mechanisms of transmission of Chagas disease were identified. Conclusions: Oral transmission, through ingestion of contaminated food items has been the most frequent mode of transmission in Brazil in recent years. Other alternative mechanisms of transmission occur less frequently. It is important to understand these occurrences, especially now that vector transmission of the parasite is under control. Preventive measures have been presented, according to each of the situations considered, in line with current knowledge.

AB  - Infectious and parasitic diseases affecting women during their reproductive age may result in vertical transmission. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence for TORSCH among pregnant women receiving care at a university hospital. Records of 574 pregnant women who received medical attention from January 2006 to December 2007 were assessed. The mean age was 27.2 +/- 6.5 years ranging from 13 to 44. The results of the immunodiagnostic tests were: 62.0% (345/556) for IgG and 3.4% (19/556) for IgM anti-T. gondii; 93.1% (433/465) for IgG and 0.6% (3/465) for IgM anti-rubella; 0.9% (5/561) for VDRL; 1.8% (10/554) for HBsAg; 0.7% (4/545) for anti-HCV and 2.1% (11/531) for HIV. In conclusion, the results of immunodiagnostic tests for the TORSCH panel among pregnant women attending a perinatal service of a university hospital are in agreement with those reported by previous studies and by governmental sources.

AB  - Chagas disease was investigated in four periurban areas of Ceara state, northeastern Brazil, through serological, parasitological and molecular methods in humans, reservoirs and vectors. A cross-sectional survey revealed a seroprevalence rate of 1.2% (13/1076 residents, six also proving positive through PCR). Trypanosoma cruzi infection was not detected in children under 10 years old. Triatoma pseudomaculata prevailed in the peridomiciles: 63 specimens, 69% (34/49) infected with trypanosomatids. Rhodnius nasutus was captured in Copernicia prunifera palm trees (n = 280; 25.0% infected with trypanosomatids) and inside dwellings (n = 8, all uninfected). Trypanosoma cruzi seropositive reservoirs, represented by Didelphis albiventris (n = 27), Rattus rattus (n = 24), Thrichomys laurentius (n = 2), Mus musculus (n = 1) and Monodelphis domestica (n = 1), were identified. Among domestic dogs (n = 96) seroprevalence reached 21.9%. Miniexon multiplex PCR assays characterized TcI in triatomines. Both TcI and TcII were detected in wild mammal hosts. We conclude that Trypanosoma cruzi circulates within a domestic zoonotic cycle, requiring continuous surveillance. Insecticide application to domiciles does not appear to prevent continuous reintroduction of wild triatomine specimens, presenting a challenge to authorities involved in Chagas disease control.

AB  - The aim of the study was to verify nutritional aspects associated with chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection among baseline participants from the Bambui cohort study on aging. The analysis included 84.9% (1,479) of residents of Bambui, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, who were 60 years or older in 1997. T. cruzi infection was investigated by three serological tests, and nutritional status was assessed by anthropometric and biochemical variables. Associations were evaluated by prevalence ratios and confidence intervals (95% CI) using Poisson regression. T. cruzi infection was present in 38.1% of patients. All anthropometric variables were significantly associated with infection, showing lower values among patients with positive serology. No biochemical variables were associated with infection. The results showed the coexistence of chronic Chagas disease and poor nutritional status in the study population, reinforcing the importance of nutritional evaluation among elderly people presenting chronic T. cruzi infection.

AB  - It is estimated that about 10 million people are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi worldwide, mostly in Latin America and more than 25 million are at risk of acquiring this infection in endemic areas. Dogs are an important reservoir for this pathogen and thus, considered a risk factor for human populations. This report describes one case of Chagas disease in a dog from Cuiaba, Mato Grosso State, Brazil. The diagnosis was obtained by direct examination of trypomastigote forms in blood smears. Amastigotes forms were visualized in microscopy of the bone marrow, lymph nodes, kidneys, liver and brain. The T. cruzi (ZIII) infection was confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction, and sequencing. The animal presented multisystemic failure and died. Although acute Chagas disease in humans is not reported in Cuiaba, this is the first report of a canine case in this region. This case represents a warning, to health professionals and authorities, to the possibility of transmission of this zoonosis in Cuiaba.

AB  - The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease. Cardiac and adipose tissues are among the early targets of infection and are sites of persistent infection. In the heart and adipose tissue, T. cruzi infection results in an upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators. In the heart, infection is associated with an increase in the markers of oxidative stress. To date, markers of oxidative stress have not been evaluated in adipose tissue in this infection. Brown and white adipose tissues were obtained from CD-1 mice infected with the Brazil strain of T. cruzi for 15, 30, and 130 days post infection. Protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation assays were performed on these samples. There was an upregulation of these markers of oxidative stress at all time-points in both white and brown adipose tissue. Determinants of anti-oxidative stress were downregulated at similar time-points. This increase in oxidative stress during T. cruzi infection most likely has a deleterious effect on host metabolism and on the heart.

AB  - Introduction: Publications are often used as a measure of success in research work. Chagas disease occurs in Central and Southern America. However, during the past years, the disease has been occurring outside Latin America due to migration from endemic zones. This article describes a bibliometric review of the literature on Chagas disease research indexed in PubMed during a 70-year period. Methods: Medline was used via the PubMed online service of the U. S. National Library of Medicine from 1940 to 2009. The search strategy was: Chagas disease [MeSH] OR Trypanosoma cruzi [MeSH]. Results: A total of 13,989 references were retrieved. The number of publications increased steadily over time from 1,361 (1940-1969) to 5,430 (20002009) (coefficient of determination for linear fit, R-2=0.910). Eight journals contained 25% of the Chagas disease literature. Of the publications, 64.2% came from endemic countries. Brazil was the predominant country (37%), followed by the United States (17.6%) and Argentina (14%). The ranking in production changed when the number of publications was normalized by estimated cases of Chagas disease (Panama and Uruguay), population (Argentina and Uruguay), and gross domestic product (Bolivia and Brazil). Conclusions: Several Latin American countries, where the prevalence of T. cruzi infection was not very high, were the main producers of the Chagas disease literature, after adjusting for economic and population indexes. The countries with more estimated cases of Chagas disease produced less research on Chagas disease than some developed countries.

AB  - Chagas disease is a complex zoonotic pathology caused by the kinetoplastid Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite presents remarkable genetic variability and has been grouped into six discrete typing units (DTUs). The association between the DTUs and clinical outcome remains unknown. Chagas disease and co-infection with HIV/AIDS has been reported widely in Brazil and Argentina. Herein, we present the molecular analyses from a Chagas disease patient with HIV/AIDS co-infection in Colombia who presented severe cardiomyopathy, pleural effusion, and central nervous system involvement. A mixed infection by T. cruzi genotypes was detected. We suggest including T. cruzi in the list of opportunistic pathogens for the management of HIV patients in Colombia. The epidemiological implications of this finding are discussed. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

AB  - Chagas disease is a major public health problem in Brazil and Latin America. During the last years, it has become an emerging problem in North America and Europe due to increasing international migration. Here we describe the prevalence of Chagas disease in Brazil through a systematic review. We searched national and international electronic databases, grey literature and reference lists of selected articles for population-based studies on Chagas disease prevalence in Brazil, performed from 1980 until September 2012. Forty-two articles with relevant prevalence data were identified from a total of 4985 references. Prevalence ranged from 0% to 25.1%. Most surveys were performed in the Northeast region, especially in the state of Piaui. We observed a high degree of heterogeneity in most pooled estimates (I-2 > 75%; p < 0.001). The pooled estimate of Chagas disease prevalence across studies for the entire period was 4.2% (95% CI: 3.1-5.7), ranging from 4.4% (95% CI: 2.3-8.3) in the 1980s to 2.4% (95% CI: 1.5-3.8) after 2000. Females (4.2%; 95% CI: 2.6-6.8), >60 year-olds (17.7%; 95% CI: 11.4-26.5), Northeast (5.0%; 95% CI: 3.1-8.1) and Southeast (5.0%; CI: 2.4-9.9) regions and mixed (urban/rural) areas (6.4%; 95% CI: 4.2-9.4) had the highest pooled prevalence. About 4.6 million (95% CI: 2.9-7.2 million) of people are estimated to be infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. The small number of studies and small-scale samples of the general population in some areas limit interpretation, and findings of this review do not necessarily reflect the situation of the entire country. Systematic population-based studies at regional and national level are recommended to provide more accurate estimates and better define the epidemiology and risk areas of Chagas disease in Brazil.

AB  - Introduction: Determining the genetic similarities among Trypanosoma cruzi populations isolated from different hosts and vectors is very important to clarify the epidemiology of Chagas disease. Methods: An epidemiological study was conducted in a Brazilian endemic area for Chagas disease, including 76 chronic chagasic individuals (96.1% with an indeterminate form; 46.1% with positive hemoculture). Results: T. cruzi I (TcI) was isolated from one child and TcII was found in the remaining (97.1%) subjects. Low-stringency single-specific-primer-polymerase chain reaction (LSSP-PCR) showed high heterogeneity among TcII populations (46% of shared bands); however, high similarities (80-100%) among pairs of mothers/children, siblings, or cousins were detected. Conclusions: LSSP-PCR showed potential for identifying similar parasite populations among individuals with close kinship in epidemiological studies of Chagas disease.

AB  - Objective: To verify the incidence of T. cruzi transmission through breastfeeding during acute experimental Chagas' disease. Methods: Fifteen female Swiss mice were mated and, after pregnancy confirmation, placed in individual cages. A few hours after birth, the females were inoculated with 0.1 mL of blood containing approximately 3 x 10(5) trypomastigote forms of Y strain of T. cruzi and continued breastfeeding for 25 days. Results: In 142 offspring examined no infection through breastfeeding was observed. Conclusions: The low number of trypomastigote forms ingested by the newborn mice combined with biological and biochemical characteristics of blood trypomastigotes may explain the lack of transmission in this experiment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Collection of triatomines in domestic, peridomestic and sylvatic environments in states of Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul, Northeastern and Southern Brazil respectively, and isolation of Trypanosoma cruzi strains.
   METHODS: First, the captured triatomines were identified using insect identification keys, then their intestinal content was examined by abdominal compression, and the samples containing trypanosomatid forms were inoculated in LIT medium and Swiss mice.
   RESULTS: Six triatomine species were collected in cities in Bahia, namely Panstrongylus geniculatus (01), Triatoma melanocephala (11), T. lenti (94), T. pseudomaculata (02), T. sherlocki (26) and T. sordida (460), and two in cities in Rio Grande do Sul, namely T. circummaculata (11) and T. rubrovaria (115). Out of the specimens examined, T. cruzi was isolated from 28 triatomine divided into four different species: T. melanocephala (one), T. lenti (one), T. rubrovaria (16) and T. sordida (10). Their index of natural infection by T. cruzi was 6.4%.
   CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of T. cruzi strains from triatomines found in domestic and peridomestic areas shows the potential risk of transmission of Chagas disease in the studied cities. The maintenance of those T. cruzi strains in laboratory is intended to promote studies that facilitate the understanding of the parasite-vector-host relationship.

AB  - Transplanted organs may act as a route of transmission of infectious diseases, such as Chagas' disease. The aim of this study was to describe the transmission of the Trypanosoma cruzi through a renal transplant and the anatomo-clinical evolution of the patient after treatment with benzonidazole. The patient was a 31-year-old white male from the State of Minas Gerais in Brazil. He had renal failure secondary to diabetes and later received a kidney from a cadaveric donor. The patient was undergoing immunosuppression therapy with azathioprine, cyclosporine A, and prednisone. After the transplant, he developed an acute phase of Chagas' disease and complications from diabetes and died 2 months later. In the autopsy, T cruzi amastigotes were found in the transplanted kidney, heart, bladder, liver, and pancreas. An important reduction in the parasitemia was obtained through the treatment of the infection with benzonidazole; however, the patient died due to complications from diabetes associated with tissue lesions caused by T cruzi.

AB  - The geographical heterogeneity of Chagas disease (ChD) is mainly caused by genetic variability of the etiological agent Trypanosoma cruzi. Our hypothesis was that the pathogenicity for mice may vary with the genetic lineage (or Discrete Typing Unit - DTU) of the parasite. To test this hypothesis, parasitological and histopathological evaluations were performed in mice inoculated with strains belonging to the DTU T. cruzi IV (TcIV) from the State of Amazonas (northern Brazil), or the DTU T. cruzi II (TcII) from the State of Parana (southern Brazil). Groups of 10 Swiss mice were inoculated with eight strains of TcIV obtained from acute cases (7) from two outbreaks of orally acquired ChD, and from the triatomine Rhodnius robustus (1) from Amazonas; and three strains of Tcll obtained from chronic patients in Parana. We evaluated the pre-patent period, patent period, maximum peak of parasitemia, day of maximum peak of parasitemia, area under the parasitemia curve, inflammatory process, and tissue parasitism in the acute phase. TcIV was less virulent than Tcll, and showed significantly (p < 0.005) lower parasitemia levels. Although the levels of tissue parasitism did not differ statistically, mice infected with TcIV displayed significantly (p <0.001) fewer inflammatory processes than mice infected with Tcll. This supported the working hypothesis, since TcIV from Amazonas was less pathogenic than Tcll from Parana; and agreed with the lower severity of human cases of ChD in the Amazon region.

AB  - Chagasic cardiomyopathy caused by Trypanosoma cruzi is a major health concern in Latin America and among immigrant populations in non-endemic areas. T cruzi has a high affinity for host lipoproteins and uses the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) for invasion. Herein, we report that T cruzi infection is associated with an accumulation of LDL and cholesterol in tissues in both acute and chronic murine Chagas disease. Similar findings were observed in tissue samples from a human case of Chagasic cardiomyopathy. T cruzi infection of cultured cells displayed increased invasion with increasing cholesterol levels in the medium. Studies of infected host cells demonstrated alterations in their cholesterol regulation. T cruzi invasion/infection via LDLr appears to be involved in changes in intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. The observed changes in intracellular lipids and associated oxidative stress due to these elevated lipids may contribute to the development of Chagasic cardiomyopathy. (C) 2014 Institut Pasteur.

AB  - Introduction: from an epidemiological point of view, more than 120 species of triatomine (Hemiptera, Reduviidae) are known. The occurrence and positivity for Trypanosoma cruzi in triatomines in 16 municipalities of the Triangulo Mineiro and Alto Paranaiba were evaluated from January 2002 to December 2004. Methods: the triatomines were captured basically according to the classic norms of the National Health Foundation. The parasitological exams of the triatomines were conducted according to the technique described by the Ministry of Health. During the study period, 990 specimens of triatomines were captured and of these, 771 could be examined. Results: five species were identified: Triatoma sordida, Panstrongylus diasi, Panstrongylus megistus, Panstrongylus geniculatus and Rhodnius neglectus. Triatoma sordida represented 71.5% of all the triatomines captured, followed by Panstrongylus megistus (18%), Rhodnius neglectus (9.3%), Panstrongylus diasi (0.8%) and Panstrongylus geniculatus (0.4%). Of the total number of triatomines examined, 2.7% were positive for Trypanosoma cruzi. Panstrongylus megistus was the species that presented the highest rates of infection by Trypanosoma cruzi (8.3%), followed by Rhodnius neglectus (2.9%) and Triatoma sordida (1.4%). Conclusions: there is a need to adapt to new circumstances in epidemiology, with greater emphasis on entomological surveillance, since the potential for adaptation of secondary species of triatomines exists, especially where Chagas' disease is already under control.

AB  - Acute Chagas disease is characterized by a systemic infection that leads to the strong activation of the adaptive immune response. Outbreaks of oral contamination by the infective protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi are frequent in Brazil and other Latin American countries, and an increased severity of clinical manifestations and mortality is observed in infected patients. These findings have elicited questions about the specific responses triggered after T. cruzi entry via mucosal sites, possibly modulating local immune mechanisms, and further impacting regional and systemic immunity. Here, we provide evidence for the existence of differential lymphoid organ responses in experimental models of acute T cruzi infection.

AB  - Recognising the importance of Chagas disease in Brazil, Bambui set up epidemiological surveillance for Chagas disease in 1974 and was the first municipality to do so. To ascertain the current epidemiology of Chagas disease in this municipality, 1.782 blood samples from the general population were analysed; 7.7% of samples were found to be seropositive for Chagas disease. A strong positive correlation between increasing age and Chagas disease was evident in both genders, with the highest prevalence in individuals aged over 60 years. Clinically, the cardiodigestive form of Chagas disease was the most common in these samples. These data confirm the interruption of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission, in parallel with a still important residual morbidity of Chagas disease in the county, thus supporting political decisions that will prioritise epidemiological surveillance and medical treatment of Chagas disease in the coming years.

AB  - In continuing our screening program of naphthoquinone activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas' disease, new beta-lapachone-based 1,2,3-triazoles, 3-arylamino-nor-beta-lapachones, 3-alkoxy-nor-beta-lapachones and imidazole anthraquinones were synthesised and evaluated against bloodstream trypomastigote forms of the parasite. Compounds 2,2-dimethyl-3-(2,4-dibromophenylamino)-2,3-dihydro-naphtho[1,2-b]furan-4,5-dione, IC50/24 h 24.9 +/- 7.4 and 4-azido-3-bromo-2,2-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[h]chromene-5,6-dione with 23.4 +/- 3.8 mu M showed a trypanosomicidal activity higher than benznidazole. These results demonstrate the potential of naphthoquinone derivatives as novel structures for the development of alternative drugs for Chagas' disease. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aiming to better understand the ecological aspects of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission cycles, wild carnivores, small mammals and dogs were examined for T. cruzi infection in the Serra da Canastra National Park region, Brazil. Isolates were genotyped using mini-exon gene and PCR-RFLP (1f8 and H3) genomic targets. Trypanosoma cruzi transmission was well established in the area and occurred in both wild and peridomestic environments. Dog seroprevalence was 29.4% (63/214) and TcI and TcII genotypes, besides mixed infections were observed. Only TcI was detected in wild mammals. Marsupials displayed lower relative abundance, but a high prevalence of positive haemocultures (4/22), whereas rodents displayed positive haemocultures (9/113) mainly in the abundant Akodon montensis and Cerradomys subflavus species. The felid Leopardus pardalis was the only carnivore to display positive haemoculture and was captured in the same region where the small mammal prevalence of T. cruzi infection was high. Two canid species, Chrysocyon brachyurus and Cerdocyon thous, were serologically positive for T. cruzi infection (4/8 and 8/39, respectively), probably related to their capacity to exploit different ecological niches. Herein, dog infection not only signals T. cruzi transmission but also the genotypes present. Distinct transmission strategies of the T. cruzi genotypes are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate maternal and fetal outcome in patients with severe left ventricle systolic dysfunction due to cardiac Chagas' disease. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of 5 pregnant women with severe systolic dysfunction due to Chagas' disease. RESULTS: The mean ejection fraction was 31.0+/-7.5%. Two patients were in the NYHA class III, and 3 in class II on presentation. Four patients had deteriorated during pregnancy. One patient presented pulmonary edema. One of the patients with class III on presentation had a good evolution during pregnancy, and the other one had preterm delivery due to worsening symptoms. There were 4 vaginal deliveries and 1 cesarean section. Small-for-gestational-age birthweight occurred in 3 pregnancies and it was not observed preterm delivery less than 36 weeks. There was no maternal or neonatal death. CONCLUSIONS: This small group presented relatively good maternal and perinatal outcome, although the great frequency of low birthweight.

AB  - We analyzed the food sources of Bolivian wild Triatoma infestans (the main vector of Chagas disease in this country), to assess the role of these populations in the epidemiological context of Chagas disease. Ninety-eight blood meals were identified by heteroduplex assay and sequencing. Most of them were from wild mammals but surprisingly 27 were from humans. This brings to light the occurrence of human-vector contacts at risk of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission in the wild environment by highly infected insects. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi genetic diversity was investigated in 25 isolates (vectors and humans) from the semi-arid zone of the State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Molecular markers (3' region of the 24S alpha rRNA; mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 (COII) gene; spliced leader intergenic region (SL-IR) gene; allelic size microsatellite polymorphism) identified 56% TcIII (100% Panstrongylus lutzi; 50% Triatoma brasiliensis); 40% TcII (91.7% humans; 50% T. brasiliensis) and 4% TcI (human). Microsatellite analysis revealed monoclonal and heterozygous patterns on one or more microsatellite loci in 64% of T. cruzi isolates (92.3% triatomines; 33.3% humans) and 36% putative polyclonal populations (66.7% humans; 7.7% triatomines) by loci SCLE10, SCLE11, TcTAT20, TcAAAT6, all belonging to TcII. Identical T. cruzi polyclonal profiles (88.9%) were detected, mostly from humans. The adaptative natural plasticity of TcII and TcIII and their potential for maintaining human infection in T. brasiliensis were confirmed. Intraspecific and phylogenetic T. cruzi diversity in the sylvatic and domestic transmission cycles in this specific region will provide exclusive control strategies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: Purification and biochemical characterization of a highly immunogenic extracellular superoxide dismutase of Trypanosome cruzi Maracay strain.
   Design and methods: Fractionation with ammonium sulphate (35-85%) and two continuous chromatography processes (ion exchange and filtration).
   Results: The molecular mass of the excreted SOD purified was 25 kDa and the isoelectric point 3.9. This enzyme was validated by ELISA with the polyclonal sera obtained from Balb-C mice and with sera from 222 chagasic patients from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru plus 20 sera corresponding to leishmaniasis from Peru. All the sera from Brazil stored since 1980 were positive, 93% were positive in chronic patients with 10 years of Chagas treatment from Chile, and 87% of the patients with pace-makers in a chronic phase from Colombia.
   Conclusions: In comparison with the IFA test, the ELISA-SODe-CRU yield was 85.59% sensitivity and specificity 100%. This method may be helpful for the diagnosis of Chagas disease. (C) 2010 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Investigation of the food source of triatomines helps in understanding the biology of these insects, and also helps to infer their importance in transmitting Trypanosoma cruzi to humans. Methods: The present study aimed to use the precipitin reaction to record the food source of triatomines from 54 municipalities in the central-western region of the State of Minas Gerais, as well as their natural infection by flagellates similar to Trypanosoma cruzi. Results: From July 2003 to March 2007, 416 insects were evaluated, all from the species Panstrongylus megistus. Among all these occurrences, birds (70%) and humans (22.5%) were the major blood sources. Sixteen (3.8%) of the insects were found to be positive for flagellates similar to Trypanosoma cruzi, and eight performed hematophagia on humans. Conclusions: The results show the need to increase the entomological surveillance in this region, given that the possibility of new cases of Chagas disease occurring through vector transmission was detected.

AB  - Objectives The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1/2, HIV-1, hepatitis B virus (HBV), Trypanosoma cruzi, Treponema pallidum and Toxoplasma gondii infections and to identify the subtypes/subgroups of HTLV-1/2 among pregnant women (PW) from non-endemic provinces of Argentina.
   Methods Methods A total of 2403 samples were screened for HTLV-1/2 and confirmed by western blot and PCR. The long terminal repeat (LTR) of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 were amplified. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by Neighbour Joining by using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis (MEGA) 4.0.
   Results Among a total of 2403 PW studied, 6 (0.25%) tested positive for HTLV-1/2 (3 HTLV-1 (0.12%) and 3 HTLV-2 (0.12%)). The total prevalence when distributed by province was 0.3% (3/804) for Buenos Aires (BA), 0.4% (1/241) for BA surroundings, 0.1% (1/707) for Neuquen and 1.0% (1/95) for Ushuaia. In San Juan, no PW were HTLV-1/2 positive. The prevalence was similar when compared with rates among blood donors of the same areas and years. The phylogenetic analysis classified one sequence as HTLV-1 aA and one as HTLV-2b. The prevalence of HIV-1, HBV, T cruzi, T pallidum and T gondii was 0.6%, 0.2%, 1.4%, 1.2% and 20.9%, respectively. One case of HTLV-1/HIV-1 and one of HTLV-2/HIV-1 co-infection were detected.
   Conclusions HTLV-1/2, which have been associated with different diseases, are circulating among PW of Argentina, even in non-endemic areas. Therefore, testing should be recommended in women who have risk factors for these infections given that the majority of HTLV-1/2 mother to child transmission can be prevented by the avoidance of breast feeding.

AB  - Introduction: The biological diversity of Tiypanosoma cruzi strains plays an important role in the clinical and epidemiological features of Chagas disease. Methods: Eight T cruzi strains isolated from children living in a Chagas disease vector-controlled area of Jequitinhonha Valley, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, were genetically and biologically characterized. Results: The characterizations demonstrated that all of the strains belonged to T cruzi II, and showed high infectivity and a variable mean maximum peak of parasitemia. Six strains displayed low parasitemia, and two displayed moderate parasitemia. Later peaks of parasitemia and a predominance of intermediate and large trypomastigotes in all T cruzi strains were observed. The mean prepatent period was relatively short (4.2 +/- 0.25 to 13.7 +/- 3.08 days), whereas the patent period ranged from 3.3 +/- 1.08 to 34.5 +/- 3.52 days. Mortality was observed only in animals infected with strain 806 (62.5%). Histopathological analysis of the heart showed that strains 501 and 806 caused inflammation, but fibrosis was observed only in animals infected with strain 806. Conclusions: The results indicate the presence of an association between the biological behavior in mice and the genetic characteristics of the parasites. The study also confirmed general data from Brazil where T cruzi II lineage is the most prevalent in the domiciliary cycle and generally has low virulence, with some strains capable of inducing inflammatory processes and fibrosis.

AB  - Background: A randomised, unblinded, clinical trial comparing two benznidazole regimens for congenital Chagas disease was carried out to determine whether simplification and reduction in the length of treatment could lead to better treatment compliance.
   Methods: This study was conducted in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Serological screening was carried out in pregnant women, and parasites were sought in the blood of newborns from seropositive mothers. Infected infants were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. Recovery was assessed by parasite seeking at 1 month and 2 months as well as serological tests at 9 months. Assessment of treatment adherence was based on weekly home visits and use of electronic monitors.
   Results: Benznidazole was given to 63 newborns in group A (5 mg/kg in two daily doses for 60 days) and 61 newborns in group B (7.5 mg/kg in a single daily dose for 30 days). There was no difference in compliance between the two groups. The study confirmed the efficacy and good tolerance of both benznidazole regimens in the treatment of congenital Chagas disease.
   Conclusions: The short treatment should be preferred as it allows reducing the dose of benznidazole as well as the cost of treatment.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the presence of Trypanosoma cruzi in blood samples of mothers with chronic Chagas disease and their newborn by conventional PCR targeted to minicircle kinetoplastidic DNA (kDNA), and to determine the lineages in mother/newborn pairs of the congenital cases by hybridization assays with probes belonging to the TcII,TcI and TcV Discrete Typing Units (DTU). In 63(57.2%) of the mothers the presence of circulating T. cruzi was demonstrated by PCR immediately before delivery and in three newborn (3%) congenital transmission was confirmed by serial PCR and conventional serology between 1 and 16 months of life, at which point treatment was started. The hybridization signals showed that two of the newborn had the same DTU as their mother (TcI, TcII and TcV), whilst in the third congenital case only TcV was detected in the cord blood, suggesting that in this infant TcI and TcII did not cross the placenta or the parasite was not present at a detectable level. Levels T. cruzi DNA was determined by TaqMan Probe based Real Time PCR assay targeted to nuclear satellite sequences in these three pairs of samples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The traditional transmission pathways of Chagas' disease are vectorial, transfusional, transplacental and organ transplantation. However, oral transmission is gaining importance. The first evidence of oral transmission was reported in Brazil in 1965. Nowadays the oral route is the transmission mode in 50% of cases in the Amazon river zone. Oral infection is produced by the ingestion of infected triatomine bugs or their feces, undercooked meat from infested host animals and food contaminated with urine or anal secretion of infected marsupials. Therefore travelers to those zones should be advised about care to be taken with ingested food. In Chile, this new mode of transmission should be considered in public health policies.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is the ethiological agent for Chagas disease in Latin America. This study aimed to test the trypanocidal effect of licarin A and burchellin isolated from plants in northeastern Brazil. These neolignans were tested on T. cruzi and on peritoneal macrophages, to evaluate drug toxicity. Epimastigote growth was inhibited in 45% with licarin A and 20% with burchellin with an IC50/96 h of 462.7 mu M and 756 mu M, respectively. Epimastigotes treated with licarin A presented swollen mitochondria and disorganized mitochondrial cristae, kDNA and Golgi complex. When treated with burchellin, they presented enormous autophagosomes and chromatin disorganization. Licarin A and burchellin were able to induce trypomastigote death with IC50/24 h of 960 mu M and 520 mu M, respectively. Although licarin A presented an IC50 for trypomastigotes higher than for epimastigotes, both substances acted as therapeutic trypanocidal agents, because they were able to kill parasites without affecting macrophages. Due to our results, burchellin and licarin A need to be further analysed to observe if they may be used as alternative blood additive prophylaxis against Chagas disease, since it has been established that blood transfusion is an important mechanism in the transmission process.

AB  - Results of Chagas' disease diagnosis show disagreement. The aim of this study was to compare commercial tests for Chagas' disease serodiagnosis in southern Brazil. A total of 161 samples were evaluated. Three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, one indirect hemagglutination and one indirect immunofluorescence were assessed. Trypomastigote excreted-secreted antigen-blot was a confirmatory method. From 161 samples, 65.84% were positive in all tests, while 34.16% presents mismatch result in at least one of the tests. All techniques tested presented false-positive and/or false-negative results as follows: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 1 had more false-positive results (lower specificity), indirect immunofluorescence had the highest rate of false-negative results (lower sensitivity), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays had fewer false-negative results (higher sensitivity), while indirect hemagglutination showed no false-positive result (higher specificity). Knowing the characteristics of techniques make it possible to combine them and obtain more reliable diagnosis. Therefore, it seems useful to combine techniques for diagnosing this infection.

AB  - A cross-sectional study was carried out in Agua Comprida, MG, Brazil, a region previously endemic to Chagas disease whose vectorial transmission was interrupted around 20 year ago. A total of 998 individuals were examined for anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies. Seropositivity was observed in 255 subjects (25.5%), and 743 subjects were negative. Forty-one families with 5-80 individuals with similar environmental conditions were selected for familial analysis. In 15 families, seropositivity to T cruzi was observed in >50% of individuals. The segregation analysis confirmed family aggregation for the seropositivity to the T cruzi. Heart commitment was the major clinical form observed, and in six families, >50% of the individuals display cardiopathy that may be attributed to T cruzi infection. Our results support the hypothesis that there is a family aggregation for the seropositivity but without the effect of one major gene.

AB  - Despite the dramatic reduction in Thypanosoma cnizi vectorial transmission in Brazil, acute cases of Chagas disease (CD) continue to be recorded. The identification of areas with greater vulnerability to the occurrence of vector-borne CD is essential to prevention, control, and surveillance activities. In the current study, data on the occurrence of domiciliated triatomines in Brazil (non-Amazonian regions) between 2007 and 2011 were analyzed. Municipalities' vulnerability was assessed based on socioeconomic, demographic, entomological, and environmental indicators using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). Overall, 2275 municipalities were positive for at least one of the six triatomine species analyzed (Panstrongylus megistus, Triatoma infestans, Triatoma brasiliensis, Triatoma pseudomaculata, Triatoma rubrovaria, and Triatoma sordida). The municipalities that were most vulnerable to vector-borne CD were mainly in the northeast region and exhibited a higher occurrence of domiciliated triatomines, lower socioeconomic levels, and more extensive anthropized areas. Most of the 39 new vector-borne CD cases confirmed between 2001 and 2012 in non-Amazonian regions occurred within the more vulnerable municipalities. Thus, MCDA can help to identify the states and municipalities that are most vulnerable to the transmission of T. cruzi by domiciliated triatomines, which is critical for directing adequate surveillance, prevention, and control activities. The methodological approach and results presented here can be used to enhance CD surveillance in Brazil. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to characterise Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) of 28 isolates of Trypanosoma cruzi from humans (15), triatomines (9), and opossums (4) in the state of Parana, southern Brazil. For this purpose, we analysed the size polymorphism at the 3' end of the 24S alpha ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) and the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the partial 5' sequence of the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase subunit II gene (COII). Band patterns of the isolates were compared with reference samples of T. cruzi I (Silvio X10 and Col 17G2), T. cruzi II (Esmeraldo and JG), T. cruzi III (222 and 231). T. cruzi IV (CAN III), T. cruzi V (SO3 cl5), and T. cruzi VI (CL Brener). Our results confirmed that rRNA analysis is of limited use for assessing T. cruzi DTUs. COII RFLP analysis was suitable for screening, but for one isolate it was necessary to determine the COII partial sequence to identify the DTU. Only one of the isolates from humans belonged to T. cnizi I; 13 isolates belonged to T. cruzi 11 and one to T. cruzi III. The four isolates from opossums and five isolates from triatomines were identified as T. cruzi I. Four isolates from triatomines showed patterns of both T. cruzi land II, indicating mixed infections. This study contributes to the characterisation of the dynamics of T. cruzi populations in southern Brazil. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The new epidemiological scenario of orally transmitted Chagas disease that has emerged in Brazil, and mainly in the Amazon region, needs to be addressed with a new and systematic focus. Belem, the capital of Para state, reports the highest number of acute Chagas disease (ACD) cases associated with the consumption of acai juice.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The wild and domestic enzootic transmission cycles of Trypanosoma cruzi were evaluated in the two locations (Jurunas and Val-de Caes) that report the majority of the autochthonous cases of ACD in Belem city. Moreover, we evaluated the enzootic cycle on the three islands that provide most of the acai fruit that is consumed in these localities. We employed parasitological and serological tests throughout to evaluate infectivity competence and exposure to T. cruzi. In Val-de-Caes, no wild mammal presented positive parasitological tests, and 56% seroprevalence was observed, with low serological titers. Three of 14 triatomines were found to be infected (TcI). This unexpected epidemiological picture does not explain the high number of autochthonous ACD cases. In Jurunas, the cases of ACD could not be autochthonous because of the absence of any enzootic cycle of T. cruzi. In contrast, in the 3 island areas from which the acai fruit originates, 66.7% of wild mammals and two dogs displayed positive hemocultures, and 15.6% of triatomines were found to be infected by T. cruzi. Genotyping by mini-exon gene and PCR-RFLP (1f8/Akw21I) targeting revealed that the mammals and triatomines from the islands harbored TcI and Trypanosoma rangeli in single and mixed infections.
   Conclusion/Significance: These findings show that cases of Chagas disease in the urban area of Belem may be derived from infected triatomines coming together with the acai fruits from distant islands. We term this new epidemiological feature of Chagas disease as "Distantiae transmission".

AB  - CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Toxoplasmosis transmission during pregnancy can cause severe sequelae in fetuses and newborns. Maternal antibodies may be indicators of risk or immunity. The aim here was to evaluate seropositivity for anti-Toxoplasma gondii (anti-T. gondii) immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and IgG avidity in pregnant women and their newborn infants.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study in a high-risk pregnancy outpatient clinic.
   METHODS: Serum samples from pregnant women (n = 87) and their respective newborns (n = 87) were evaluated for anti-T. gondii antibodies using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) (IgM and IgG), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (IgG) and an avidity test.
   RESULTS: Anti-T. gondii antibodies were identified in 64.4% of the serum samples from the mothers and their infants (56/87). Except for two maternal serum samples (2.3%), all others were negative for anti-T. gondii IgM antibodies, using IIF. The results showed that 92.9% of the pregnant women had high IgG avidity indexes (> 30%) and four samples had avidity indexes between 16 and 30%. Two women in the third trimester of pregnancy were positive for anti-T. gondii IgM antibodies; their babies had avidity indexes between 16 and 30%. The avidity indexes of serum from the other 83 newborns were similar to the results from their mothers.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that 2% of the pregnant women were at risk of T. gondii transmission during the gestational period. These data seem to reflect the real situation of gestational toxoplasmosis in the northwestern region of the state of Sao Paulo.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the interaction between Trypanosoma cruzi-1 and Triatoma brasiliensis. A group of 1st instar nymphs was initially fed on T. cruzi-infected mice and a control group was fed on uninfected mice. From the second feeding onwards, both groups were otherwise fed on non-infected mice. The resulting adults were grouped in pairs: infected male/uninfected female, uninfected male/infected female, infected male and female and uninfected male/uninfected female. The infection affected only the 1st instar nymphs, which took significantly more time to reach the 2nd instar than uninfected nymphs. The differences in the molting time between the infected and uninfected nymphs from the 2nd to the 5th instars were not statistically significant. Both groups presented similar rates of nymphal mortality and reproductive performance was not significantly affected by infection in any of the treatments.

AB  - We examined strains of Trypanosoma cruzi isolated from patients with acute Chagas disease that had been acquired by oral transmission in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil (2005) and two isolates that had been obtained from a marsupial (Didelphis aurita) and a vector (Triatoma tibiamaculata). These strains were characterised through their biological behaviour and isoenzymic profiles and genotyped according to the new Taxonomy Consensus (2009) based on the discrete typing unities, that is, T. cruzi genotypes I-VI. All strains exhibited the biological behaviour of biodeme type II. In six isolates, late peaks of parasitaemia, beyond the 20th day, suggested a double infection with biodemes II + III. Isoenzymes revealed Z2 or mixed Z1 and Z2 profiles. Genotyping was performed using three polymorphic genes (cytochrome oxidase II, spliced leader intergenic region and 24S alpha rRNA) and the restriction fragment length polymorphism of the kDNA minicircles. Based on these markers, all but four isolates were characterised as T. cruzi II genotypes. Four mixed populations were identified: SC90, SC93 and SC97 (T. cruzi I + T. cruzi II) and SC95 (T. cruzi I + T. cruzi VI). Comparison of the results obtained by different methods was essential for the correct identification of the mixed populations and major lineages involved indicating that characterisation by different methods can provide new insights into the relationship between phenotypic and genotypic aspects of parasite behaviour.

AB  - Background-Very few studies have measured disease penetrance and prognostic factors of Chagas cardiomyopathy among asymptomatic Trypanosoma cruzi-infected persons.
   Methods and Results-We performed a retrospective cohort study among initially healthy blood donors with an index T cruzi-seropositive donation and age-, sex-, and period-matched seronegatives in 1996 to 2002 in the Brazilian cities of Sao Paulo and Montes Claros. In 2008 to 2010, all subjects underwent medical history, physical examination, ECGs, and echocardiograms. ECG and echocardiogram results were classified by blinded core laboratories, and records with abnormal results were reviewed by a blinded panel of 3 cardiologists who adjudicated the outcome of Chagas cardiomyopathy. Associations with Chagas cardiomyopathy were tested with multivariate logistic regression. Mean follow-up time between index donation and outcome assessment was 10.5 years for the seropositives and 11.1 years for the seronegatives. Among 499 T cruzi seropositives, 120 (24%) had definite Chagas cardiomyopathy, and among 488 T cruzi seronegatives, 24 (5%) had cardiomyopathy, for an incidence difference of 1.85 per 100 person-years attributable to T cruzi infection. Of the 120 seropositives classified as having Chagas cardiomyopathy, only 31 (26%) presented with ejection fraction <50%, and only 11 (9%) were classified as New York Heart Association class II or higher. Chagas cardiomyopathy was associated (P<0.01) with male sex, a history of abnormal ECG, and the presence of an S-3 heart sound.
   Conclusions-There is a substantial annual incidence of Chagas cardiomyopathy among initially asymptomatic T cruzi-seropositive blood donors, although disease was mild at diagnosis. (Circulation. 2013;127:1105-1115.)

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi infection is a complex sylvatic enzooty involving a wide range of animal species. Six discrete typing units (DTUs) of T. cruzi, named TcI to TcVI, are currently recognized. One unanswered question concerning the epidemiology of T. cruzi is the distribution pattern of TcII and hybrid DTUs in nature, including their virtual absence in the Brazilian Amazon, the current endemic area of Chagas disease in Brazil. Herein, we characterized biological samples that were collected in previous epizootiological studies carried out in the Amazon Basin in Brazil. We performed T. cruzi genotyping using four polymorphic genes to identify T. cruzi DTUs: mini-exon, 1f8, histone 3 and gp72. This analysis was conducted in the following biological samples: (i) two T. cruzi isolates obtained by culturing of stools from the triatomine species Rhodnius picttipes and (ii) five serum samples from dogs in which trypomastigotes were observed during fresh blood examination. We report for the first time the presence of TcII and hybrid DTUs (TcV/TcVI) in the Amazon region in mixed infections with TcI. Furthermore, sequencing of the constitutive gene, gp72, demonstrated diversity in TcII even within the same forest fragment. These data show that TcII is distributed in the five main Brazilian biomes and is likely more prevalent than currently described. It is very probable that there is no biological or ecological barrier to the transmission and establishment of any DTU in any biome in Brazil.

AB  - The presence of acute Chagas disease (ACD) due to oral transmission is growing and expanding in several South American countries. Within the Amazon basin, the Abaetetuba municipality has been a site of recurrent cases spanning across distinct landscapes. Because Chagas disease is primarily a zoonotic infection, we compared the enzootic Trypanosoma cruzi transmission cycles in three different environmental areas of Abaetetuba to better understand this new epidemiological situation. Philander opossum was the most abundant mammalian species collected (38% of the collected mammals) with a T. cruzi prevalence of 57%, as determined by hemocultures. Didelphis inarsupialis was abundant only in the area with the higher level of environmental disturbance (approximately 42%) and did not yield detectable parasitemia. Despite similarities observed in the composition of the small mammalian fauna and the prevalence of T. cruzi infection among the studied areas, the potential of these hosts to infect vectors differed significantly according to the degree of land use (with prevalences of 5%, 41%, and 64% in areas A3, A1 and A2, respectively). Domestic mammals were also found to be infected, and one canine T. cruzi isolate was obtained. Our data demonstrated that the transmission of T. cruzi in the Amazon basin is far more complex than had been previously taught and showed that the probability of humans and domestic mammals coming into contact with infected bugs can vary dramatically, even within the same municipality. The exposure of dogs to T. cruzi infection (indicated by positive serology) was the common feature among the studied localities, stressing the importance of selecting domestic mammals as sentinels in the identification of T. cruzi transmission hotspots.

AB  - Fogo Selvagem (FS) is an autoimmune bullous disease with pathogenic IgG autoantibodies recognizing desmoglein 1 (Dsg1), a desmosomal glycoprotein. In certain settlements of Brazil, a high prevalence of FS (3%) is reported, suggesting environmental factors as triggers of the autoimmune response. Healthy individuals from endemic areas recognize nonpathogenic epitopes of Dsg1, and exposure to hematophagous insects is a risk factor for FS. Fogo selvagem and Chagas disease share some geographic sites, and anti-Dsg1 has been detected in Chagas patients. Indeterminate Chagas disease was identified in a Brazilian Amerindian population of high risk for FS. In counterpart, none of the FS patients living in the same geographic region showed reactivity against Trypanosoma cruzi. The profile of anti-Dsg1 antibodies showed positive results in 15 of 40 FS sera and in 33 of 150 sera from healthy individuals from endemic FS sites, and no cross-reactivity between Chagas disease and FS was observed.

AB  - Genetic epidemiological approaches hold great promise for improving the understanding of the determinants of susceptibility to infection with Tryponosoma cruzi and the causes of differential disease outcome in T. cruzi-infected individuals. To date, a variety of approaches have been used to understand the role of genetic factors in Chagas disease. Quantitative genetic techniques have been used to estimate the heritabilities for seropositivity for T. cruzi infection and traits that are associated with disease progression in chronic T. cruzi infection. These studies have demonstrated that a significant proportion of the variation in seropositivity and a number of traits related to Chagas disease progression is attributable to genetic factors. Candidate gene studies have provided intriguing evidence for the roles of numerous individual genes in determining cardiac outcomes in chronically infected individuals. Recent results from a long-term study of Chagas disease in a rural area of Brazil have documented that over 60% of the variation in seropositivity status is attributable to genetic factors in that population. Additionally, there are significant genetic effects on a number of electrocardiographic measures and other Chagas disease-related traits. The application of genome-wide approaches will yield new evidence for the roles of specific genes in Chagas disease.

AB  - The flagellated protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the aetiological agent of Chagas disease. Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) are enzymes that are involved in energy management and nucleoside balance in the cell. T. cruzi TcNDPK1, a canonical isoform, was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminally poly-His-tagged fusion protein and crystallized. Crystals grew after 72 h in 0.2 M MgCl2, 20% PEG 3350. Data were collected to 3.5 angstrom resolution using synchrotron X-ray radiation at the National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (Campinas, Brazil). The crystals belonged to the trigonal space group P3, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 127.84, c = 275.49 angstrom. Structure determination is under way and will provide relevant information that may lead to the first step in rational drug design for the treatment of Chagas disease.

AB  - Chagas disease, a neglected illness, affects nearly 12-14 million people in endemic areas of Latin America. Although the occurrence of acute cases sharply has declined due to Southern Cone Initiative efforts to control vector transmission, there still remain serious challenges, including the maintenance of sustainable public policies for Chagas disease control and the urgent need for better drugs to treat chagasic patients. Since the introduction of benznidazole and nifurtimox approximately 40 years ago, many natural and synthetic compounds have been assayed against Trypanosoma cruzi, yet only a few compounds have advanced to clinical trials. This reflects, at least in part, the lack of consensus regarding appropriate in vitro and in vivo screening protocols as well as the lack of biomarkers for treating parasitaemia. The development of more effective drugs requires (i) the identification and validation of parasite targets, (ii) compounds to be screened against the targets or the whole parasite and (iii) a panel of minimum standardised procedures to advance leading compounds to clinical trials. This third aim was the topic of the workshop entitled Experimental Models in Drug Screening and Development for Chagas Disease, held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on the 25th and 26th of November 2008 by the Fiocruz Program for Research and Technological Development on Chagas Disease and Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative. During the meeting, the minimum steps, requirements and decision gates for the determination of the efficacy of novel drugs for T. cruzi control were evaluated by interdisciplinary experts and an in vitro and in vivo flowchart was designed to serve as a general and standardised protocol for screening potential drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease.

AB  - We studied white-nosed coatis (Nasua narica) in Monteverde, Costa Rica to evaluate their potential as a reservoir for the vector-borne zoonotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and other selected microorganisms. We live-trapped 20 coatis in July and August 2011 and tested them for T. cruzi by blood smear, molecular analysis of blood, culture of blood and anal gland secretions, and serology. Seven coatis (35%) were polymerase-chain-reaction positive for T. cruzi and one coati was also culture positive. We did not detect T. cruzi in anal gland secretions. All coatis were positive for Myco plasma and Babesia, but were negative for Baylisascaris, Anaplasma, Candidatus Neoehrlichia lotoris, Ehrlichia, Bartonella, and several apicomplexan parasites. The possible pathogenicity of T. cruzi, Babesia, and Mycoplasma in coatis and their transmission potential to humans and domestic animals warrants further investigation.

AB  - Chagas disease is an endemic zoonosis native to the Americas and is caused by the kinetoplastid protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The parasite is also highly genetically diverse, with six discrete typing units (DTUs) reported TcI - TcVI. These DTUs broadly correlate with several epidemiogical, ecological and pathological features of Chagas disease. In this manuscript we report the most comprehensive evaluation to date of the genetic diversity of T. cruzi in Venezuela. The dataset includes 778 samples collected and genotyped over the last twelve years from multiple hosts and vectors, including nine wild and domestic mammalian host species, and seven species of triatomine bug, as well as from human sources. Most isolates (732) can be assigned to the TcI clade (94.1%); 24 to the TcIV group (3.1%) and 22 to TcIII (2.8%). Importantly, among the 95 isolates genotyped from human disease cases, 79% belonged to TcI - a DTU common in the Americas, however, 21% belonged to TcIV-a little known genotype previously thought to be rare in humans. Furthermore, were able to assign multiple oral Chagas diseases cases to TcI in the area around the capital, Caracas. We discuss our findings in the context of T. cruzi DTU distributions elsewhere in the Americas, and evaluate the impact they have on the future of Chagas disease control in Venezuela.

AB  - In 1943, the Center for the Study and Prophylaxis of Chagas Disease, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, state of Minas Gerais (MG), was created in the municipality of Bambui to carry out studies related to Chagas disease in the mid-western region of MG. Since that time, several investigations have been conducted to determine the natural habitat of triatomines, but Panstrongylus megistus colonies have never been found in this region. This paper records the first finding of a P. megistus sylvatic colony in 69 years of research. The characteristics of this ecotope and its implications for the epidemiology of Chagas disease are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND:
   A major problem in Chagas disease donor screening is the high frequency of samples with inconclusive results. The objective of this study was to describe patterns of serologic results among donors to the three Brazilian REDS-II blood centers and correlate with epidemiologic characteristics.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:
   The centers screened donor samples with one Trypanosoma cruzi lysate enzyme immunoassay (EIA). EIA-reactive samples were tested with a second lysate EIA, a recombinant-antigen based EIA, and an immunfluorescence assay. Based on the serologic results, samples were classified as confirmed positive (CP), probable positive (PP), possible other parasitic infection (POPI), and false positive (FP).
   RESULTS:
   In 2007 to 2008, a total of 877 of 615,433 donations were discarded due to Chagas assay reactivity. The prevalences (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) among first-time donors for CP, PP, POPI, and FP patterns were 114 (99-129), 26 (19-34), 10 (5-14), and 96 (82-110) per 100,000 donations, respectively. CP and PP had similar patterns of prevalence when analyzed by age, sex, education, and location, suggesting that PP cases represent true T. cruzi infections; in contrast the demographics of donors with POPI were distinct and likely unrelated to Chagas disease. No CP cases were detected among 218,514 repeat donors followed for a total of 718,187 person-years.
   CONCLUSION:
   We have proposed a classification algorithm that may have practical importance for donor counseling and epidemiologic analyses of T. cruzi-seroreactive donors. The absence of incident T. cruzi infections is reassuring with respect to risk of window phase infections within Brazil and travel-related infections in nonendemic countries such as the United States.

AB  - One century after the discovery of Chagas disease, it is still considered as a major health problem, causing more deaths in the Americas than any other parasitic disease. The northwest region of Sao Paulo, a macro-region that includes cities with a high-quality of life, has particularly high rates of Chagas disease. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the number of patients with Chagas disease, and to identify the triatomine fauna in the northwest region of Sao Paulo State, and to cytogenetically analyze Triatoma sordida mutants, thus providing new knowledge to control these species and avoid possible infections by Chagas disease. A total of 700 Chagas patients of both genders and variable age, who were born in and residents of the northwest region of the State of Sao Paulo were recruited for this study. Regarding the entoepidemiological fauna, both T. sordida and Rhodnius neglectus were captured from 2004 to 2011 in the northwest region of the Sao Paulo; however, T. sordida was the predominant species. Some of these collected triatomines were infected by Trypanosoma cruzi in several developmental stages. Furthermore, the lactoacetic orcein method was used for cytogenetic analysis. Several abnormalities were observed during meiosis of the T. sordida mutants, including condensed chromosomes with no chiasma, chromatin bridges between the autosomes, and some non-pairing homologous chromosomes. Thus, our study suggests that Chagas disease is currently not under control in Brazil. Furthermore, we suggest that cryptic speciation may be occurring in populations of T. sordida of Brazil. Further studies are necessary to understand the mechanisms behind these phenomena.

AB  - Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy evolves over a long period of time after initial infection by Trypanosoma cruzi. Similarly, a cardiomyopathy appears later in life in muscular dystrophies. This study tested the hypothesis that dystrophin levels are decreased in the early stage of T cruzi-infected mice that precedes the later development of a cardiomyopathy. CD1 mice were infected with T cruzi (Brazil strain), killed at 30 and 100 days post infection (dpi), and the intensity of inflammation, percentage of interstitial fibrosis, and dystrophin levels evaluated. Echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging data were evaluated from 15 to 100 dpi. At 30 dpi an intense acute myocarditis with ruptured or intact intracellular parasite nests was observed. At 100 dpi a mild chronic fibrosing myocarditis was detected without parasites in the myocardium. Dystrophin was focally reduced or completely lost in cardiomyocytes at 30 dpi, with the reduction maintained up to 100 dpi. Concurrently, ejection fraction was reduced and the right ventricle was dilated. These findings support the hypothesis that the initial parasitic infection-induced myocardial dystrophin reduction/loss, maintained over time, might be essential to the late development of a cardiomyopathy in mice.

AB  - Cardiac damage is a frequent manifestation of Chagas disease, which is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient, the deficiency of which has been implicated in the development of cardiomyopathy. Our group has previously demonstrated that Se supplementation prevents myocardial damage during acute T. cruzi infection in mice. In this study, we analyzed the effect of Se treatment in cases of T. cruzi infection using prevention and reversion schemes. In the Se prevention scheme, mice were given Se supplements (2 ppm) starting two weeks prior to inoculation with T. cruzi (Brazil strain) and continuing until 120 days post-infection (dpi). In the Se reversion scheme, mice were treated with Se (4 ppm) for 100 days, starting at 160 dpi. Dilatation of the right ventricle was observed in the infected control group at both phases of T. cruzi infection, but it was not observed in the infected group that received Se treatment. Surviving infected mice that were submitted to the Se reversion scheme presented normal P wave values and reduced inflammation of the pericardium. These data indicate that Se treatment prevents right ventricular chamber increase and thus can be proposed as an adjuvant therapy for cardiac alterations already established by T. cruzi infection.

AB  - Since serial studies of patients are limited, researchers interested in Chagas disease have relied on animal models of Trypanosoma cruzi infection to explore many aspects of this important human disease. These studies have been important for evaluation of the immunology, pathology, physiology and other aspects of pathogenesis. While larger animals have been employed, mice have remained the most favoured animal model, as they recapitulate many aspects of the human disease, are easy to manipulate genetically and are amenable to study by small animal imaging technologies. Further, developments in non-invasive imaging technologies have permitted the study of the same animal over an extended period of time by multiple imaging modalities, thus permitting the study of the transition from acute infection through the chronic stage and during therapeutic regimens.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the high incidence of infections after heart transplantation, there is limited information about its epidemiology in patients from countries where Chagas' disease is endemic.
   METHODS: We analyzed the occurrence of infections in 126 patients aged older than 18 years who underwent transplantation from 1986 through 2007 at a Brazilian University Hospital and who survived at least 48 hours.
   RESULTS: Heart failure diagnoses before transplantation were idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (38.6%), Chagas' disease (34.9%), coronary artery disease (19.8%), and others (6.3%). The respiratory tract was the most common site of infections (40.9%), followed by surgical wound site (18.1%). Trypanosoma cruzi reactivations occurred in, 38.8% of Chagas' disease patients: 47.0% had myocarditis, 23.5% had skin lesions, and 29.4% had both. New-onset ventricular dysfunction was observed in 47.0%, with complete response after specific treatment, and 41.0% were asymptomatic cases, diagnosed by routine endomyocardial biopsies. No patient died from such events. No differences in survival were found after 5 years of follow-up between recipients with and without Chagas' disease (p = 0.231).
   CONCLUSIONS: In a heart transplant population from a developing country, infectious complications occurred at a high rate. Tropical illnesses were uncommon, except for the high rate of Chagas' disease reactivations. Despite that, the overall outcome of these patients was similar to that of recipients with other cardiomyopathies.

AB  - Introduction: A seroepidemiological survey was carried out to evaluate Trypanosoma cruzi infection in an endemic area of the State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, involving rural residents. Methods: Sixteen municipalities were randomly selected, 15 from the west mesoregion and one from the central, with an estimated population of 83,852 individuals. A total of 1,950 blood samples were collected in the west mesoregion and 390 in Caico. Anti-T. cruzi antibodies were detected using the Chagatest (R) ELISA HAI-hemagglutination kits and indirect immunofluorescence. As sera presented indeterminate results, TESAcruzi (R) western blot was performed to confirm reactivity. Results: An estimated seroprevalence of 6.5% was determined for the west mesoregion and 3.3% for Caico. Seropositivity rises progressively with the age of individuals, up to 40 years in Caico and up to 50 years in the west mesoregion. Only educational level and knowledge regarding the triatomine were associated with seropositivity. No seroreactive individuals under 18 years of age were identified. Conclusions: Infection by T. cruzi remains high and is concentrated in municipalities in the central western area of the west mesoregion; however, evidence suggests a decline in vector transmission in this mesoregion and in Caico. Epidemiological variables appear not to influence seropositivity, with the exception of education and knowledge concerning the triatomine, among seroreactive individuals from the west mesoregion.

AB  - In congenital infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, morbidity and mortality vary from asymptomatic cases to severe clinical forms of the disease. It has been found that there is no specific clinical profile in newborns infected by T. cruzi, since during intrauterine development diverse pathological changes take place, causing alterations in the serological and parasitological profiles. Some intrinsic factors of the host, such as: the placental barrier and the ability of both, mother and fetus, to develop a specific immune response to control parasite multiplication, could be involved in such differences. Another possibility includes the genetic polymorphism of T. cruzi, since it is considered that strains of greater virulence can cross the placenta more easily and are more pathogenic to the fetus and/or the neonate.

AB  - Introduction: Trypanosoma cruzi, a flagellated protozoan, is the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, and it is estimated that approximately 5 million people in Brazil are infected with this parasite. This work aimed to compare the current diagnostic methods for Chagas disease, including conventional serological (IFAT and ELISA) and molecular techniques (PCR), to introduce PCR as an auxiliary technique. Methods: A total of 106 chagasic patients were evaluated: 88 from endemic areas of Parana, 6 from So Paulo, 3 from Minas Gerais, 3 from Rio Grande do Sul, 1 from Bahia and 5 from the Santa Catarina T cruzi outbreak. The samples were analyzed by conventional serological methods (IFAT, ELISA), hemoculture and PCR to confirm Chagas disease. Results: When IFAT was used to determine antibody levels, the sensitivity was 81.7% for patients with the cardiac form of the disease and 100% for the other clinical forms. In contrast, ELISA showed 84% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The use of serological and molecular techniques and their implications for the diagnosis of Chagas disease in non-endemics area are discussed. Conclusions: PCR constitutes an excellent support methodology for the laboratory diagnosis of Chagas disease due to its high sensitivity and specificity.

AB  - Background & aims: The occurrence of infectious disease processes during pregnancy has significant effects on maternal health and can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. The aim of the present study was to examine the potential role of zinc treatment during Trypanosoma cruzi infection in pregnant animals.
   Methods: Female Wistar rats weighing 180-200 g were used in all experiments. Production of nitric oxide, peritoneal macrophages counts, and concentrations of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were measured, and the potential protective effects of zinc on fetal development were assessed at 14-day post-infection.
   Results: Nitric oxide concentrations were higher in pregnant zinc-treated animals than in their untreated counterparts, despite similar levels of the macrophages, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Zinc therapy was associated with a significant reduction in parasitemia and cardiac parasite burden. Higher placental and birth weights were observed in animals given prenatal zinc supplementation compared to untreated animals.
   Conclusions: These data confirm the critical importance of adequate zinc intake during the peri-conceptional period and indicate that zinc has an effective role in preventing adverse outcomes of pregnancy and reducing the risk of common infections such as Chagas' disease.

AB  - Background: Outbreaks of orally transmitted Trypanosoma cruzi continue to be reported in Brazil and are associated with a high mortality rate, mainly due to myocarditis.
   Methods: This study is a detailed report on the disease progression of acute Chagas disease in 13 patients who were infected during two micro-outbreaks in two northeastern Brazilian towns. Clinical outcomes as well as EKG and ECHO results are described, both before and after benznidazole treatment.
   Results: Fever and dyspnea were the most frequent symptoms observed. Other clinical findings included myalgia, periorbital edema, headache and systolic murmur. Two patients died of cardiac failure before receiving benznidazole treatment. EKG and ECHO findings frequently showed a disturbance in ventricular repolarization and pericardial effusion. Ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction <55%) was present in 27.3% of patients. After treatment, EKG readings normalized in 91.7% of patients. Ventricular repolarization abnormalities persisted in 50% of the patients, while sinus bradycardia was observed in 18%. The systolic ejection fraction normalized in two out of three patients with initially depressed ventricular function, while pericardial effusion disappeared.
   Conclusions: Myocarditis is frequently found and potentially severe in patients with acute Chagas disease. Benznidazole treatment may improve clinical symptoms, as well as EKG and ECHO findings.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is an important cause of morbidity and mortality primarily resulting from cardiac dysfunction, although T. cruziin fection results in inflammation and cell destruction in many organs. We found that T. cruzi (Brazil strain) infection of mice results in pancreatic inflammation and parasitism within pancreatic beta-cells with apparent sparing of a cells and leads to the disruption of pancreatic islet architecture, beta-cell dysfunction, and surprisingly, hypoglycemia. Blood glucose and insulin levels were reduced in infected mice during acute infection and insulin levels remained low into the chronic phase. In response to the hypoglycemia, glucagon levels 30 days postinfection were elevated, indicating normal a-cell function. Administration of L-arginine and a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist (CL316, 243, respectively) resulted in a diminished insulin response during the acute and chronic phases. Insulin granules were docked, but the lack of insulin secretion suggested an inability of granules to fuse at the plasma membrane of pancreatic beta-cells. In the liver, there was a concomitant reduced expression of glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA and glucose production from pyruvate (pyruvate tolerance test), demonstrating defective hepatic gluconeogenesis as a cause for the T. cruzi-induced hypoglycemia, despite reduced insulin, but elevated glucagon levels.

AB  - In order to verify the Trypanosoma cruzi infection in domestic domiciled dogs in a rural endemic area from the south region of the State of Bahia, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) were performed using S35 and S36 primers in 272 dogs living in the district of Vila Operaria, in the municipality of Buerarema. All animals were clinically evaluated; 2.5 mL of blood were collected through venipuncture for the performance of molecular tests. None of these animals showed clinical signs of the illness and only two were identified with the DNA parasite. This result is the first report of natural infection by T. cruzi in domestic dogs in southern Bahia.

AB  - Chagas' disease, produced by the haemoflagellated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), is one of the most frequent endemic diseases in Latin America. In spite that in the past few years T. cruzi congenital transmission has become of epidemiological importance, studies about this mechanism of infection are scarce.
   The placental tissue undergoes apoptosis throughout gestation, as part of its normal turnover. On the other hand, it is known that T cruzi induces, delays or inhibits apoptosis in other mammalian tissues. In order to determine the effect of parasite invasion on normal apoptosis in the placenta, explants of human chorionic villi were incubated with 105 trypomastigotes for 24 h. Effective infection was tested by visualizing T cruzi antigens in histological preparations and by PCR. Upon infection, apoptotic cell death was determined by light and transmission electron microscopy, TUNEL analysis, measurement of caspase-3 like activity and immunohistochemical detection of caspase 3 cleaved cytokeratin 18. Our results clearly show that T cruzi induces apoptosis in the chorionic villi and suggest that this is one of mechanisms used by the parasite to insure infection and invasion of human placenta and fetus.

AB  - Introduction: Panstrongylus megistus is commonly found in wild environments of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The aim of this study was to characterize the network of refuges used by triatomine in a forest fragment of Porto Alegre and to identify Trypanosoma cruzi infection, associated hosts and the epidemiological importance of both hosts and triatomines. Methods: Techniques including the spool-and-line method and active searching (transects) were used to identify natural foci. Results: The food source for each triatomine was determined using the precipitin test, and the infection of marsupials was determined by xenodiagnosis. A total of 33 adults (domestic environment) and 27 nymphs (wild environment) of P rnegistus were found in addition to 43 Didelphis albiventris specimens. The infection rates of triatomine adults, triatomine nymphs and opossums with T cruzi I were 64%, 73% and 69%, respectively. Birds, rodents and opossums were the main resources used by triatomine. Conclusions: This work presents the first characterization of a natural focus of? megistus in Rio Grande do Sul. The natural characteristics of this focus and its implication in the transmission of T cruzi are discussed.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease in the Amazon region is considered an emerging anthropozoonosis with a predominance of the discrete typing units (DTUs) TcI and TcIV. These DTUs are responsible for cases of acute disease associated with oral transmission. Chronic disease cases have been detected through serological surveys. However, the mode of transmission could not be determined, or any association of chronic disease with a specific T. cruzi DTU's. The aim of this study was to characterize Trypanosoma cruzi in patients with chronic Chagas disease in the State of Amazonas, Brazil.
   Methods: Blood culture and xenodiagnosis were performed in 36 patients with positive serology for Chagas disease who participated in a serological survey performed in urban and rural areas of Manaus, Amazonas. DNA samples were extracted from the feces of triatomines used for xenodiagnosis, and the nontranscribed spacer of the mini-exon gene and the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) were amplified by PCR and sequenced.
   Results: Blood culture and xenodiagnosis were negative in 100% of samples; however, molecular techniques revealed that in 13 out of 36 (36%) fecal samples from xenodiagnosis, T. cruzi was characterized as the DTU TcI, and different haplotypes were identified within the same DTU.
   Conclusion: The DTU TcI, which is mainly associated with acute cases of Chagas disease in the Amazon region, is also responsible for chronic infection in patients from a region in the State of Amazonas.

AB  - Chagas disease induces a strong immune response and L-arginine is an essential amino acid which plays an important role in homeostasis of the immune system. The aims of this study were to evaluate parasitemia, corticosterone levels, production of nitric oxide (NO), fetal morphological measurements, and histology of heart and placenta. Twenty pregnant Wistar rats (180-220 g) were grouped in: pregnant control (PC), pregnant control and L-arginine supplied (PCA), pregnant infected (PI), pregnant infected and L-arginine supplied (PIA). Females were infected with 1 x 10(5) trypomastigotes of the Y strain (3rd day of pregnancy). Animals were supplied with 21 mg of L-arginine/kg/day during 14 days. PIA showed significant decreased levels of corticosterone and parasitemia. For control groups, any alteration in NO production was found with L-arginine supplementation; for PIA, enhanced nitrite concentrations were observed as compared to PI. Weights and lengths of fetuses were higher in L-arginine treated and infected pregnant rats as compared to untreated ones. Placental weight from the PIA group was significantly increased when compared to PI. In l-arginine treated animals, cardiac tissue showed reduced amastigote burdens. PIA and PI displayed similar placental parasitism. Based on these results,L-arginine supplementation may be potentially useful for the protection against Trypanosoma cruzi during pregnancy.

AB  - Introduction: The present study shows a descriptive analysis of triatomine occurrence and its natural Trypanosoma infection rates in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, between 2006 and 2007. Methods: Entomological data for the species, such as specimens captured in both intra and peridomiciles and natural infection index, were obtained via domiciliary capture in 147 municipalities from 11 Regional Managements of Health. The database was obtained from a sample of insects (100% infected and 20% non-infected) sent to the Central Laboratory of Pernambuco. Results: A total of 18,029 triatomines were analyzed from 138 municipalities of the state. Triatoma pseudomaculata (35%), Triatoma brasiliensis (34%), and Panstrongylus lutzi (25%) were the most captured species. These species also showed a widespread geographical distribution in the state. Panstrongylus megistus, Triatoma petrocchiae, Triatoma melanocephala, Triatoma sordida, Rhodnius nasutus, Rhodnius neglectus, and Triatoma infestans showed more limited geographical distribution and lower relative abundance. The parasitological research showed that 8.8% of the triatomines were naturally infected with flagellates morphologically similar to Trypanosoma cruzi and 91.3% of them were captured inside houses in 113 municipalities. P. lutzi showed the highest rates of natural infection. Conclusions: After the control of T. infestans, synanthropic species, such as T. brasiliensis, T. pseudomaculata, and P. lutzi, maintain the risk of T. cruzi transmission to humans in the state of Pernambuco. These species are widely distributed, and infected specimens have been found inside houses. Thus, an enhanced surveillance and vector control of Chagas disease is recommended in Pernambuco.

AB  - Introduction: Rhodnius neglectus is a triatomine that colonizes different palm species. In this study, we aimed to describe the presence of this triatomine bug in the royal palms (Roystonea oleracea) in a rural region of the State of Goias. Methods: Palm infestation was investigated by dissecting the palms or by using live-bait traps. Results: Two palm trees were infested by R. neglectus negative for Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent for Chagas disease. In the study area, R. neglectus is frequently found in households. Conclusions: The adaptation of this species to palm trees introduced in Brazil for landscaping purposes poses another challenge for controlling the vectors of Chagas disease.

AB  - P>Chagas' disease is an emerging and neglected disease in the Brazilian Amazon region, where T. cruzi I predominates among the acute cases of the disease; and T. cruzi III/Z3, a population cluster from sylvatic areas of the Amazon basin, is rarely associated with human infections. On 23rd April 2007, the Foundation for Health Surveillance of the State of Amazonas, Brazil reported an outbreak of acute Chagas disease in the municipality of Coari on the Solimoes River banks. Fresh blood examination confirmed the infection in 25 patients. Parasite culture in LIT medium was successful for 18 isolates. Molecular characterization was performed by PCR of the non-transcribed spacer of the mini-exon and by sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII) gene. The T. cruzi isolates were all from genotype Z3, and sequencing revealed that all isolates had equal COII sequences compatible with TcIII type, suggesting a single source of infection. To our knowledge, this is the first outbreak of acute cases caused uniquely by the genotype TcIII/Z3. Wild vectors harbouring TcIII stocks contribute to transmission when the triatomine species reaches human food chain or when humans invade the forest environment, where sylvatic cycle constitutes a reservoir of parasites that might be associated with specific epidemiological and clinical traits of the emergent Chagas disease in the Amazon.

AB  - In Venezuela six episodes of oral transmission of Chagas disease (OChD) have been described, being the one reported in 2007 with a total of 103 people infected the largest worldwide. This work shows the use of three molecular markers (mini-exon gene and domains 24S alpha and 18S of the ribosomal RNA) to characterize the infecting Trypanosoma cruzi strain of patients, reservoirs and vectors involved in five of the six OChD outbreaks. For this, 28 T. cruzi isolates were characterized by PCR, and the products of these reactions cloned and sequenced to reveal the existence of different TcI SL-IR genotypes. We also describe a new PCR assay able to discriminate between TcIb and TcId parasite populations. In summary, we have identified mostly parasites with the TcId haplotype and multiclonal populations with predominance of haplotype TcId (65.2%). Additionally, populations of haplotypes TcIb, TcIa and mixtures (TcId + TcIb, TcId + TcIa, TcIb + TcIa) are recurrent in samples obtained from children. The analysis of the SL-IR motif showed two clones depicting a different motif that could be an evidence for a possible hybrid haplotype between TcIa and TcIb (haplotype TcIa/Ib). Interestingly, in a single patient haplotype differences between T.cruzi isolates obtained pre and post-treatment were found. In conclusion, our findings show that in order to understand the pathogenic mechanisms involved in the orally adquired Chagas disease there is a need to join efforts to study T. cruzi haplotypes, their tissue tropisms and their susceptibility to chemoteaphy.

AB  - Even though the Chagas' disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, was described 100 years ago by Carlos Chagas, it still represents a major public health concern and is found in 18 developing countries in South and Central America. In Brazil, Benznidazole (Rochagan) is the only drug with trypanocidal activity available in the market, despite its several side effects and limited efficacy in the chronic phase of the infection. In view of the need for new substances displaying biological activity against T. cruzi, there has been growing interest in research toward the attainment of compounds capable of acting on the parasite while being devoid of serious side effects. In this context, this study aims to evaluate the in vivo therapeutic activity of dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans (-)-cubebin and (-)-hinokinin during the acute phase of infection by T. cruzi. As a study criterion, animals with acute parasitemia were investigated by tissue morphometric analysis. There was significant parasitemia reduction in the groups of animals treated with (-)-cubebin or (-)-hinokin oral administration, compared to the negative control. Values close to those of the uninfected control were found in the groups treated with (-)-cubebin and (-)-hinokinin via kariometry, showing that there was positive cellular response compared to the infected control.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate, through blood culture and PCR, the results of the ELISA for Chagas' disease in the screening of blood donors in the public blood-supply network of the state of Parana, Brazil, and to map the epidemiological profile of the donors with respect to their risk of infection by Trypanosoma cruzi. The negative and positive results of the ELISA were confirmed by blood culture and PCR for 190/191 individuals (99.5%). For one individual (0.5%), the ELISA was inconclusive, blood culture and IIF were negative, and IHA and PCR positive. Three individuals (1.6%) were positive for T.cruzi on all the tests. Donors were predominantly female, and natives of Parana, of rural origin, had observed or been informed of the presence of the vector in the municipalities where they resided, had never received a blood transfusion, had donated blood 1 to 4 times, and reported no cases of Chagas' disease in their families. We concluded that PCR and blood culturing have excellent potential for confirming the results of the ELISA, and that candidate blood donors with negative or positive tests have a similar risk of infection by T.cruzi, indicating that the ELISA test is sufficiently safe for screening blood prior to use.

AB  - Little is known about the importance of capybara. Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, as reservoirs for parasites of zoonotic or veterinary importance. Sera from 63 capybaras, from 6 counties in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, were examined for antibodies to Trypanosoma cruel, Leishmania infantum, Encephalitozoon cuniculi. Sarcacystis neurona, and Neospora caninum using an indirect immunofluorescent antibody test. Five (8%) of the 63 capybaras had antibodies to T cruzi epimastigotes. None of the samples from capybara reacted positively with L. infantum promastigotes or with spores of E. cuniculi. Two (3%) of the serum samples were positive for antibodies to S. neurona merozoites, and 2 (3%) of the serum samples were positive for antibodies to N. caninum tachyzoites. A serum sample from 1 capybara was positive for antibodies to both T cruzi and N. caninum. None of the remaining 62 samples reacted with more than 1 parasite.

AB  - Introduction: Studies on mortality due to parasitic diseases such as Chagas disease are useful to understand the epidemiology and to plan and guide control measures for these diseases. We analyzed mortality trends due to Chagas disease in Brazil and regions, between 1979 and 2009.
   Methodology: Mortality data (underlying cause of death) were obtained from the nationwide Mortality Information System (SIM) of the Ministry of Health. We calculated crude mortality rates and rates standardized by age, as well as proportional mortality.
   Results: In total, 27,560,043 deaths occurred in the study period. In 172,066 deaths, Chagas disease was mentioned as the underlying cause (proportional mortality: 0.62%). The mean crude and age-standardized mortality rates were 3.61 and 5.19 deaths/100,000 inhabitants/year, respectively. During the observation period, Chagas mortality declined significantly at the national level (R-2=97%, p<0.001), with different patterns between regions. There was a significant reduction in mortality in the Central-West (R-2=90%, p<0.001), Southeast (R-2=98%, p<0.001) and South (R-2=94%, p<0.001), but in the North (R-2=34%, p=0.001) and Northeast (R-2=65%, p<0.001) regions mortality increased.
   Conclusions: Despite the overall decline in mortality due to Chagas disease in Brazil, it remains an important public health problem. After successful control of the primary vector Triatoma infestans, intervention measures must focus on improved access to health care and secondary prevention. The North and Northeast regions, where vectors other than T. infestans have a primary role, need special attention.

AB  - The seroprevalence of Chagas disease in humans and the presence of triatomines were investigated in a rural locality in the State of Ceara, Brazil, an historically endemic region. Approximately 80% of the surveyed residents agreed to undergo serological tests. Intradomestic and peridomestic environments were searched for triatomines in both the dry and rainy seasons. The prevalence rate of Chagas disease was 1.2% and the majority of individuals confirmed with the disease over 50 years of age. A total of 761 specimens of triatomines were captured, most of which were from colonies composed of nymphs and adult bugs, and the majority of specimens were obtained in the dry season. Triatoma brasiliensis was the predominant species. Analysis using light microscopy revealed that 28.6% of the insects were Trypanosoma cruzi positive. Results suggest that peridomestic man-made structures, such as animal shelters, improper storage of timber and uninhabited dwellings contribute to the high rate of triatomine infestation in the area.

AB  - Introduction: Studies on Chagas disease deal with the perspective of its occurrence in the Amazon region, which is directly correlated to the population growth and the spread of the bug biotope. The state of Rondonia has an immense source of vectors (Triatomine) and reservoirs of Trypanosoma cruzi. Environmental changes brought forth by the deforestation in the region may cause vector behavior changes and bring these vectors to a closer contact with humans, increasing the probability of vector infection. Methods: This study was carried out to check the occurrence of Chagas disease in the municipality of Monte Negro, Rondonia, Brazil, based on a random sampling of the farms and people wherein blood collection from the population and capturing triatomines were done. The blood samples were submitted to serologic tests to detect antibodies of the IgG class against T. cruzi. The triatomines that were collected had their digestive tract checked for the presence of trypanosomatidae with morphology resembling that of the T. cruzi. Results: The population examined was mostly from other states. From the 322 bugs examined on the microscope, 50% showed parasites with morphology compatible with T. cruzi. From the serology of 344 random samples of human blood, 1.2% was found positive, 6% showed inconclusive results, and 92.8% were negative. Conclusions: Monte Negro shows low prevalence of human infection by T. cruzi and none active vector transmission; however, preventive and surveying measures, which are not performed until now, shall be taken due to the abundance of vectors infected by trypanosomatidae.

AB  - The cardiovascular manifestations of Chagas disease are well known. However, the contribution of the vasculature and specifically the microvasculature has received little attention. This chapter reviews the evidence supporting the notion that alterations in the microvasculature especially in the heart contribute to the pathogenesis of chagasic cardiomyopathy. These data may also be important in understanding the contributions of the microvasculature in the aetiologies of other cardiomyopathies. The role of endothelin-1 and of thromboxane A(2) vascular spasm and platelet aggregation is also discussed. Further, these observations may provide target(s) for intervention.

AB  - Introduction: The biological diversity of circulating Trypanosoma cruzi stocks in the Amazon region most likely plays an important role in the peculiar clinic-epidemiological features of Chagas disease in this area. Methods: Seven stocks of T. cruzi were recently isolated in the State of Amazonas, Brazil, from humans, wild mammals, and triatomines. They belonged to the TcI and Z3 genotypes and were biologically characterized in Swiss mice. Parasitological and histopathological parameters were determined. Results: Four stocks did not promote patent parasitemia in mice. Three stocks produced low parasitemia, long pre-patent periods, and a patent period of 1 day or oscillating parasitemia. Maximum parasitemia ranged from 1,400 to 2,800 trypomastigotes/0.1mL blood. Mice inoculated with the T. cruzi stocks studied showed low positivity during fresh blood examinations, ranging from 0% to 28.6%. In hemoculture, positivity ranged from 0% to 100%. Heart tissue parasitism was observed in mice inoculated with stocks AM49 and AM61. Stock AM49 triggered a moderate inflammatory process in heart tissue. A mild inflammatory process was observed in heart tissue for stocks AM28, AM38, AM61, and AM69. An inflammatory process was frequently observed in skeletal muscle. Examinations of brain tissue revealed inflammatory foci and gliosis in mice inoculated with stock AM49. Conclusions: Biological and histopathological characterization allowed us to demonstrate the low infectivity and virulence of T. cruzi stocks isolated from the State of Amazonas.

AB  - Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) initiates complement on Trypanosoma cruzi through the MBL-associated serine protease 2 (MASP2). We haplotyped six MASP2 polymorphisms in 208 chronic chagasic patients, being 81 indeterminate and 123 symptomatic (76 with cardiac, 19 with digestive and 28 with cardiodigestive forms) and 300 healthy individuals from Southern Brazil, using PCR with sequence-specific primers. The g.1961795C, p.371D diplotype (short CD) occurred at a higher frequency among symptomatic patients, compared with the indeterminate group (P-Bf = 0.012, OR = 3.11), as well as genotypes with CD, but not with the g.1945560A in the promoter in cardiac patients (P-Bf = 0.012, OR = 13.54). CD haplotypes linked to the p.P126L and p.V377A variants were associated with reduced MASP-2 levels (P<0.0001) but not reduced MBL/MASP-2/C4 complexes. MASP2*CD genotypes, most of them generating low MASp-2 levels, are associated with high risk of chagasic cardiomyopathy. Rapid MASP2 genotyping Might be used to predict the risk of symptomatic disease. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - All species of Triatominae are susceptible to infection by Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) and consequently, potential insect vectors of Chagas disease. Currently, there are 140 known species of triatomine bugs, which can be grouped into specific species complexes. The species Triatoma lenti ( Hemiptera: Triatominae) is found only in Brazil and is considered a potential vector of Chagas disease. We karyotyped male T. lenti and examined its spermatogenesis in detail. The karyotype was found to be 2n = 20A + XY, demonstrating that this organism has the modal chromosome set found in triatomines. This new information concerning males of this species contributed to biological data that will be useful for understanding this potentially important Chagas disease vector.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi infection in humans and experimental animals causes Chagas disease which is often accompanied by myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and vasculopathy. T. cruzi-derived thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) modulates vasculopathy and other pathophysiological features of Chagasic cardiomyopathy. Here, we provide evidence that epimastigotes, trypomastigotes, and amastigotes of T. cruzi (Brazil and Tulahuen strains) express a biologically active prostanoid receptor (PR) that is responsive to TXA(2) mimetics, e.g. IBOP. This putative receptor, TcPR, is mainly localized in the flagellar membrane of the parasites and shows a similar glycosylation pattern to that of bona fide thromboxane prostanoid (TP) receptors obtained from human platelets. Furthermore, TXA(2)-PR signal transduction activates T. cruzi-specific MAPK pathways. While mammalian TP is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR); T. cruzi genome sequencing has not demonstrated any confirmed GPCRs in these parasites. Based on this genome sequencing it is likely that TcPR is unique in these protists with no counterpart in mammals. TXA(2) is a potent vasoconstrictor which contributes to the pathogenesis of Chagasic cardiovascular disease. It may, however, also control parasite differentiation and proliferation in the infected host allowing the infection to progress to a chronic state.

AB  - Background and Purpose-Previous case-control studies have suggested a causal link between Chagas disease, which is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, and stroke. We investigated the relationship between Chagas disease and long-term stroke mortality in a large community-based cohort of older adults.
   Methods-Participants were 1398 (80.3% from total) residents aged >= 60 years in Bambui City, Brazil. The end point was death from stroke. Potential confounding variables included age, sex, conventional stroke risk factors, and high sensitive C-reactive protein.
   Results-Participants of this study were followed from 1997 to 2007 leading to 9740 person-years of observation. The baseline prevalence of T. cruzi infection was 37.5% and the overall mortality rate from stroke was 4.62 per 1000 person-years. The risk of death from stroke among T. cruzi-infected participants was twice that of those noninfected (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.25 to 4.44). A B-type natriuretic peptide level in the top quartile was a strong and independent predictor of stroke mortality among those infected (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.25 to 5.91). The presence of both a high B-type natriuretic peptide level and electrocardiographic atrial fibrillation increased the risk of stroke mortality by 11.49 (95% CI, 3.19 to 41.38) in these individuals.
   Conclusions-This study provides new evidence supporting a causal link between Chagas disease and stroke. The results also showed that B-type natriuretic peptide alone or in association with atrial fibrillation has prognostic value for stroke mortality in T. cruzi chronically infected older adults.

AB  - Introduction: The co-infection Trypanosoma cruzi/HIV has been described as a clinical event of great relevance. The objective of this study was to describe clinical and epidemiological aspects published in literature. Methods: It is a systematic review of a descriptive nature from the databases Medline, Lilacs, SciELO, Scopus, from 1980 to 2010. Results: There were 83 articles (2.8 articles/year) with a total of 291 cases. The co-infection was described in 1980 and this situation has become the defining AIDS clinical event in Brazil. This is the country with the highest number of publication (51.8%) followed by Argentina (27.7%). The majority of cases are amongst adult men (65.3%) native or from endemic regions with serological diagnosis in the chronic stage (97.9%) and indeterminate form (50.8%). Both diseases follow the normal course, but in 41% the reactivation of the Chagas disease occurs. The most severe form is the meningoencephalitis, with 100% of mortality without specific and early treatment of the T. cruzi. The medication of choice was the benznidazole on doses and duration normally used for the acute phase. The high parasitemia detected by direct or indirect quantitative methods indicated reactivation and its elevation is the most important predictive factor. The lower survival rate was related to the reactivation of the Chagas disease and the natural complications of both diseases. The role of the antiretroviral treatment on the co-infection cannot yet be defined by the knowledge currently existent. Conclusions: Despite the relevance of this clinical event there are still gaps to be filled.

AB  - Some Latin American countries have plans for total control and/or eradication of Chagas disease by the main vector (Triatoma infestans) and by blood transfusion. To achieve this, patients with Chagas disease must be identified. A Western blotting test, TESAcruzi, is described as a supplemental test for diagnosis of Chagas disease using samples collected from children <5 years living in different states of Brazil. Blood samples collected by finger prick on filter paper were sent to the test laboratory by a central laboratory to confirm results obtained previously. Ten percent of negative samples, all doubtful and all positive samples were received. Commercial reagents, IgG indirect immunofluorescence, enzyme immunoassay, and a recently introduced TESAcruzi test were used. From 8788 samples, 163 (1.85%) were reactive by IgG-ELISA and 312 (3.55%) by IgG IIF. From these, 77 (0.87%) were reactive in the TESAcruzi test. The results had high clinical value to identify those truly infected. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A study of aggregate data collected from the literature and official sources was undertaken to estimate expected and observed prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, annual incidence of congenital transmission and rate of underdiagnosis of Chagas disease among Latin American migrants in the nine European countries with the highest prevalence of Chagas disease. Formal and informal data sources were used to estimate the population from endemic countries resident in Europe in 2009, diagnosed cases of Chagas disease and births from mothers originating from endemic countries. By 2009, 4,290 cases had been diagnosed in Europe, compared with an estimated 68,000 to 122,000 expected cases. The expected prevalence was very high in undocumented migrants (on average 45% of total expected cases) while the observed prevalence rate was 1.3 cases per 1,000 resident migrants from endemic countries. An estimated 20 to 183 babies with congenital Chagas disease are born annually in the study countries. The annual incidence rate of congenital transmission per 1,000 pregnancies in women from endemic countries was between none and three cases. The index of underdiagnosis of T. cruzi infection was between 94% and 96%. Chagas disease is a public health challenge in the studied European countries. Urgent measures need to be taken to detect new cases of congenital transmission and take care of the existing cases with a focus on migrants without legal residency permit and potential difficulty accessing care.

AB  - Political repression and/or economic stagnation stimulated the flow of migration from the 17 Latin American countries endemic for Chagas disease to developed countries. Because of this migration, Chagas disease, an autochthonous disease of the Continental Western Hemisphere is becoming a global health problem. In 2006, 3.8% of the 80,522 immigrants from those 17 countries to Australia were likely infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. In Canada in 2006, 3.5% of the 156,960 immigrants from Latin America whose country of origin was identified were estimated to have been infected. In Japan in 2007, there were 80,912 immigrants from Brazil, 15,281 from Peru, and 19,413 from other South American countries whose country of origin was not identified, a portion of whom may have been also infected.
   In 15 countries of Europe in 2005, excluding Spain, 2.9% of the 483,074 legal Latin American immigrants were estimated to be infected with T. cruzi. By 2008, Spain had received 1,678,711 immigrants from Latin American endemic countries; of these, 5.2% were potentially infected with T. cruzi and 17,390 may develop Chagas disease. Further, it was estimated that 24-92 newborns delivered by South American T. cruzi infected mothers in Spain may have been congenitally infected with T. cruzi in 2007. In the USA we estimated that 1.9% of approximately 13 million Latin American immigrants in 2000, and 2% of 17 million in 2007, were potentially infected with T. cruzi. Of these, 49,157 and 65,133 in 2000 and 2007 respectively, may have or may develop symptoms and signs of chronic Chagas disease.
   Governments should implement policies to prevent donations of blood and organs from T. cruzi infected donors. In addition, an infrastructure that assures detection and treatment of acute and chronic cases as well as congenital infection should be developed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the histopathological alterations of the placenta provoked by maternal infection during pregnancy by different Trypanosoma cruzi strains. Pregnant mice, 60 day-old, were i. p. inoculated with 2 x 10(5) bloodstream trypomastigotes of colombian, Y, Bolivia or RC strains of T. cruzi. The results demonstrated that the Bolivia and RC strains showed higher histotropism for the mouse placental cells than the colombian or Y strains. The inflammatory process in all the infected groups involved the basal decidua, but the colombian strain caused intense decidual degeneration, with rare or absent inflammatory cells. Placentas from all the infected groups displayed aereas of edema, degeneration, necrosis and calcification, mainly in the basal decidua, but the group infected by the RC strain showed also involvement of the spongiotrophoblast. The highest parasitism was observed with the Bolivia and RC strains, involving all the placenta zones, including the trophoblast giant cells and the spongiotrophoblast. The results show that placentas undergo differentiated pathological processes, characteristic for each strain.

AB  - This study aimed to contribute to our knowledge of the parasite-vector interaction associated with Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas, 1909) infection in Panstrongylus megistus (Burmeister, 1835), an important vector of Chagas' disease in Brazil. The prevalence and intensity of T. cruzi infection, the incidence of metacyclogenesis and the frequency of nuclear phenotypes in Malpighian tubules were investigated in nymphs of P. megistus, reared at 28 degrees C and subjected to heat shock (40 degrees C, 1 hour) two days after infection with T. cruzi II (Y strain). Following the 45-day post-infection period, the frequency of epimastigotes was much higher than that of trypomastigotes in both heat-shocked and non-shocked insects, and the prevalence of infection was not altered by heat shock. Fewer epimastigotes and trypomastigotes were found in the infected insects subjected to the heat shock, indicating that the multiplication and metacyclogenesis of the parasites were affected by the stress. In infected specimens heat shock promoted an increased frequency of cell nuclei with heterochromatin decondensation, a cell survival response to stress, and did not affect insect survival. The effects of infection and heat shock, especially on the multiplication and metacyclogenesis of T. cruzi, and the observed resistance to heat shock developed by P. megistus nymphs are suggestive that they should be considered when adequate conditions for rearing these infected insects in the laboratory are pursued.

AB  - The high prevalence of chagasic blood donors in blood centers in Brazil (6.9%) and in Latin America (6.5%) in the 60's and 70's, together with the combat to the vector since the 70's have made transfusion Chagas disease the main mechanism of the disease transmission in the 80's. However, the highly favorable results achieved to eliminate the vector and the serologic screening of blood donors, reduced the prevalence of serum positivity to 0.2% and 1.3%, respectively and the rate of annual transmission through blood transfusion from 20.000 to 13 in four decades in Brazil. Nevertheless, despite outstanding advancements in endemic countries, Chagas disease reached, via migration, non-endemic countries in North America and Europe besides Japan and Australia, placing their blood recipients at risk and turning Chagas disease into a worldwide health problem. Transfusion safety through serologic selection raised another big issue i.e. high proportion of inconclusive reactions as well as two great challenges: the meaning of such exams and what guidelines to provide the donor. However, the strategies adopted by non-endemic countries and the advancements achieved by endemics so far forecast the highly wished vector and transfusion control of Chagas disease.

AB  - A new epidemiological scenario involving the oral transmission of Chagas disease, mainly in the Amazon basin, requires innovative control measures. Geospatial analyses of the Trypanosoma cruzi transmission cycle in the wild mammals have been scarce. We applied interpolation and map algebra methods to evaluate mammalian fauna variables related to small wild mammals and the T. cruzi infection pattern in dogs to identify hotspot areas of transmission. We also evaluated the use of dogs as sentinels of epidemiological risk of Chagas disease. Dogs (n = 649) were examined by two parasitological and three distinct serological assays. kDNA amplification was performed in patent infections, although the infection was mainly sub-patent in dogs. The distribution of T. cruzi infection in dogs was not homogeneous, ranging from 11-89% in different localities. The interpolation method and map algebra were employed to test the associations between the lower richness in mammal species and the risk of exposure of dogs to T. cruzi infection. Geospatial analysis indicated that the reduction of the mammal fauna (richness and abundance) was associated with higher parasitemia in small wild mammals and higher exposure of dogs to infection. A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) demonstrated that species richness and positive hemocultures in wild mammals were associated with T. cruzi infection in dogs. Domestic canine infection rates differed significantly between areas with and without Chagas disease outbreaks (Chi-squared test). Geospatial analysis by interpolation and map algebra methods proved to be a powerful tool in the evaluation of areas of T. cruzi transmission. Dog infection was shown to not only be an efficient indicator of reduction of wild mammalian fauna richness but to also act as a signal for the presence of small wild mammals with high parasitemia. The lower richness of small mammal species is discussed as a risk factor for the re-emergence of Chagas disease.

AB  - A survey for seroprevalence of Chagas disease was held in a representative sample of Brazilian individuals up to 5 years of age in all the rural areas of Brazil, with the single exception of Rio de Janeiro State. Blood on filter paper was collected from 104,954 children and screened in a single laboratory with two serological tests: indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme linked immunoassay. All samples with positive or indetermined results, as well as 10% of all the negative samples were submitted to a quality control reference laboratory, which performed both tests a second time, as well as the western blot assay of TESA (Trypomastigote Excreted Secreted Antigen). All children with confirmed final positive result (n = 104, prevalence = 0.1%) had a follow-up visit and were submitted to a second blood collection, this time a whole blood sample. In addition, blood samples from the respective mothers and familiar members were collected. The infection was confirmed in only 32 (0.03%) of those children. From them, 20 (0.025%) had maternal positive results, suggesting congenital transmission; 11 (0.01%) had non-infected mothers, indicating a possible vectorial transmission; and in one whose mother had died the transmission mechanism could not be elucidated. In further 41 visited children the infection was confirmed only in their mothers, suggesting passive transference of maternal antibodies; in other 18, both child and mother were negative; and in 13 cases both were not localized. The 11 children that acquired the infection presumably through the vector were distributed mainly in the Northeast region of Brazil (States of Piaui, Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba and Alagoas), in addition to one case in Amazonas (North region) and another in Parana (South region). Remarkably, 60% of the 20 cases of probably congenital transmission were from a single State, Rio Grande do Sul, with the remaining cases distributed in other states. This is the first report demonstrating regional geographical differences in the vertical transmission of Chagas disease in Brazil, which probably reflects the predominant Trypanosoma cruzi group IId and IIe (now TcV and TcVI) found in this state. Overall, these results show that the regular and systematic control programs against the transmission of Chagas disease, together with socioeconomic changes observed in Brazil in the last decades, interrupted the vectorial transmission in Brazil, resumed in the few cases found in this national survey. Furthermore they reinforce the need for maintenance of control programs for the consolidation of this major advance in public health.

AB  - Background: The rising number of acute cases of Chagas disease in the State of Para, reported in the past two decades, has been associated, in part, with the ingestion of juice of local palm tree fruits, mainly acai berry and bacaba. Near the study area, in Santarem, Para State, an outbreak of Chagas disease has been notified and investigations suggest the consumption of bacaba juice as the main source of infection with T. cruzi. The purpose of this study is to assess the aspects associated to the ecology of Rhodnius robustus in palm trees of three communities of the Tapajos region, in the State of Para, Brazil.
   Methods: Palm trees were cut down and dissected to search for triatomines. DNA from triatomines was extracted to investigate natural infection by Trypanosoma cruzi and T. rangeli. For statistical analyzes, data from infestation of palm trees, as well as the rates of natural infection by T. cruzi and T. rangeli were compared by Chi-square test. Triatomine density values were analyzed by the nonparametric Kruskal Wallis test and then comparisons between each pair of variables were made by the Mann-Whitney test assuming a confidence interval of 95%.
   Results: We dissected 136 palm trees, 60 at the end of the rainy period and 76 at the end of the dry period. Seventy-three of them (53.7%) were infested with triatomines and three species were found, namely: Rhodnius robustus, Rhodnius pictipes and Panstrongylus lignarius. We collected 743 triatomines, and R. robustus was predominant (n = 739). The identification of natural infection of the insects by trypanosomatids revealed that 125 triatomines were infected by T. cruzi, 69 by T. rangeli and 14 presented both parasites, indicating the presence of mixed infection in the same vector.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that Sao Tome is the community with greater density of triatomines and infestation of palm trees; also, it demonstrates the existence of an intense sylvatic cycle in the region, which demands intensive surveillance to prevent human transmission.

AB  - Adult triatomines occasionally fly into artificially lit premises in Amazonia. This can result in Trypanosoma cruzi transmission to humans either by direct contact or via foodstuff contamination, but the frequency of such behaviour has not been quantified. To address this issue, a light-trap was set 45 m above ground in primary rainforest near Manaus, state of Amazonas, Brazil and operated monthly for three consecutive nights over the course of one year (432 trap-hours). The most commonly caught reduviids were triatomines, including 38 Panstrongylus geniculatus, nine Panstrongylus lignarius, three Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus, five Rhodnius robustus, two Rhodnius pictipes, one Rhodnius amazonicus and 17 Eratyrus mucronatus. Males were collected more frequently than females. The only month without any catches was May. Attraction of most of the known local T. cruzi vectors to artificial light sources is common and year-round in the Amazon rainforest, implying that they may often invade premises built near forest edges and thus become involved in disease transmission. Consequently, effective Chagas disease prevention in Amazonia will require integrating entomological surveillance with the currently used epidemiological surveillance.

AB  - Mice carrying a defective leptin receptor gene (db/db mice) are metabolically challenged and upon infection with Trypanosoma cruzi (Brazil strain) suffer high mortality. In genetically modified db/db mice, (NSE-Rb db/db mice), central leptin signaling is reconstituted only in the brain, which is sufficient to correct the metabolic defects. NSE-Rb db/db mice were infected with T. cruzi to determine the impact of the lack of leptin signaling on infection in the absence of metabolic dysregulation. Parasitemia levels, mortality rates, and tissue parasitism were statistically significantly increased in infected db/db mice compared with those in infected NSE-Rb db/db and FVB wild-type mice. There was a reduction in fat mass and blood glucose level in infected db/db mice. Plasma levels of several cytokines and chemokines were statistically significantly increased in infected db/db mice compared with those in infected FVB and NSE-Rb db/db mice. These findings suggest that leptin resistance in individuals with obesity and diabetes mellitus may have adverse consequences in T. cruzi infection.

AB  - Introduction: More than a century after its discovery, Chagas disease still remains a public health problem with major challenges to the health systems of endemic countries. Brazil has made progress towards control, but different major challenges remain. This article discusses the potential role of operational research to address the challenges of integrating care and control of Chagas disease within the Brazilian Unified Health System. Methods: Based on the concept of operational research and on the scenarios of Chagas disease in Brazil, an analysis and review are performed of the role of this type of research as a strategy for strengthening health systems. Results: We identified aspects of program management, disease surveillance, control, diagnosis, treatment, prevention & rehabilitation, and education & communication. These actions must be integrated into initiatives promoting comprehensive care, where quality of care for people living with Chagas disease in all its clinical forms and surveillance are closely related, with the ideal opportunity for developing a primary health care network. Conclusions: Operational research maybe an effective tool for strengthening health surveillance within the Brazilian Unified Health System to improve quality and effectiveness of control of Chagas disease. The mobilization and integration of different stakeholders (program management, academic institutions, health workers, NGOs, social movement) extends its feasibility and sustainability.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in Latin America. There are no vaccines available, the chemotherapy used to treat this illness has serious side effects and its efficacy on the chronic phase of disease is still a matter of debate. In a search for alternative treatment for Chagas disease, essential oils extracted from traditional medicinal plants Lippia sidoides, Lippia origanoides, Chenopodium ambrosioides, Ocimum gratissimum,Justicia pectorales and Vitex agnus-castus were investigated in vitro for trypanocidal and cytotoxic activities. Essential Oils were extracted by hydrodistillation and submitted to chemical analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The concentration of essential oils necessary to inhibit 50% of the epimastigotes or amastigotes growth (IC50) and to kill 50% of trypomastigote forms (LC50) was estimated. The most prevalent chemical constituents of these essential oils were monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. All essential oils tested demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the parasite growth and survival. L. sidoides and L. origanoides essential oils were the most effective against trypomastigote and amastigote forms respectively. No significant cytotoxic effects were observed in mouse peritoneal macrophages incubated with essential oils which were more selective against the parasites than mammalian cells. Taken together, our results point towards the use of these essential oils as potential chemotherapeutic agent against T. cruzi. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Survival In Vitro and Virulence of Trypanosoma cruzi in Acai Pulp in Experimental Acute Chagas Disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION
LA  - English
KW  - TRANSMISSION
AB  - Chagas disease is a parasitic infection with high socioeconomic impact throughout Latin America. Although this severe, incurable disease can be transmitted by several routes, oral transmission is currently the most important route in the Amazon Basin. Acai pulp has nutritional properties and is popular throughout Brazil and abroad. However, this pulp has been associated with microepidemics of acute Chagas disease (ACD) in northern Brazil, where agar fruit is the main food supplement. In this study, we examined the in vitro survival and in vivo virulence of Trypanosoma cruzi Y strain in acai pulp. Aliquots of in natura acai pulp produced in Belem city in the northern Brazilian state of Para were mixed with 10(5) trypomastigotes. The samples were incubated at room temperature or at 4 or 20 C for various periods, and the parasites were isolated by forced sieving. The resulting eluates were examined by microscopy, and the trypomastigotes were administered intraperitoneally, orally, or by gavage to immunodeficient mice (C.B-17-Prkdc(scid)/PasUnib) that had been pretreated with antibiotics. Parasitemia was quantified by the Brener method, and mortality was recorded daily. All routes of administration resulted in ACD. A 5-day delay in the onset of parasitemia occurred with oral administration. The survival and virulence of the parasites were unaffected by prior incubation at room temperature for 24 h, at 4 degrees C for 144 h, and at -20 degrees C for 26 h. These results indicate that T. cruzi can survive and retain its virulence in acai pulp under various conditions and that cooling and freezing are not suitable methods for preventing foodborne ACD.

AB  - CECIERJ is a state public foundation focused in education. It includes CEDERJ arm, which is specialized in teaching at distance as university. Our group has developed an intense work producing multimedia material to undergraduate students in Biology. The aim of this work was to develop educational materials in the graphical version using three-dimensional (3D) animations, to visualize the morphology, dynamic processes and basic knowledge of the Cell Biology as a whole and here, in special of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Parasitic protozoa are important agents of human and veterinary diseases not only in Brazil but also all over the world. The life cycle of this protozoan is presented in different levels of education, from fundamental school to graduation level. Videos and animations include: cell division, endocytosis and flagellar beating; the interaction of the parasite with a vertebrate host cell and the behaviour of this protozoan in the digestive tract of the invertebrate host. Thus, this material could: (1) facilitate the learning and teaching of cell biology of parasites, (2) provide good material that can be used by several people at different levels, such as lectures, classes, research, thesis, etc.

AB  - The biological behaviour of 23 Trypanosoma cruzi isolates in Swiss mice was compared. Nineteen isolates were obtained from patients in the acute phase of Chagas disease (13), sylvatic reservoir hosts (Didelphis marsupialis) (3), and triatomine bugs (Rhodnius robustus) (3) from four regions of the State of Amazonas (AM). Four isolates were obtained from chronic chagasic patients in the State of Parana (PR): three autochthones, and one allochthone from the State of Minas Gerais. Only one isolate was unable to infect the mice. The AM and PR isolates showed the largest number of significant differences from each other. The former had lower mean values in the pre-patent (5.4 days) and patent (4.6 days) periods (PP), with the parasitaemia (Pmax) reaching a peak of 9.9 x 10(4) blood trypomastigotes (BT)/mL of blood by the 7th day following inoculation. The AM isolates also had higher positivity to fresh-blood examination (FBE) (84.1%) compared to haemoculture (HC) (58.7%) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (33.3%), in addition to higher mortality (2.9%). The PR isolates had higher values for PP (18.5 days) and Pmax (99.9 X 10(4) BT/mL) as well as higher positivity to FBE (87.2%), HC (100%), and PCR (83.3%). The correlations between the biological behaviour of the T. cruzi isolates and the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of Chagas disease are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, in March, 2006, the death of a six-year-old boy from the municipality of Itaporanga was notified to the Center for Epidemiological Survey of the Silo Paulo State Health Secretariat: an autochthonous case of acute Chagas disease. The postmortem histopathological examination performed in the Hospital das Clinicas of the Botucatu School of Medicine confirmed the diagnosis. Reference to hospital records, consultation with the health professionals involved in the case and interviews with members of the patient's family supplied the basis for this study. We investigated parasite route of transmission, probable local reservoirs and vectors. No further human cases of acute Chagas disease were diagnosed. No locally captured vectors or reservoirs were found infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. Alternative transmission hypotheses - such as the possible ingestion of foods contaminated with vector excreta - are discussed, as well as the need to keep previously endemic regions and infested houses under close surveillance. Clinicians should give due attention to such signs as uni- or bilateral palpebral edema, cardiac failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, anasarca and atypical signs of nephrotic syndrome or nephritis and consider the diagnostic hypothesis of Chagas disease.

AB  - The epidemiological situation of Chagas disease in Brazil was substantially altered in the last decades, partially as a consequence of the control measures implemented and partially due to the environmental, economical and social changes that took place in the country. Domicile vector transmission was interrupted when caused by Triatoma infestans and importantly controlled when associated with native species of the vector. Transfusion transmission is no longer a problem since generalized screening of blood donors came into routine. Congenital transmission, although still possible, mainly in some areas, also tends to disappear due to the control in the vector and transfusion transmission. The primordial mechanisms of transmission directly related to the enzootic cycle, as the one caused by vectors outside the homes, or by sporadic entrance of vectors in the domicile, in addition to the oral transmission, started to become relevant in the generation of new infections by Trypanosoma cruzi. The new challenges in facing Chagas disease include: a) to preserve the excellent level of control that was achieved; b) to develop new technologies and methods of surveillance and control capable of reducing the risk of cases associated to enzootic transmission; c) to provide adequate medical attention to patients with the infection or the disease in its chronic stage.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, is an important cause of cardiovascular disease. It is increasingly clear that parasite-derived prostaglandins potently modulate host response and disease progression. Here, we report that treatment of experimental T. cruzi infection (Brazil strain) beginning 5 days post infection (dpi) with aspirin (ASA) increased mortality (2-fold) and parasitemia (12-fold). However, there were no differences regarding histopathology or cardiac structure or function. Delayed treatment with ASA (20 mg/kg) beginning 60 dpi did not increase parasitemia or mortality but improved ejection fraction. ASA treatment diminished the profile of parasite-and host-derived circulating prostaglandins in infected mice. To distinguish the effects of ASA on the parasite and host bio-synthetic pathways we infected cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) null mice with the Brazil-strain of T. cruzi. Infected COX-1 null mice displayed a reduction in circulating levels of thromboxane (TX)A(2) and prostaglandin (PG)F-2 alpha. Parasitemia was increased in COX-1 null mice compared with parasitemia and mortality in ASA-treated infected mice indicating the effects of ASA on mortality potentially had little to do with inhibition of prostaglandin metabolism. Expression of SOCS-2 was enhanced, and TRAF6 and TNF alpha reduced, in the spleens of infected ASA-treated mice. Ablation of the initial innate response to infection may cause the increased mortality in ASA-treated mice as the host likely succumbs more quickly without the initiation of the "cytokine storm'' during acute infection. We conclude that ASA, through both COX inhibition and other "off-target'' effects, modulates the progression of acute and chronic Chagas disease. Thus, eicosanoids present during acute infection may act as immunomodulators aiding the transition to and maintenance of the chronic phase of the disease. A deeper understanding of the mechanism of ASA action may provide clues to the differences between host response in the acute and chronic T. cruzi infection.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease is a systemic pathology caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. This parasite reveals remarkable genetic variability, evinced in six Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) named from T. cruzi I to T. cruzi VI (TcI to TcVI). Recently newly identified genotypes have emerged such as TcBat in Brazil, Colombia and Panama associated to anthropogenic bats. The genotype with the broadest geographical distribution is TcI, which has recently been associated to severe cardiomyopathies in Argentina and Colombia. Therefore, new studies unraveling the genetic structure and natural history of this DTU must be pursued.
   Results: We conducted a spatial and temporal analysis on 50 biological clones of T. cruzi I (TcI) isolated from humans with different clinical phenotypes, triatomine bugs and mammal reservoirs across three endemic regions for Chagas disease in Colombia. These clones were submitted to a nuclear Multilocus Sequence Typing (nMLST) analysis in order to elucidate its genetic diversity and clustering. After analyzing 13 nuclear housekeeping genes and obtaining a 5821 bp length alignment, we detected two robust genotypes within TcI henceforth named TcIDOM (associated to human infections) and a second cluster associated to peridomestic and sylvatic populations. Additionaly, we detected putative events of recombination and an intriguing lack of linkage disequilibrium.
   Conclusions: These findings reinforce the emergence of an enigmatic domestic T. cruzi genotype (TcIDOM), and demonstrates the high frequency of recombination at nuclear level across natural populations of T. cruzi. Therefore, the need to pursue studies focused on the diferential virulence profiles of TcI strains. The biological and epidemiological implications of these findings are herein discussed.

AB  - B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a diagnostic and prognostic tool in heart failure and also in Chagas disease, which is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and has cardiomyopathy as a main feature. BNP lipolytic actions and T. cruzi infection in the adipose tissue have been recently described. We aim to investigate the relationship between BNP and anthropometric measures and whether it is influenced by T. cruzi infection. We measured BNP, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), triceps skin-fold thickness (TSF) and performed serological, biochemical and electrocardiographic exams in 1398 subjects (37.5% infected with T. cruzi) in a community-dwelling elderly population in Bambui city, Brazil. Linear multivariate regression analysis was performed to investigate determinants of BNP levels. BNP levels were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in T. cruzi-infected subjects than in the non-infected group (median = 121 and 64 pg/mL, respectively). BMI, WC and TSF in infected subjects were significantly lower than those in non-infected subjects (24.3 vs. 25.5 kg/m2; 89.2 vs. 92.4 cm: and 14.5 vs. 16.0 mm, respectively). There was an inverse relationship between BNP levels and BMI (b = -0.018), WC (b = -0.005) and TSF (b = -0.193) levels. Infected and non-infected groups showed similar inverse relationships between BNP and BMI (b = -0.021 and b = -0.015, respectively). In conclusion, there was an inverse relationship between BNP levels and the anthropometric measures. Despite the actions in the adipose tissue, T. cruzi infection did not modify the associations between BNP and BMI, suggesting that body mass does not modify the accuracy of BNP in Chagas disease.

AB  - Chagas disease, or American Trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which is in turn transmitted by blood-sucking insects of the subfamily Triatominae (family Reduviidae). Because no drugs or vaccines are available to cure Chagas disease in its chronic phase, vectorial control (i.e., insecticide spraying) constitutes the principal means by which to impair Chagas disease transmission. Environmental and social factors have caused changes in the epidemiology of this disease it was originally restricted to Latin America, but is now becoming a global heath concern in non-endemic areas as a consequence of human migrations. In Brazil, despite the fact that the most effective vector has been controlled, other triatomine species infest and colonize domiciliary habitats and can transmit the pathogen. As a consequence, Chagas disease transmission continues: the prevalence of the disease remains at 12 million people, with 200,000 new cases per year in 15 countries of Latin America, making control actions still necessary. Understanding the environmental requirements and geographic distributions of vectors is key to guiding control measures, and understanding better epidemiologic aspects of the disease. Ecologic niche modeling is a relatively new tool that permits such insights as a consequence, here, we present an overview of insights gained using this approach in understanding of Chagas disease.

AB  - Many proteins of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, contain characteristic arrays of highly repetitive immunogenic amino acid motifs. Diagnostic tests using these motifs in monomeric or dimeric form have proven to provide markedly improved specificity compared to conventional tests based on crude parasite extracts. However, in many cases the available tests still suffer from limited sensitivity. In this study we produced stable synthetic genes with maximal codon variability for the four diagnostic antigens, B13, CRA, TcD, and TcE, each containing between three and nine identical amino acid repeats. These genes were combined by linker sequences encoding short proline-rich peptides, giving rise to a 24-kDa fusion protein which was used as a novel diagnostic antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay setup. Validation of the assay with a large number of well-characterized patient sera from Bolivia and Brazil revealed excellent diagnostic performance. The high sensitivity of the new test may allow future studies to use blood collected by finger prick and dried on filter paper, thus dramatically reducing the costs and effort for the detection of T. cruzi infection.

AB  - Background: Heart disease progression occurs in 30% of patients with chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Supplementation with selenium (Se) in animal model of T. cruzi infection produced promising results. There is evidence that patients with Chagas heart disease have lower Se levels than healthy individuals and patients with T. cruzi infection without of cardiac disease. The aim of this investigation is to estimate the effect of Se treatment on prevention of heart disease progression in patients with chagasic cardiopathy.
   Methods: The Selenium Treatment and Chagasic Cardiopathy trial is a superiority, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. The eligibility criteria are as follows: (1) a Chagas disease diagnosis confirmed by serology; (2) segmental, mild or moderate global left ventricular systolic dysfunction; and (3) age between 18 and 65 years. The exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) pregnancy, (2) diabetes mellitus, (3) tobacco use, (4) alcohol abuse, (5) evidence of nonchagasic heart disease, (6) depression, (7) dysphagia with evidence of food residues in the esophagus, (8) dysphagia with weight loss higher than 15% of usual weight in the last four months and/or (9) conditions that may result in low protocol adherence. The intervention will be 100 mu g of sodium selenite once daily for 365 consecutive days compared to placebo. The following are the primary outcomes to be measured: (1) the trajectories of the left ventricular ejection fraction in the follow-up period; (2) reduction of heart disease progression rates, with progression defined as a 10% decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction; and (3) rate of hospital admissions attributable to dysrhythmia, heart failure or stroke due to Chagas disease. One hundred thirty patients will be randomly allocated into either the intervention or placebo group at a ratio of 1:1. The sequence allocation concealment and blinding were planned to be conducted with the strategy of numbered boxes. Both patients and health-care providers will remain blinded to the intervention groups during the 5 years of follow-up.
   Discussion: If Se treatment reduces the progression of Chagas cardiopathy, the inclusion of this micronutrient in the daily diet can improve the therapeutic regimen for this neglected tropical disease at low cost.

AB  - Introduction. A seroepidemiological and clinical study was conducted on 152 autochthonous individuals living in the district of Barcelos, State of Amazonas, to evaluate the seroprevalence of Chagas infection and morbidity of Chagas disease. Methods. The serological tests used were indirect immunofluorescence, conventional and recombinant ELISA and immunoblot (Tesa-blot). Thirty-eight patients were considered seropositive; 31 were considered serodoubtful; and 83 were considered seronegative. The 38 seropositive cases were paired with 38 seronegative controls of the same age and sex, and underwent epidemiological and clinical evaluations, electrocardiograms and echocardiograms. Twenty-nine pairs underwent radiological examinations of the esophagus. Results. Seropositivity was 19.9 times more frequent among workers gathering plant materials from the forests and 10.4 times more frequent among piassaba gatherers. Eighty six point seven percent of the seropositive individuals recognized the genus Rhodnius as the local vector, while only 34.2% of the seronegative individuals recognized this. The EKG was abnormal in 36.8% of the seropositive individuals and in 21.5% of the seronegative individuals, while the echocardiogram showed abnormalities in 31.6% of the seropositive and 18.4% of the seronegative individuals. Precordialgia and palpitation were more frequent among the seropositive individuals. Clinical evaluation on the digestive system and X-ray on the esophagus did not show significant abnormalities. Conclusions. Chagas disease in the study region can be considered to be an occupational disease.

AB  - With the control of the vectorial and transfusional routes of infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, congenital transmission has become an important source of new cases. This study evaluated the efficacy of trypanocidal therapy to prevent congenital Chagas disease and compared the clinical and serological evolution between treated and untreated infected mothers. We conducted a multicenter, observational study on a cohort of mothers infected with T. cruzi, with and without trypanocidal treatment before pregnancy. Their children were studied to detect congenital infection. Among 354 "chronically infected mother-biological child'' pairs, 132 were treated women and 222 were untreated women. Among the children born to untreated women, we detected 34 infected with T. cruzi (15.3%), whose only antecedent was maternal infection. Among the 132 children of previously treated women, no infection with T. cruzi was found (0.0%) (p<0.05). Among 117 mothers with clinical and serological follow up, 71 had been treated and 46 were untreated. The women were grouped into three groups. Group A: 25 treated before 15 years of age; Group B: 46 treated at 15 or more years of age; Group C: untreated, average age of 29.2 +/- 6.2 years at study entry. Follow-up for Groups A, B and C was 16.3 +/- 5.8, 17.5 +/- 9.2 and 18.6 +/- 8.6 years respectively. Negative seroconversion: Group A, 64.0% (16/25); Group B, 32.6% (15/46); Group C, no seronegativity was observed. Clinical electrocardiographic alterations compatible with chagasic cardiomyopathy: Group A 0.0% (0/25); B 2.2% (1/46) and C 15.2% (7/46). The trypanocidal treatment of women with chronic Chagas infection was effective in preventing the congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi to their children; it had also a protective effect on the women's clinical evolution and deparasitation could be demonstrated in many treated women after over 10 years of follow up.

AB  - Introduction: Acucena Municipality, Rio Doce Valley, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil temporarily (2001-2005) interrupted epidemiological surveillance for Chagas disease. The objective of this work was to evaluate the Chagas Disease Control Program (CDCP) in Acucena and to offer suggestions for improving local epidemiological surveillance. Methods: This study was conducted in three phases: I) a serological investigation of schoolchildren aged 5 to 15 years using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test performed on blood collected on filter paper followed by ELISA, indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and indirect hemaglutination (IHA) on venous blood for borderline cases and those in the gray zone of reactivity; II) vector evaluation using the data obtained by local health agents during 2006-2010; and III) examination by ELISA, IIF and IHA of serum samples from the inhabitants of houses where infected Triatoma vitticeps was found and evaluation of their knowledge about Chagas disease. Results: Five individuals had inconclusive results in the ELISA screening but were seronegative for Chagas disease. The triatomine evaluation revealed the presence of three species: Triatoma vitticeps, Panstrongylus megistus and Panstrongylus diasi. Triatoma vitticeps was the most prevalent and widespread, with a higher (67%) index of Trypanosoma cruzi flagellates and evidence of colonization. Most of the inhabitants of the infested houses recognized triatomines and had basic knowledge about Chagas disease. Conclusions: Although T. vitticeps is not clearly associated with Chagas disease transmission, these results highlight the importance of maintaining CDCP in endemic areas and the need for greater emphasis on epidemiological surveillance, especially in areas with important vectorial changes or that have been modified by human intervention.

AB  - Background: Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida, Trypanosomatidae) infection is an ancient and widespread zoonosis distributed throughout the Americas. Ecologically, Brazil comprises several distinct biomes: Amazonia, Cerrado, Caatinga, Pantanal and the Atlantic Forest. Sylvatic T. cruzi transmission is known to occur throughout these biomes, with multiple hosts and vectors involved. Parasite species-level genetic diversity can be a useful marker for ecosystem health. Our aims were to: investigate sylvatic T. cruzi genetic diversity across different biomes, detect instances of genetic exchange, and explore the possible impact of ecological disturbance on parasite diversity at an intra-species level.
   Methods: We characterised 107 isolates of T. cruzi I (TcI; discrete typing unit, DTU I) from different major Brazilian biomes with twenty-seven nuclear microsatellite loci. A representative subset of biologically cloned isolates was further characterised using ten mitochondrial gene loci. We compared these data generated from Brazilian TcI isolates from around America.
   Results: Genetic diversity was remarkably high, including one divergent cluster that branched outside the known genetic diversity of TcI in the Americas. We detected evidence for mitochondrial introgression and genetic exchange between the eastern Amazon and Caatinga. Finally, we found strong signatures of admixture among isolates from the Atlantic Forest region by comparison to parasites from other study sites.
   Conclusions: Atlantic Forest sylvatic TcI populations are highly fragmented and admixed by comparison to others around Brazil. We speculate on: the possible causes of Atlantic Forest admixture; the role of T. cruzi as a sentinel for ecosystem health, and the impact disrupted sylvatic transmission cycles might have on accurate source attribution in oral outbreaks.

AB  - Background: Familial aggregation of Chagas cardiac disease in T. cruzi-infected persons suggests that human genetic variation may be an important determinant of disease progression.
   Objective: To perform a GWAS using a well-characterized cohort to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes associated with cardiac outcomes.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study was developed by the NHLBI REDS-II program in Brazil. Samples were collected from 499 T. cruzi seropositive blood donors who had donated between 1996 and 2002, and 101 patients with clinically diagnosed Chagas cardiomyopathy. In 2008-2010, all subjects underwent a complete medical examination. After genotype calling, quality control filtering with exclusion of 20 cases, and imputation of 1,000 genomes variants; association analysis was performed for 7 cardiac and parasite related traits, adjusting for population stratification.
   Results: The cohort showed a wide range of African, European, and modest Native American admixture proportions, consistent with the recent history of Brazil. No SNPs were found to be highly (P<10(-8)) associated with cardiomyopathy. The two mostly highly associated SNPs for cardiomyopathy (rs4149018 and rs12582717; P-values <10(-6)) are located on Chromosome 12p12.2 in the SLCO1B1 gene, a solute carrier family member. We identified 44 additional genic SNPs associated with six traits at P-value <10(-6) : Ejection Fraction, PR, QRS, QT intervals, antibody levels by EIA, and parasitemia by PCR.
   Conclusion: This GWAS identified suggestive SNPs that may impact the risk of progression to cardiomyopathy. Although this Chagas cohort is the largest examined by GWAS to date, (580 subjects), moderate sample size may explain in part the limited number of significant SNP variants. Enlarging the current sample through expanded cohorts and meta-analyses, and targeted studies of candidate genes, will be required to confirm and extend the results reported here. Future studies should also include exposed seronegative controls to investigate genetic associations with susceptibility or resitance to T. cruzi infection and non-Chagas cardiomathy.

AB  - Hundred years after the discovery of Chagas' disease, there is a lack of effective treatment to control this neglected disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The transmission is primarily through vector-borne blood transfusion or during pregnancy, producing high mortality and morbidity among poor people in many countries of Latin America. In the last decades, the efforts have been focused mainly on the elimination of vectors. At the same time, screening of blood donors in order to avoid transfusional transmission has been improved all over the world. However, Chagas' disease is still a major public health problem, with estimates of nearly 90 million people at risk of infection and more than eight million infected in 18 endemic countries. Despite the high incidence in endemic regions and the dissemination of neglected diseases in North America and Europe, to date, there are only two drugs developedn and prescribed for the treatment of Chagas' disease, nifurtimox (tablets of 120 mg) and benznidazole (tablets of 100mg). In this review, different approaches carried out in the last decades for developing novel pharmaceutical formulations for the delivery of nifurtimox and benznidazole are discussed.

AB  - Chagas' disease is a global public health problem due to the recent exchange of population between Latin America and other regions, including Europe. The recent development of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for Trypanosoma cruzi infection may improve patient access to diagnosis and care worldwide. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Chagas Stat-Pak RDT in a cohort of undocumented Latin-American migrants living in Geneva, Switzerland. Study participants were enrolled in a primary health care center. The Chagas Stat-Pak test was performed independently on blood and serum samples. A combination of two commercialized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based serological tests was used for comparison (reference standard). A total of 999 adults (median age, 36 years) were included in the study; the majority were women (83%) and originally from Bolivia (47%) or Brazil (25%). A total of 125 participants (12.5%) were diagnosed with T. cruzi infection; with the exception of three individuals, all individuals diagnosed with T. cruzi were originally from Bolivia. The sensitivity and specificity of the Chagas Stat-Pak test on blood samples were 95.2% (95% confidence interval [ 95% CI], 89.2% to 97.9%) and 99.9% (95% CI, 99.3% to 100%), respectively. When the test was performed on serum samples, the sensitivity was 96% (95% CI, 91% to 98.3%), and the specificity was 99.8% (95% CI, 99.2% to 99.9%). The concordance of test results for blood and serum samples was 99.7%. Both negative and positive predictive values were above 98%. The Chagas Stat-Pak is an accurate diagnostic test for T. cruzi infection among Latin-American migrants living in Europe. The mild deficit in sensitivity should be interpreted in light of its ease of use and capacity to provide immediate results, which allow more people at risk to have access to diagnosis and care both in countries where Chagas' disease is endemic and in countries where this disease is not endemic.

AB  - Oral infection has become the most important transmission mechanism of Chagas disease in Brazil. For this study, the development of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in mice, induced by the oral and intraperitoneal (IP) routes, was compared. Four groups of Swiss mice were used to evaluate the influence of parasite genetics, number of parasites, inoculation volume and developmental stages on the development of the orally induced infection: 1 - blood trypomastigotes (BT) via oral; 2- BT via IP; 3 - culture metacyclic trypomastigotes (MT) via oral; and 4- culture MT via IP. Animals inoculated orally showed levels of parasitemia, as well as infectivity and mortality rates, lower than animals inoculated via IP, regardless of DTU (discrete typing unit) and inoculum. Animals infected with TcII showed higher levels of these parameters than did animals infected with TcI. The larger volume of inoculum showed a greater capacity to cause an infection when administered via the oral route. BT infection was more virulent than culture MT infection for both routes (oral and IP). However, mice inoculated orally with BT showed lower levels than via IP, while mice inoculated orally with culture MT showed similar levels of infection to those inoculated via IP. Mice inoculated with culture MT showed more histopathological changes than those inoculated with BT, regardless of the inoculation route. These results indicate that this alternative experimental model is useful for evaluating infection by T. cruzi isolates with subpatent parasitemia and low virulence, such as those belonging to the TcI and TcIV DTUs, which are prevalent in outbreaks of orally transmitted Chagas disease.

AB  - Introduction: This work was an epidemiological investigation of the risk of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission in the rural Quilombola community of Furnas do Dionizio, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Methods: Of the 71 animals examined, seven were captured (two opossums, Didelphis albiventris; four rats, Rattus rattus; and one nine-banded armadillo, Dasypus novemcinctus) and 64 were domestic (one canine, Canis familiaris; five pigs, Sus scrofa; two bovines, Bos taurus; five caprines, Capra sp.; and 51 ovines, Ovis aries). Parasitological tests were performed to detect parasites in the blood and to identify the morphology of flagellates. These methods included fresh examinations, buffy coat tests and blood cultures. Molecular analysis of DNA for identification of trypanosomatids was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers S35 and S36. Results: The parasitological tests showed flagellates in an opossum and two cattle. The molecular tests showed DNA from T. cruzi in an opossum and a pig. Triatoma sordida was the only triatomine species found in the community, and it colonized households (four specimens) and the surrounding areas (124 specimens). Twenty-three specimens tested positive for flagellates, which were subsequently identified as T. cruzi by PCR. Conclusions: Data analysis demonstrated that T. cruzi has a peridomestic life cycle that involves both domestic and wild mammals.

AB  - An entomological survey was carried out in four rural localities situated in the state of Ceara, assessing Chagas disease seroprevalence in man, focusing on the presence of vectors in natural foci contiguous to the domestic and peridomestic environments. Fifty-three Triatoma brasiliensis, nine T. pseudomaculata and 71 Rhodnius nasutus were collected in their natural habitats as far as 10 m from the houses, and 663, 59 and 8 respectively were captured in peridomestic artificial structures, adjacent to the houses, including henhouses, pigpens, corrals, perches and piles of bricks, tiles and wood. Within the households, 37T. brasiliensis, one specimen of T. pseudomaculata and one of R. nasutus were captured. Overall, Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates were 2.3% for T. brasiliensis and 11.3% for R. nasutus. Despite that the seroprevalence survey in man did not reveal positive results using two serological techniques, natural triatomine habitats are juxtaposed to man-made artificial ecotopes, resulting in overlapping habitats. The contiguity between natural ecotopes and human dwellings increases the interaction between vectors and humans, challenging continuous surveillance and vector control efforts.

AB  - The canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) and american trypanosomiasis are important zoonoses in public health and dogs are the main domestic reservoir of the parasite for humans. The goal of this study was to estimate the prevalence of circulating antibodies anti- Trypanosoma cruzi and anti-Leishmania sp. in sera of dogs from the rural area of Botucatu, SP, Brazil. During the annual vaccination campaign against canine rabies in rural area, 689 blood samples were taken and processed by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test. The serological tests revealed the absence of antibodies anti-Leishmania spp., but anti- T cruzi antibodies were detected in 3 (0.4%) dogs.

AB  - The congenital transmission of Chagas disease is associated with an increase in parasitemia during pregnancy, maternal and fetal immunity, and populations of Trypanosoma cruzi. In this study, the biological behavior of TcI and TcV (isolated from a human congenital case) strains and their potential for experimental congenital transmission were evaluated in female BALB/C mice. Parasitemia was estimated by fresh blood examination, semiquantitative microhematocrit, and hemoculture, while congenital transmission was evaluated by culture in the liver infusion tryptose medium and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the pups' tissues on postnatal day 7 and of the pups' blood sample at 30 days after birth. Infection was detected in 100 % of the females. Both strains showed subpatent parasitemia, which was higher for TcV infection. The presence of amastigote nest was detected only in an animal infected with TcI. The inflammatory process was more frequent (p = 0.001) in the tissues of the animals infected with TcV (58.6 %) than TcI (31.1 %). The fertility rates of females mated after 35 days postinfection were similar (90 % for TcV, 88.9 % for TcI; p = 0.938). Parasitemia did not change during pregnancy. The average number of pups/female was greater (p = 0.03) in mice with TcV infection (8.30) than in those with TcI infection (4.78). Congenital transmission was detected exclusively by PCR in 50.9 % of the pups, 46.6 % for TcV and 58.1 % for TcI. The PCR positivity for TcI was higher in the blood than in the tissue (p = 0.003). These results demonstrate the T. cruzi experimental congenital infection associated with subpatent maternal parasitemia of TcI and TcV.

AB  - Introduction: A retrospective study was conducted to assess the occurrence of blood donations that were ineligible due to Chagas disease infection from 1995 to 2009 at the Uberaba Regional Blood Center (HRU), Brazil, verify the tendency of this ineligibility, and describe the epidemiologic profile of the donors. Methods: Retrospective studies of serological ineligibility due to Chagas disease, statistical analysis by means of the chi-square test and odds ratio, study of the tendencies using a dispersion graph and the linear correlation coefficient (r) were performed. Results: In the period under study, a 0.2% serum prevalence of ineligibility due to Chagas disease was found, with a significant drop in ineligible donations from 2001 to 2009. Among the serum positive-donors, there was a significant predominance among those aged 30 years or above and non-single individuals. Conclusions: The results show a rate of occurrence that is lower than that described in literature, as well as a progressive drop during the 15 years under assessment. Such results are a consequence of systematic combat of the vector since the 70s and the progressive and consistent increase of returning donors, resulting in a drop of the contamination risk factor by means of blood transfusion and in the improvement of the quality of hemotherapy practices in the HRU.

AB  - Introduction: The congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cnizi) is responsible for one-third of new Chagas disease cases each year. During congenital transmission, the parasite breaks down the placental barrier formed by the trophoblast, basal laminae and villous stroma. The observation that only 5% of infected mothers transmit the parasite to the fetus implies that the placenta may impair parasite transmission. The trophoblast undergoes continuous epithelial turnover, which is considered part of innate immunity. Therefore, we propose that T. cruzi induces differentiation in the trophoblast as part of a local antiparasitic mechanism of the placenta.
   Methods: We analyzed beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) and syncytin protein expression in HPCVE and BeWo cells using immunofluorescence and western blotting. Additionally, beta-hCG secretion into the culture medium was measured by ELISA. We assessed the differentiation of trophoblastic cells in BeWo cells using the two-color fusion assay and by determining desmoplakin re-distribution.
   Results: T. cnizi trypomastigotes induce beta-hCG secretion and protein expression as well as syncyntin protein expression in HPCVE and BeWo cells. Addionally, the parasite induces the trophoblast fusion of BeWo cells.
   Discussion: T cruzi induces differentiation of the trophoblast, which may contribute to increase the trophoblast turnover. The turnover could be a component of local antiparasitic mechanisms in the human placenta. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A case-control study on the morbidity of Chagas heart disease was carried out in the municipality of Barcelos in the microregion of the Rio Negro, state of Amazonas. One hundred and six individuals, who were serologically positive for Trypanosoma cruzi infection, as confirmed by at least two techniques with different principles, were matched according to age and sex with an equal number of seronegative individuals. The cases and controls were evaluated using an epidemiological questionnaire and clinical, electrocardiograph and echocardiograph examinations. In the seroepidemiological evaluation, 62% of the interviewees recognised triatomines and most of them confirmed that they had seen these insects in the piassava plantations of the riverside communities of the Negro River tributaries. Of the seropositive patients, 25.8% affirmed that they had been stung by the triatomines and 11.7% denied having been stung. The principal clinical manifestations of the seropositive individuals were palpitations, chest pain and dyspnoea upon effort. Cardiac auscultation revealed extrasystoles, bradycardia and systolic murmurs. The electrocardiographic alterations were ventricular extrasystoles, left and right bundle branch block, atrioventricular block and primary T wave alterations. The echocardiogram was altered in 22.6% of the seropositive individuals and in 8.5% of the seronegative individuals.

AB  - Little is known about the immune responses of newborns with congenital Chagas disease (CCD) or congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) but they probably differ to those seen in adults with Chagas disease or toxoplasmosis, leading to differences in pathology. The concentrations of interleukin-18 (IL-18), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) in the sera of infants with CCD or CT were determined and compared with those in the sera of uninfected controls (born to mothers who were seropositive or seronegative for Trypanosoma cruzi). The infants with CCD or CT were found to have lower IL-18 and IFN-gamma concentrations but higher IL-10 concentrations than the uninfected controls. The IL-18 and IFN-gamma concentrations were also significantly lower in the infants with CCD than in those with CT. Although the infants with symptomatic CT had significantly higher serum concentrations of IL-18 than those with asymptomatic infection with Toxoplasma, the infants with symptomatic CCD had similar serum concentrations of IL-18 to the infants with asymptomatic Tr. cruzi infection. Taken together, these results indicate that IL-10 contributes to the suppression of pro-inflammatory immune responses and therefore, perhaps, to clinically overt CCD and CT.

AB  - A study was conducted of the biological, morphological and molecular characters of 3 strains of Trypanosoma cruzi (SI5, SI8 and SIGR(3)) isolated from specimens of Triatoma sordida collected in Santo Inacio and a domestic cat. In order to carry out the study, the following parameters were evaluated: pre-patent period, parasitaemia curves, morphology of the parasites, mortality rates, histopathological lesions and molecular typing. The strains presented variable pre-patent periods, low parasitaemia and no animal mortality. The morphological study of trypomastigotes showed a predominance of intermediate-width and short-length forms, as well as low nuclear index. Epimastigotes presented a low nuclear index, intermediate-width forms in strains SI5 and SI8, and large-width forms in SIGR(3). A shorter length could be noted in strains SI8 and SIGR(3), whereas SI5 displayed an intermediate length. The histopathological study did not detect amastigote nests in tissues. The amplification of the divergent domain of 24S alpha rRNA, HSP60 and GPI genes of strains SI5, SI8 and SIGR(3) classified the 3 strains into Group II. Biological parameters made it possible to classify the strains isolated in Santo Inacio) (BA) into Biodeme III, Zymodeme I and Group II of T. cruzi.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, typically transmitted via infected triatomine bug fecal contamination of bite sites. Other routes of infection include congenital, oral, organ transplantation, and blood product transmission. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From 2007 until 2011, New York Blood Center screened donations for the presence of T.cruzi antibodies using a Food and Drug Administrationapproved test. Confirmatory testing was performed and recipients of units donated by confirmed-positive donors were investigated via lookback. RESULTS: A total of 204 donors were T.cruzi antibody positive representing 0.019% of all donors during this time period (1,066,516 unique donors screened). Of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayreactive donors, 77 were confirmed positive by radioimmunoprecipitation assay (0.007%). At least 154 units from 29 of the confirmed-positive donors had been transfused to 141 recipients. At the time of lookback, 48 of the 141 recipients were alive and seven underwent T.cruzi screening. Two recipients were found to be immunofluorescence assay (IFA) positive. Both IFA-positive recipients received a leukoreduced apheresis platelet unit (two separate donations) from the same confirmed positive donor, a 72-year-old immigrant from Argentina. CONCLUSIONS: Lookback analysis was able to identify the first two cases of probable transfusion-transmitted T.cruzi infection since implementation of the national screening program, which increases the total number of reported cases in the United States to 8.

AB  - In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the prognostic value of beta-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) for all-cause mortality among persons with Chagas disease, a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. The authors used data on 1,398 participants (37.5% infected with T. cruzi) aged 60 years and over from the Bambui Cohort Study of Aging in Brazil. From 1997 to 2007, 512 participants died, leading to 12,406 person-years of observation. The hazard ratio for death was 1.27 for each unit of log-transformed BNP level (95% confidence interval (CI: 1.11, 1.45) among infected persons, independent of potentially confounding factors. Infected persons with baseline BNP levels in the top quartile had a risk of death twice that of persons in the bottom quartile (hazard ratio = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.29, 3.32). The discriminatory ability of BNP in predicting mortality (C = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.66, 0.71) was similar to that of an electrocardiogram (C = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.71), with reasonably stable risk discrimination over time. BNP is a strong predictor of mortality in older adults with Chagas disease. Although the usefulness of BNP for risk stratification in this parasitic disease remains a topic of debate, this study found that BNP-based risk discrimination is at least comparable to that of an electrocardiogram.

AB  - Introduction: The goal was to develop an in-house serological method with high specificity and sensitivity for diagnosis and monitoring of Chagas disease morbidity. Methods: With this purpose, the reactivities of anti-T. cruzi IgG and subclasses were tested in successive serum dilutions of patients from Berilo municipality, Jequitinhonha Valley, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The performance of the in-house ELISA was also evaluated in samples from other relevant infectious diseases, including HIV, hepatitis C (HCV), syphilis (SYP), visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL), and noninfected controls (NI). Further analysis was performed to evaluate the applicability of this in-house methodology for monitoring Chagas disease morbidity into three groups of patients: indeterminate (IND), cardiac (CARD), and digestive/mixed (DIG/Mix), based on their clinical status. Results: The analysis of total IgG reactivity at serum dilution 1: 40 was an excellent approach to Chagas disease diagnosis (100% sensitivity and specificity). The analysis of IgG subclasses showed cross-reactivity, mainly with NI, VL, and ATL, at all selected serum dilutions. Based on the data analysis, the IND group displayed higher IgG3 levels and the DIG/Mix group presented higher levels of total IgG as compared with the IND and CARD groups. Conclusions: These findings demonstrated that methodology presents promising applicability in the analysis of anti-T. cruzi IgG reactivity for the differential diagnosis and evaluation of Chagas disease morbidity.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
LA  - English
AB  - Introduction: In countries with endemic Chagas disease, coinfection involving Trypanosoma cruzi and HIV is expected to become more frequent. There is a clear need to structure a comprehensive care network aimed at dealing with this situation, with mobilization going from primary care to care at the highest level of technological complexity. The objective of this study was to describe the Brazilian response to the challenges of Chagas disease: the history, current issues, and future of the Brazilian Network for attending and studying T. cruzi/HIV coinfection.
   Methodology: This descriptive study reviewed technical documents relating to the basis and structuring process of the Brazilian network for attending and studying T. cruzi/HIV coinfection.
   Results: The process of setting up the network was marked by technical and political debates in technical-scientific meetings going back to the 1990s. This process made it possible to expand and focus on different aspects of comprehensive care for Chagas disease in Brazil, regardless of the associated immunosuppressive conditions. These meetings produced a structure of national technical guidelines and standards, health care and research protocols and research priorities, along with mobilization and awareness-raising among HIV/AIDS reference centers regarding occurrences of coinfection.
   Conclusions: The creation of the Brazilian network was a milestone for the country in terms of integration of control programs, with the reference point of quality of care and comprehensiveness. The possibility of extending this network to form a Latin American network is seen as a strategy for dealing more effectively with this condition.

AB  - We assessed some ecological parameters of Triatoma brasiliensis in rock piles in the state of Ceara during the rainy and dry seasons. The greatest density was in April (median = 12.5 triatomines/site). The greatest abundance was in December, when the insects were more dispersed and the density per site was lower (6 triatomines/site). The nutritional status of females and 5th instar nymphs was increased in July. The rate of T. cruzi infection reached its highest peak in July (10.9%). ELISA revealed that the principal food sources were birds (33.1%), followed by armadillos (18.8%). Food sources were more frequently identified during the rainy season. T. brasiliensis specimens collected in the drought tended to: i) present lower rates of T. cruzi infection and gut content reactivity to tested antisera, ii) have a poorer nutritional status, iii) exhibit lower fecundity, iv) be more dispersed among the studied collection sites, and v) be more abundant and easily collected in the surface of the rocks, possibly reflecting an increased searching for blood meals. Such findings underscore epidemiological concerns and allow inferences about the season when triatomines can more frequently invade the peridomestic environment in search of food and recolonize artificial structures.

AB  - We examined by parasitological tests (hemocultures and buffy coat) infection by Trypanosoma cruzi and T. evansi in blood samples from Leopardus pardalis. Cerdocyon thous and domestic dogs. Besides, 25 T. cruzi isolates previously derived from feral pigs and small wild mammals were here characterized by miniexon gene and demonstrated to be in the TeI genotype. Herein, we make an overall analysis of the transmission cycle of both trypanosome species in the light of the assemblage of data collected over the last seven years. The carnivore Nasua nasua was confirmed to play a major role in the transmission cycles of both T. cruzi and T. evansi since it was the species that had the higher prevalence and higher parasitemias by both flagellate species. In addition, our results show that both trypanosomatid species may be found throughout the Pantanal landscape, in all forest strata, as shown by the infection of carnivore, arboreal and terrestrial scansorial marsupial species in complex and seasonal transmission cycles. We propose that transmission of T. cruzi and T. evansi in the southern Pantanal region takes place via an intricate ecological trophic network involving generalist and specialist mammal species that are linked through a robust food-web connection.

AB  - Background: Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, has high affinity for lipoproteins and adipose tissue. Infection results in myocarditis, fat loss and alterations in lipid homeostasis. This study was aimed at analyzing the effect of high fat diet (HFD) on regulating acute T. cruzi infection-induced myocarditis and to evaluate the effect of HFD on lipid metabolism in adipose tissue and heart during acute T. cruzi infection.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: CD1 mice were infected with T. cruzi (Brazil strain) and fed either a regular control diet (RD) or HFD for 35 days following infection. Serum lipid profile, tissue cholesterol levels, blood parasitemia, and tissue parasite load were analyzed to evaluate the effect of diet on infection. MicroPET and MRI analysis were performed to examine the morphological and functional status of the heart during acute infection. qPCR and immunoblot analysis were carried out to analyze the effect of diet on the genes involved in the host lipid metabolism during infection. Oil red O staining of the adipose tissue demonstrated reduced lipolysis in HFD compared to RD fed mice. HFD reduced mortality, parasitemia and cardiac parasite load, but increased parasite load in adipocytes. HFD decreased lipolysis during acute infection. Both qPCR and protein analysis demonstrated alterations in lipid metabolic pathways in adipose tissue and heart in RD fed mice, which were further modulated by HFD. Both microPET and MRI analyses demonstrated changes in infected RD murine hearts which were ameliorated by HFD.
   Conclusion/Significance: These studies indicate that Chagasic cardiomyopathy is associated with a cardiac lipidpathy and that both cardiac lipotoxicity and adipose tissue play a role in the pathogenesis of Chagas disease. HFD protected mice from T. cruzi infection-induced myocardial damage most likely due to the effects of HFD on both adipogenesis and T. cruzi infection-induced cardiac lipidopathy.

AB  - Two Trypanosoma cruzi Z3 strains, designated as 3663 and 4167, were previously isolated from insect vectors captured in the Brazilian Amazon region. These strains exhibited different infection patterns in Vero, C6/36, RAW 264.7 and HEp-2 cell lineages, in which 3663 trypomastigote form was much less infective than 4167 ones. A proteomic approach was applied to investigate the differences in the global patterns of protein expression in these two Z3 strains. Two-dimensional (2D) protein maps were generated and certain spots were identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Our analyses revealed a significant difference in the expression profile of different proteins between strains 3663 and 4167. Among them, cruzipain, an important regulator of infectivity. This data was corroborated by flow cytometry analysis using anti-cruzipain antibody. This difference could contribute to the infectivity profiles observed for each strain by in vitro assay using different cell lines. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chagas' disease, induced by Trypanosoma cruzi, is a common cause of infectious myocarditis. Recent clinical treatment trials and vaccine studies indicate that chagasic immunopathology is directed against the parasite and not self-antigens. Therefore, vaccines may have the potential to protect against disease progression. Certain combinations of mouse and parasite strains produce significant histopathology and can be used for safety analyses of new vaccination strategies. The goals of this study were to determine (1) whether the development of chagasic cardiomyopathy in the murine model could be identified by electrocardiogram (ECG); and (2) whether these potential chagasic ECG changes would correlate with histopathologic findings. Groups of BALB/c, C57BL/6, and C3H mice were infected with different parasite strains (Tulahuen, Brazil, or Sylvio-X10/4) and evaluated weekly by ECG. Selected tissues from subsets of mice were harvested periodically for blinded histologic evaluation. Significantly increased proportions of BALB/c mice infected with Brazil and Tulahuen strain parasites displayed prolonged QT intervals. Prolonged mean QT intervals detected in infected BALB/c mice significantly correlated with chagasic histopathologic changes. These results indicate that ECG can be used as a non-invasive method to screen for immune-mediated damage resulting in chagasic cardiomyopathy in the murine model.

AB  - The role played by different mammal species in the maintenance of Trypanosoma cruzi is not constant and varies in time and place. This study aimed to characterise the importance of domestic, wild and peridomestic hosts in the transmission of T. cruzi in Taua, state of Ceara, Caatinga area, Brazil, with an emphasis on those environments colonised by Triatoma brasiliensis. Direct parasitological examinations were performed on insects and mammals, serologic tests were performed on household and outdoor mammals and multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used on wild mammals. Cytochrome b was used as a food source for wild insects. The serum prevalence in dogs was 38% (20/53), while in pigs it was 6% (2/34). The percentages of the most abundantly infected wild animals were as follows: Thrichomys laurentius 74% (83/112) and Kerodon rupestris 10% (11/112). Of the 749 triatomines collected in the household research, 49.3% (369/749) were positive for T. brasiliensis, while 6.8% were infected with T. cruzi (25/369). In captured animals, T. brasiliensis shares a natural environment with T. laurentius, K. rupestris, Didelphis albiventris, Monodelphis domestica, Galea spixii, Wiedomys pyrrhorhinos, Conepatus semistriatus and Mus musculus. In animals identified via their food source, T. brasiliensis shares a natural environment with G. spixii, K. rupestris, Capra hircus, Gallus gallus, Tropidurus oreadicus and Tupinambis merianae. The high prevalence of T. cruzi in household and peridomiciliar animals reinforces the narrow relationship between the enzootic cycle and humans in environments with T. brasiliensis and characterises it as ubiquitous.

AB  - Studies were made on the ribosomal DNA intergenic region, comprising complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-1, 5.8S, and ITS-2 sequences, of populations of the triatomine Panstrongylus megistus, the most important vector of Chagas' disease in Brazil since Triatoma infestans eradication. Specimens were from 26 localities of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Parana, Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Bahia, and Sergipe states. In total, 21 ITS-1 and 12 ITS-2 haplotypes were found. Nucleotide differences were higher in ITS-1 (3.00%) than in ITS-2 (1.33%). The intergenic region was 1,513-1,522-bp-long (mean 1,516.9 bp), providing 26 combined haplotypes. The combination of microsatellites found in both ITSs may be of applied usefulness, to assess interpopulation specimen exchange and potential recolonizations after vector elimination by control implementation. Network results suggest that Sao Paulo may be considered one of the spreading centers of this species. Molecular clock datation suggests that P. megistus populations are diversifying at least since 4.54 million years ago, with diversification still ongoing today by geographical isolation of populations. Evidence is provided about the relationship of genetic diversity with geographical spread that characterizes a major vector and explains its ability to colonize distant areas and different ecotopes, including human habitats, and consequently its importance in Chagas' disease epidemiology.

AB  - The present study analyzed serum samples from 111 male and female dogs of various ages from the municipality of Araguaina in the State of Tocantins, Brazil. Serological diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) was initially performed at the Central Laboratory (Laboratorio Central - LACEN) of Araguaina, resulting in 61 positive samples by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIFA) (>= 1:40) and 50 non-reactive samples. The same samples were analyzed at the Sao Paulo Institute of Tropical Medicine (Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo - IMTSP) by an enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA), resulting in 57 positive samples (51.35%) and 54 negative samples (48.64%). The Kappa coefficient of agreement between the tests was 0.74. The serum samples were also subjected to a diagnostic assay for Trypanosoma cruzi (Trypomastigote Excreted/Secreted Antigens -TESA-blot) that detected five suspect animals; three of those animals were positive for leishmaniasis by ELISA but negative by IIFA. These findings suggest that the canine population of Araguaina may be simultaneously infected with Leishmania chagasi and T. cruzi. The results obtained demonstrate the difficulty of using serology to detect CVL, thus emphasizing the necessity for a reference test to diagnose CVL, particularly in regions where the infection is endemic.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are an essential component of the insect immune system. One of the most ubiquitous is defensin, which has been identified in all examined insect orders. Triatoma brasiliensis (Heteroptera, Triatominae), the main Trypanosoma cruzi vector in semi-arid regions of north-eastern Brazil, expresses def1, a defensin encoding gene, predominantly in the anterior region (cardia and stomach) of the midgut. In the present study, we compared the transcript abundance of T. brasiliensis def1 in the anterior (stomach) and posterior midgut (small intestine) regions of naive bugs with those infected with a familiar T. cruzi isolate. In the stomach, only slight differences between the two insect groups were visible, whereas in the small intestine wide differences (up to 9.6-fold) between infected and noninfected bugs become apparent. The highly increased def1 transcript abundance at 20 days after the infective blood meal might be a response to the T. cruzi infection, suggesting a potential function of intestinal defensin in the parasite population control.

AB  - Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and remains a health problem in the developing countries of South America. The condition leads to cardiac conduction disturbances and chronic heart failure. In this study, 136 individuals were evaluated by the Chagas Disease Study Group of the Hospital de la Universidad Estatal de Campinas in Brazil to determine the relationship between chronic heart failure and the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level. When patients were stratified according to the different clinical presentations of Chagas disease, it was found that the CRP levels in those with severe heart disease and non-Chagasic cardiopathy were significantly higher than in controls or those with mild heart disease (P<.05), even when participants were stratified by age (i.e. <40 and <40 years). There was a direct linear correlation between age and CRP level, such that the older the individual, the higher the CRP level. These data provide further evidence for an association between chronic inflammation and the development of heart failure. Although CRP elevations are not exclusively related to Chagas disease, the CRP level may be a useful marker for the progression of Chagas disease to a more advanced phase.

In the present study, we employed magnetic resonance imaging to non-invasively monitor the effect of selenium supplementation on alterations in the GI tract of T. cruzi-infected mice. CD1 mice infected with T. cruzi (Brazil strain) exhibited dilatation of the intestines similar to that we recently reported in infected C57Bl/6 mice. The average intestine lumen diameter increased by 65% and the increase was reduced to 29% in mice supplemented with 2 ppm selenium in the drinking water. When supplemented with 3 ppm selenium in chow the lumen diameter was also significantly reduced although the difference between the infected and infected supplemented mice was smaller. Intestinal motility in infected mice fed with selenium-enriched chow was increased compared with infected mice fed with normal unsupplemented chow and was not significantly different from intestinal motility in uninfected mice. We suggest that Se may be used to modulate the inflammatory, immunological, and/or antioxidant responses involved in intestinal disturbances caused by T. cruzi infection.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, the cause of American trypanosomiasis, or Chagas disease, is a protozoan parasite that is enzootic and endemic in much of the Americas, where it infects a wide variety of wild and domestic mammals as well as many species of triatomine vectors, in addition to humans. Historically, vector-borne transmission of T. cruzi has been the most important mechanism through which humans have become infected with the parasite, but transmission by blood transfusion and congenital transmission also have been important. In many of the endemic countries transmission of T. cruzi has improved markedly in recent years as vector control and donor screening programs have been implemented on a widespread basis.
   In the United States autochthonous transmission of T. cruzi appears to be extremely rare. Five persons are known to have become infected with T. cruzi through organ transplants here, and prior to the implementation of blood donor screening in 2007 five instances of transmission by transfusion had been reported. Current estimates put the total number of T. cruzi-infected persons living in the United States at 300,000, essentially all of whom are immigrants from the endemic countries. The obstacles that stand in the way of the total elimination of T. cruzi transmission throughout the endemic range are economic and political, and no major technological advances are needed to accomplish this goal.

AB  - Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) and adipocytes are targets of Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Adipose tissue obtained from CD-1 mice 15 days after infection, an early stage of infection revealed a high parasite load. There was a significant increase in macrophages in infected adipose tissue and a reduction in lipid accumulation, adipocyte size, and fat mass and increased expression of lipolytic enzymes. Infection increased levels of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and TLR9 and in the expression of components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma were increased in WAT, whereas protein and mRNA levels of adiponectin were significantly reduced in BAT and WAT. The mRNA levels of cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors were increased. Nuclear Factor Kappa B levels were increased in BAT, whereas I kappa kappa-gamma levels increased in WAT. Adipose tissue is an early target of T. cruzi infection.

AB  - Objective To assess the susceptibility of Trypanosoma cruzi strains from Amazon to benznidazole. Methods We studied 23 strains of T. cruzi obtained from humans in the acute phase of Chagas disease, triatomines and marsupials in the state of Amazonas and from chronic patients and triatomines in the state of Parana, Brazil. The strains were classified as TcI (6), TcII (4) and TcIV (13). For each strain, 20 Swiss mice were inoculated: 10 were treated orally with benznidazole 100 mg/kg/day (TBZ group) for 20 consecutive days and 10 comprised the untreated control group (NT). Fresh blood examination, haemoculture (HC), PCR, and ELISA were used to monitor the cure. Results The overall cure rate was 60.5% (109/180 mice) and varied widely among strains. The strains were classified as resistant, partially resistant or susceptible to benznidazole, irrespective of discrete typing units (DTUs), geographical origin or host. However, the TcI strains from Amazonas were significantly (P = 0.028) more sensitive to benznidazole than the TcI strains from Parana. The number of parasitological, molecular and serological parameters that were significantly reduced by benznidazole treatment also varied among the DTUs; the TBZ group of mice inoculated with TcIV strains showed more reductions (8/9) than those with TcI and TcII strains. Conclusions Benznidazole resistance was observed among natural populations of the parasite in the Amazon, even in those never exposed to the drug.

AB  - The intergenic region of spliced-leader (SL-IR) genes from 105 Trypanosoma cruzi I (Tc I) infected biological samples, culture isolates and stocks from 11 endemic countries, from Argentina to the USA were characterised, allowing identification of 76 genotypes with 54 polymorphic sites from 123 aligned sequences. On the basis of the microsatellite motif proposed by Herrera et al. (2007) to define four haplotypes in Colombia, we could classify these genotypes into four distinct Tc I SL-IR groups, three corresponding to the former haplotypes la (11 genotypes), Ib (11 genotypes) and Id (35 genotypes): and one novel group, le (19 genotypes). Genotypes harbouring the Tc Ic motif were riot detected in our study. Tc la was associated with domestic cycles in southern and northern South America and sylvatic cycles in Central and North America. Tc Ib was found in all transmission cycles from Colombia. Tc Id was identified in all transmission cycles from Argentina and Colombia, including Chagas cardiomyopathy patients, sylvatic Brazilian samples and human cases from French Guiana, Panama and Venezuela. Tc le gathered five samples from domestic Triatoma infestans from northern Argentina, nine samples from wild Mepraia spinolai and Mepraia gajardoi and two chagasic patients from Chile and one from a Bolivian patient with chagasic reactivation. Mixed infections by Tc la + Tc Id, Tc la + Tc le and Tc Id + T: le were detected in vector faeces and isolates from human and vector samples. In addition, Tc la and Tc Id were identified in different tissues from a heart transplanted Chagas cardiomyopathy patient with reactivation, denoting histotropism. Trypanosoma cruzi I SL-IR genotypes from parasites infecting Triatoma gerstaeckeri and Didelphis virginiana from USA. T. infestans from Paraguay, Rhodnius nasutus and Rhodnius neglectus from Brazil and M. spinolai and M. gajardoi from Chile are to our knowledge described for the first time.

AB  - Background. Chagas disease is a parasitic disease due to Typanosoma cruzi, endemic in Central and Southern America, where the protozoon infects about 8-10 million people. In rural areas the infection is acquired mostly through reduviidae insect vectors, whereas in urban ones it is acquired mainly through the transfusion of blood products, vertical transmission and organ transplantation. The important migratory flows of the last decades have focused attention on possible T cruzi transmission by transfusion also in non-endemic countries, and platelets have been recognised as the main origin of infection for recipients from serologically-positive Latino-American donors.
   Materials and methods. In order to avoid the occurrence of transfusion-related cases, in 2010 systematic screening for anti-T cruzi antibodies was started at the Umberto I Polyclinic in Rome, controlling blood donors born and/or coming from Latin-American countries in which the disease is endemic. The aim of this paper is to report the preliminary results achieved since the introduction of this screening.
   Results. Anti-T cruzi antibodies have been detected to date in 3.9% out of the 128 people examined. A seropositive subject also proved positive by polymerase chain reaction analysis and showed very light parasitaemia.
   Discussion. The preliminary results are quite alarming. Indeed, serological findings exceed those reported in other non-endemic countries, and Italian travellers proved to be an insidious possible source of direct transmission. The need for systematic screening of at-risk blood donors also in non-endemic countries is emphasised.

AB  - To determine the infestation and trypanosome infection of triatomines captured in Mauritia flexuosa palm trees across its geographic distribution in the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado), we sampled 42 localities in eight states and in the Federal District, Brazil, between July 2005 and January 2010. Overall, 2154 specimens of the species Rhodnius neglectus, Psammolestes tertius, Triatoma sordida, and Microtriatoma borbai, were collected. Among the 341 palms sampled, 182(53.3%) were infested with R. neglectus, which resulted in the capture of 1639 specimens (9.0 insects per infested palm). P. tertius occurred in 26 palms (8%), which resulted in the capture of 484 specimens (19 insects per infested palm). T. sordida (n = 30) and M. borbai (n = 1) occurred in only one location. From 537 R. neglectus examined, 44 were infected (8%) with Trypanosoma rangeli and/or Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc Id). M. flexuosa was previously recognized as a suitable breeding ecotope for R. neglectus in the Brazilian states of Minas Gerais, Goias, Tocantins and the Federal District. Our results expand this distribution to other states (Sao Paulo, Bahia, Mato Grosso, Maranhao and Piaui), and also show that this particular palm tree harbors other triatomine species. Finally, we show that R. neglectus plays an important role in maintaining the enzootic circulation of T. cruzi and T. rangeli in the Brazilian savanna. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The pathogenesis and evolutive pattern of Chagas disease suggests that the chronic phase should be more widely treated in order to (i) eliminate Trypanosoma cruzi and prevent new inflammatory foci and the extension of tissue lesions, (ii) promote tissue regeneration to prevent fibrosis, (iii) reverse existing fibrosis, (iv) prevent cardiomyopathy, megaoesophagus and megacolon and (v) reduce or eliminate cardiac block and arrhythmia. All cases of the indeterminate chronic form of Chagas disease without contraindications due to other concomitant diseases or pregnancy should be treated and not only cases involving children or recently infected cases. Patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy grade II of the New York Heart Association classification should be treated with specific chemotherapy and grade III can be treated according to medical-patient decisions. We are proposing the following new strategies for chemotherapeutic treatment of the chronic phase of Chagas disease: (i) repeated short-term treatments for 30 consecutive days and interval of 30-60 days for six months to one year and (ii) combinations of drugs with different mechanisms of action, such as benznidazole + nifurtimox, benznidazole or nifurtimox + allopurinol or triazole antifungal agents, inhibition of sterol synthesis.

AB  - Although human leishmaniasis has been reported in 20 states in Mexico, no case of leishmaniasis has been reported in cats to date. In the Yucatan Peninsula. it has been found that dogs may act as reservoirs for at least three Leishmania species (Leishmania mexicana, Leishmania braziliensis, and Leishmania panamensis).
   In this study we identified specific antibodies against these three Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi in the sera from 95 cats from two States on the Yucatan Peninsula. namely Quintana Roo and Yucatan, by ELISA and Western blot techniques using whole extract and an iron superoxide dismutase excreted by the parasites as antigens.
   As well as demonstrating the presence of trypanosomatid antibodies in the feline population on the Yucatan Peninsula, we were also able to confirm the high sensitivity and specificity of the iron superoxide dismutase antigen secreted by them, which may prove to be very useful in epidemiological studies.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to review the literature on the relationship between nutrition and neglected infectious disease in Brazilian populations, in particular Chagas' Disease, malaria, schistosomiasis and visceral leishmaniasis. The literature review was performed in January 2010 by searching the databases SciELO, LILACS and Medline. Two-hundred and ninety-three abstracts were retrieved, 66 of them were selected for full-text analysis and 43 were included in the review. This review reinforces the relevance of nutritional studies in public health for better understanding the aspects involved in the risk and prognosis of malaria, schistosomiasis, visceral leishmaniasis and Chagas' Disease. It was possible to detect an unbalance in the literature about the theme, with much more experimental studies than population-based studies. Although the first are essential for helping to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association between nutritional deficits and those diseases, well designed population-based studies are fundamental for the translation of scientific research into effective actions for controlling neglected diseases.

AB  - Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is an accurate method to quantify Trypanosoma cruzi DNA and can be used to follow-up parasitemia in Chagas disease (CD) patients undergoing chemotherapy. The Benznidazole Evaluation for Interrupting Trypanosomiasis (BENEFIT) study is an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of benznidazole (BZ) treatment in patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC). One important question to be addressed concerns the effectiveness of BZ in reducing overall parasite load in CCC patients, even in the absence of parasitological cure. This report describes the evaluation of multiple procedures for DNA extraction and qPCR-based protocols aiming to establish a standardized methodology for the absolute quantification of T. cruzi DNA in Guanidine-EDTA blood (GEB) samples. A panel of five primer sets directed to the T. cruzi nuclear satellite DNA repeats (Sat-DNA) and to the minicircle DNA conserved regions (kDNA) was compared in either SYBR Green or TaqMan systems. Standard curve parameters such as, amplification efficiency, coefficient of determination and intercept were evaluated, as well as different procedures to generate standard samples containing pre-established T. cruzi DNA concentration. Initially, each primer set was assayed in a SYBR Green qPCR to estimate parasite load in GEB samples from chronic Chagas disease patients. The results achieved from Bayesian transmutability analysis elected the primer sets Cruzi1/Cruzi2 (p = 0.0031) and Diaz7/Diaz8 (p = 0.0023) coupled to the QIAamp DNA Kit extraction protocol (silica gel column), as the most suitable for monitoring parasitemia in these patients. Comparison between the parasite burden of 150 GEB samples of BENEFIT patients from Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, prior to drug/placebo administration, was performed using Cruzi1/Cruzi2 primers in a SYBR Green approach. The median parasitemia found in patients from Argentina and Colombia (1.93 and 2.31 parasite equivalents/mL, respectively) was around 20 times higher than the one estimated for the Brazilian patients (0.1 parasite equivalents/mL). This difference could be in part due to the complexity of T. cruzi genetic diversity, which is a factor possibly implicated in different clinical presentations of the disease and/or influencing parasitemia levels in infected individuals from different regions of Latin America. The results of SYBR Green qPCR assays herein presented prove this methodology to be more cost efficient than the alternative use of internal fluorogenic probes. In addition, its sensitivity and reproducibility are shown to be adequate to detect low parasitemia burden in patients with chronic Chagas disease. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two serological surveys were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of measures put into effect in the State of Sao Paulo (Brazil) to control Chagas disease vectors. The first one, during the period from 1968 to 1970; the complement fixation reaction was performed on serum samples from school-children resident in all municipalities of the State of Sao Paulo, with the exception of the Greater Sao Paulo. The second one, annually, from 1973 to 1983, involving school-children resident in municipalities with high trypanosomiasis prevalence values; the indirect immuno-fluorescence test was performed on filter paper total blood eluates. Data on the occurrence of triatomines and their infection with Trypanosoma cruzi in each municipality formed the basis of insight into the epidemiological situation associated with the school-children's dates of birth. Most positive serological results, as well as the highest proportion of autochthonous cases associated with Triatoma infestans were observed in the region of Sorocaba until the early 1970s, while the proportions of both autochthonous and imported cases were kept in equilibrium elsewhere. It has been inferred that as recently as 1974, vectorial transmission of Chagas disease could still be observed in the State of Sao Paulo. We emphasize that, even rather lacking in coverage, no seropositive cases have been observed in people inhabiting the regions included in the Control Program for the State of Sao Paulo and now aged less than 15 years.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc), the causative agent of Chagas disease, is a diverse species with 2 primary genotypes, TcI and TcII, with TcII further subdivided into 5 subtypes (11a-c) This study evaluated infection dynamics of 4 genetically and geographically diverse T crux, strains in 2 South American reservoirs, degus (Octodon degus) and grey short-tailed opossums (Monodelphis domestica) Based on prior suggestions of a genotype-host association, we hypothesized that degus (placental) would more readily become infected with Tell strains while short-tailed opossums (marsupral) would be a more competent reservoir for a Tc1 strain Individuals (n=3) of each species were intraperitoneally inoculated with T cruzi, trypomastigotes of TcIIb [North America (NA)-raccoon (Procyon lotor) origin], TcI [NA-Virginia opossum (Dulelplus virgimana)], TcIIb [South At (SA)-human], TcIIe (SA- Triatoma infestans), or both TcI and TcIIa. Parasitaemias in experimentally infected degus peaked earlier (7-14 clays post-inoculation (p 1)) compared with short-tailed opossums (21-84 days p i) Additionally, peak parasitaemias were higher in degus, however, the duration of detectable parasitaemias for all strains, except TcII la, was greater in short-tailed opossums Infections established in both host species with all genotypes, except for Tc I la, which did not establish a detectable infection in short-tailed opossums These results indicate that both South American reservoirs support infections with these Isolates from North and South America, however, infection dynamics differed with host and parasite strain

AB  - Introduction: The present study identified the triatomines collected in intra and peri-domestic environments, observed the occurrence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in triatomines and correlated this information with housing conditions and the fauna associated with the rural areas of the City of Itabaianinha, located in the State of Sergipe, Brazil. Methods: Quarterly visits were conducted between March 2009 and March 2010, and the homes to be visited for the active search of insects were determined by random selection. In each housing unit, the insects were collected by a manual search with a metal clip and flashlight to inspect openings and cavities, with a collection time of one hour/home/individual. The Pirisa (R) dislodge chemical was used to force the insects to leave their ecotopes. Analysis of the intestinal contents of triatomines was performed in the laboratory to establish the presence of Trypanosomatidae. Results: Of the 103 dwellings surveyed, 17.5% were infested with Panstrongylus megistus. The village of Mutuca exhibited the highest infestation rate (38.1%). All the villages with relevant infestation rates were situated in the northern area of the city. The highest percentage of vector infection was found in the village of Agua Boa (56.5%). The rural dwellings were found to be primarily brick or wooden house with or without roughcast or plastered walls, and the outbuilding most frequently associated with triatomines was the chicken run. Conclusions: These results emphasise the need for broader vector control and surveillance and for educational campaigns in the context of the Chagas Disease Control Program.

AB  - Introduction: Entomological surveillance of Chagas disease in the Federal District of Brazil (DF), has recorded the following triatomine species: Panstrongylus megistus, P. geniculatus, P. diasi, Rhodnius neglectus, Triatoma pseudomaculata, and T. sordida. We aimed to analyze the spatial and temporal occurrence of triatomine species collected in DF, and their indices of natural infection with trypanosomes. Methods: The Health State Secretariat of DF recorded triatomines between 2002 and 2010 in 20 administrative regions. This retrospective analysis considered the number of adults and nymphs of each species collected and infected in both intradomicile and peridomicile. Results: A total of 754 triatomines were collected in 252 reported domiciles. Panstrongylus megistus was the most frequent species (65%), followed by T. pseudomaculata (14%). Of the 309 examined insects, only 3 (1%) specimens of P. megistus were infected with flagellates morphologically similar to Trypanosoma cruzi. The spatial occurrence indicated a higher diversity of triatomines and frequency of T. sordida in rural areas. Moreover, there was a predominance of P. megistus in urban areas. The number of records of P. megistus in the rainy season was two times higher than that during the dry season. The largest number of triatomines was collected in November. Conclusions: The presence of P. megistus specimens infected with trypanosomes in domiciles, shows the potential risk of human infection in DF. Thus, it is essential to continue entomological surveillance, intensifying it in the rainy season and in regions of greater occurrence.

AB  - A significant role for hormones in regulating the balance of Th1- and Th2-associated cytokines with a role in modulating diseases has been accumulating. Previously, we reported that dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), the most abundant steroid hormone synthesized by the adrenal cortex, markedly reduced the blood and tissue parasites in experimentally Trypanosoma cruzi-infected rats. Based on these findings, the main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate ester (DHEA-S) therapy alone or in combination with benznidazole (BNZ) (recommended in Brazil for the treatment of T. cruzi infection) will be effective during the acute phase of two different lineages of T. cruzi strains: type I (Y strain) and type II (Bolivia strain) of T. cruzi. Administration of either DHEA-S or BNZ alone or in combination significantly reduced the Y strain parasite load as compared with untreated. Furthermore treatment with DHEA-S resulted in Bolivia strain clearance. This protective effect of DHEA-S was associated with the host's immune response, as evidence by enhanced levels of interferon-gamma and interleukin-2. DHEA-S treatment also increased peritoneal macrophages levels and nitrite production. DHEA-S treatment was effective in reducing the mortality rate as compared to BNZ alone or to combiner DHEA-S+BNZ treatment of T. cruzi Bolivia strain infected animals. These findings suggest that hormonal therapy may have a protective effect in the treatment of T. cruzi infection. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas disease remains a severe public health problem in Latin America, despite control over its transmission. This study evaluated the prevalence of Chagas disease in the Serra Azul district, in the central-western region of the State of Minas Gerais, through identifying electrocardiographic (EKG) abnormalities among serologically positive individuals. Methods: Specific serological tests for Chagas disease were carried out on 676 individuals (48% of the population). Clinical examinations and EKGs were performed on the serologically positive population. A control group was selected for comparison with the EKG data. Results: The study population lived mainly in rural areas, with low sociocultural level. Forty subjects were positive (prevalence of 2.1%). The individuals with Chagas disease were in an older age group (67 vs. 39 years; p < 0.001). EKG abnormalities were frequent among the individuals with Chagas disease (79%). Among the seropositive individuals, the EKGs showed greater prevalence of ventricular premature beats and conduction disorder of the right branch alone or in association with anterosuperior division blockage, in relation to the controls. Conclusions: The prevalence of Chagas disease in the Serra Azul district was 2.1%. The seropositive individuals were in an older group, thus suggesting that transmission had been brought under control. EKG abnormalities occurred frequently, and conduction disorders of the right branch predominated.

AB  - Among the states that comprise the legally defined Amazon region of Brazil, Para has presented the highest occurrences of acute cases of Chagas disease over the last two decades. These cases have been attributed to consumption of fruits from native palm trees. In surveys in rural and wild areas of the municipality of Oriximina, Para, triatomine fauna, their main ecotopes and the infection rate due to Trypanosoma cruzi were identified using active and passive search methods: manual capture and Noireau traps, respectively. A total of 582 ecotopes were surveyed using 1496 Noireau traps. Out of 442 specimens collected, 289 were identified as Rhodnius robustus and 153 as Rhodnius pictipes. The infection rate caused by T. cruzi was 17.4%. The food sources of the triatomines were found to be birds, hemolymph, horses, and rodents. The association between R. robustus and inaja palm trees (Attalea marita), which are abundant in rural areas, was confirmed. On the other hand, R. pictipes is found in several palm tree species, such as maid (A. marita), mucaja (Acrocomia aculeata), murumuru (Astrocaryum murumuru) and pataua (Oenocarpus bataua), and in bromeliads in wild areas. These occurrences of triatomine species in regions with or without T. cruzi infection, in the vicinity of the main settlement of the municipality, suggest that there is a need for entomological and epidemiological surveillance in this region.

AB  - Along with several other aspects of Chagas disease, the mechanisms responsible for the different clinical outcomes observed in chronic infected individuals have not yet been clarified. It is believed that the host immune response to the parasite plays an important role in the development of the pathology. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between IL-10 and IFN-gamma gene expression profile, after in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with Trypanosoma cruzi recombinant antigens CRA (cytoplasmatic repetitive antigen) and FRA (flagellar repetitive antigen), and the clinical forms of chronic Chagas disease. Twenty patients with the cardiac form of the disease (CARD), of whom 10 had the mild cardiac form (CARD 1) and 10 the severe cardiac form (CARD 2), and 20 patients with the indeterminate form (IND), were selected at the Chagas Disease Unit of the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital, University of Pernambuco, Recife, Pernambuco, Brazil. The PBMCs of these individuals were cultured in the presence of CRA or FRA for 3 days and IL-10 and IFN-gamma gene expression was evaluated by detection of its messenger RNA using Real Time Quantitative PCR. Although no significant difference was observed between the groups of individuals studied, we found that most patients with IND displayed high levels of IFN-gamma gene expression, while the majority of patients with CARD 1 presented high levels of IL-10. The results of this study thus highlight the important role that inflammatory cytokines play in patients with the IND group controlling for parasite replication, and that anti-inflammatory cytokines play in determining susceptibility to progression to symptomatic clinical forms of the disease.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease, resulting from infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), is a major cause of cardiomyopathy in Latin America. Drug therapy for acute and chronic disease is limited. Stem cell therapy with bone marrow mesenchymal cells (MSCs) has emerged as a novel therapeutic option for cell death-related heart diseases, but efficacy of MSC has not been tested in Chagas disease.
   Methods and Results: We now report the use of cell-tracking strategies with nanoparticle labeled MSC to investigate migration of transplanted MSC in a murine model of Chagas disease, and correlate MSC biodistribution with glucose metabolism and morphology of heart in chagasic mice by small animal positron emission tomography (microPET). Mice were infected intraperitoneally with trypomastigotes of the Brazil strain of T. cruzi and treated by tail vein injection with MSC one month after infection. MSCs were labeled with near infrared fluorescent nanoparticles and tracked by an in vivo imaging system (IVIS). Our IVIS results two days after transplant revealed that a small, but significant, number of cells migrated to chagasic hearts when compared with control animals, whereas the vast majority of labeled MSC migrated to liver, lungs and spleen. Additionally, the microPET technique demonstrated that therapy with MSC reduced right ventricular dilation, a phenotype of the chagasic mouse model.
   Conclusions: We conclude that the beneficial effects of MSC therapy in chagasic mice arise from an indirect action of the cells in the heart rather than a direct action due to incorporation of large numbers of transplanted MSC into working myocardium.

AB  - Chagas disease is responsible for a large number of human infections and many are also at risk of infection. There is no effective drug for Chagas disease treatment. The Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology at Fiocruz, Brazil, has designed three nitro analogs of the nitroimidazole-thiadiazole, megazol: two triazole analogs PTAL 05-02 and PAMT 09 and a pyrazole analog PTAL 04-09. A set of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains were used in the bacterial reverse mutation test (Ames test) to determine the mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of megazol and its nitro analogs. Megazol presented positive mutagenic activity at very low concentration, either with or without metabolic activation S9 mix. The mutagenic response of the analogs was detected at higher concentration than the lowest megazol concentration to yield mutagenic activity showing that new advances can be made to develop new analogs. The micronucleus test with rat macrophage cells was used in the genotoxic evaluation. The analogs were capable of inducing micronucleus formation and showed cytotoxic effects. PTAL 04-09 structural modifications might be better suitable for the design of promising new drugs candidate for Chagas' disease treatment.

AB  - A sylvatic infection focus of Topanosoma rangeli, whose cycle involves the anteater Tamandua tetradactyla and triatomine insect Rhodnius robustus was observed in a pasture-dominated landscape of the rural riparian community of Sao Tome located along the Tapajos river in the municipal district of Aveiro (State of Para, Brazil), the Brazilian Amazon region. During a field work campaign with the objective of Chagas disease diagnosis in the Tapajos region, an anteater and 31 triatomines were found inhabiting in the same Attalea phalerata palm tree crown. Collected triatomines were identified as R. robustus with morphological and molecular procedures. The analysis of infection by T. rangeli using the repetitive ARN nucleolar Cl1 (sno-RNA-Cl1) gene showed that 25 triatomines of all stages were infected by T. rangeli (total infection rate of 80.6%). Infection by Trypanosoma cruzi using mini-exon markers was not identified. Examination of the digestive content of the triatomines demonstrated that the only feeding source found was the anteater. These results demonstrate that T. tetradactyla can be an important reservoir for T. rangeli and a good vehicle of the parasite within the Brazilian Amazon region.

AB  - Our objective was to determine the seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection among mothers and children in two rural Mayan communities in Yucatan, Mexico and examine sociodemographic characteristics and adverse reproductive outcomes associated with maternal infection. We performed household surveys in the communities of Sudzal and Teya. Mothers were interviewed, and blood samples were obtained to perform rapid tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). We surveyed 390 mothers and 685 children. The overall seroprevalence was 2.3% among mothers and 0.4% among children. In Sudzal, we found a seroprevalence of 4.4% among mothers and 0.7% in children. In Teya, we found a seroprevalence of 0.9% among mothers and 0.3% among children. Compared with uninfected mothers, seropositive mothers reported more stillbirths (relative risk = 4.7; 95% confidence interval = 2.1-10.4). T. cruzi infection is present in these communities, and infected children indicate active transmission. Seropositivity in mothers is associated with a history of adverse reproductive outcomes.

AB  - Natural infection of wild mammals by protozoa parasites is quite common in nature. For Neotropical Primates different infections of parasites that are etiological agent of disease in human have been identified. In particular, infections by Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania sp., have been reported for some New World primate species, but there are no reports of infection with these parasites in any primate species in Mexico. A serological study was conducted on two howler monkey species (Alouatta pigra and A. palliata) from the Mexican states of Campeche and Tabasco. A total of 55 serum samples (20 samples from A. pigra, 20 samples from A. palliata, and 15 samples from semifree ranging A. palliata of Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz as negative controls) were analyzed for the detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies against T. cruzi and Leishmania mexicana through enzyme linked immunosorbent assay test, indirect immunofluorescence assay and Western blot. The overall prevalence of antibodies in howler monkeys was 17.5% for T. cruzi and 30% for L. mexicana. Our results also indicate that A. pigra is more susceptible to develop leishmaniasis than A. palliata. Finally, the finding of positive serology in these primates should be given serious consideration for public health, given the potential role of these primate species as wild reservoirs for these diseases and the increasing contact of monkeys with human populations due to habitat loss and fragmentation.

AB  - An estimated 100 million people in the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region live on less than US$2 per day, while another 46 million people in the US live below that nation's poverty line. Almost all of the 'bottom 100 million' people suffer from at least one neglected tropical disease (NTD), including one-half of the poorest people in the region infected with hookworms, 10 % with Chagas disease, and up to 1-2 % with dengue, schistosomiasis, and/or leishmaniasis. In the US, NTDs such as Chagas disease, cysticercosis, toxocariasis, and trichomoniasis are also common among poor populations. These NTDs trap the poorest people in the region in poverty, because of their impact on maternal and child health, and occupational productivity. Through mass drug administration (MDA), several NTDs are on the verge of elimination in the Americas, including lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, trachoma, and possibly leprosy. In addition, schistosomiasis may soon be eliminated in the Caribbean. However, for other NTDs including hookworm infection, Chagas disease, dengue, schistosomiasis, and leishmaniasis, a new generation of 'anti-poverty vaccines' will be required. Several vaccines for dengue are under development by multinational pharmaceutical companies, whereas others are being pursued through non-profit product development partnerships (PDPs), in collaboration with developing country manufacturers in Brazil and Mexico. The Sabin Vaccine Institute PDP is developing a primarily preventive bivalent recombinant human hookworm vaccine, which is about to enter phase 1 clinical testing in Brazil, as well as a new therapeutic Chagas disease vaccine in collaboration with several Mexican institutions. The Chagas disease vaccine would be administered to seropositive patients to delay or prevent the onset of Chagasic cardiomyopathy (secondary prevention). Together, MDA and the development of new anti-poverty vaccines afford an opportunity to implement effective control and elimination strategies for the major NTDs in the Americas.

AB  - In order to determine the epidemiological aspects involving canine Chagas disease (CD) and to identify major risk factors for the disease in the semi-arid region of Paraiba, a study was conducted in the rural area of Patos/Paraiba, Brazil, where the area was divided into three sampling strata (North, South and West) and, in each stratum we randomly sampled about 294 houses, and all the pet dogs represented the elementary units of study. In each household an epidemiological questionnaire was administered to obtain information on indicators that favor the spread of the disease in peridomestic segment. Serological diagnosis for CD in dogs was based on three methods (IFA, ELISA and HAI), considering positive samples that had at least two tests reagents and absence of cross-reaction. For the rural area, the prevalence of seropositive dogs for Trypanosoma cruzi by sampling stratum was: North 6.05%, South 3.59% and West 2.97%, corresponding to a total prevalence of 4.08%. The risk factors (odds ratio, OR) were evidenced in multifactorial analysis: wall type (OR=2.59 [1.24-5.4]), presence at warehouse (OR=1.89 [1.31-3.0]), present at chicken stall (OR=8.31 [1.29-61.7]), contact with animals (OR =9.11 [1.12-73.9]), contact with birds (OR=9.7 [1.81-52.83]), captured triatomines (OR=16.58 [3.43-80.23]) and anthropogenic (OR=4.35 [1.36-14.0]. From the results it was possible to obtain information pertaining to the epidemiological situation of Chagas Disease highlighting biogeographical characteristics of rural semi-arid region of Paraiba, raising dogs and the risk factors disclosed in the highlighted contact with birds and ecotopes operationalizing indicators to be watched and considered in the chain of transmission of the disease in the region.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease (ChD) will become predominantly a disease of the elderly, as a consequence of the effectiveness of control measures in many Latin American countries. The effects of the disease in old age have received little attention. We investigated the effects of ageing in the association between cardiac vagal impairment, a typical feature of ChD, and chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection.
   Methods: The study sample of this cross-sectional study consists of 1014 subjects >= 60 years old (mean age = 68.3; SD = 6.9) residing in Bambui City (Southeast Brazil). ECG was recorded and one-breath sinus arrhythmia test was performed. Maximal expiratory over the minimal inspiratory (E: I) ratio and heart rate variability (HRV) measurements were calculated. Ordinal logistic regression was used to assess the relation between vagal indexes and chronic T. cruzi infection.
   Results: The prevalence of T. cruzi infection was 32.0% and of major ECG abnormalities, 43.4%. Among individuals aged 60-69 years, T. cruzi infection was significantly and independently associated with reduced SDNN(OR 0.38; 95%CI 0.27-0.53), RMSSD(OR 0.48; 0.34-0.67) and EI: ratio (OR 0.45; 95%CI 0.33-0.63). Among individuals aged > 70 years, no significant odds ratios were found in either the unadjusted or the adjusted analysis. The presence of major ECG abnormalities did not affect the association between vagal indexes and T. cruzi infection.
   Conclusions: Disease-specific vagal cardiac dysfunction was observed in ChD individuals below 70. However, further ageing interferes significantly with vagal heart modulation, attenuating the difference of HRV indexes between ChD and non-ChD subjects. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Dogs are reservoir hosts for Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of American trypanosomiasis. A rapid immunochromatographic dipstick test (ICT) is available commercially for canine serological testing. The ICT was developed with the use of sera from South American dogs, but it is not routinely used in the United States. We evaluated the utility of the ICT in detecting anti T. cruzi antibodies in dogs from the United States. Dogs (N = 64) were experimentally infected with United States' isolates of T. cruzi from an opossum (Didelphis virginiana), an armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and a domestic dog ((Canis familiaris), and were tested after experimental infection. Sera from uninfected United States dogs (n = 79; hemaculture negative) were used as negative controls. In a blind study, sera were tested by the ICT and compared to the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test with the use of Brazil-strain epimastigotes as antigen. The sensitivity of the ICT was 91% and the specificity was 98% in dogs experimentally infected with United States isolates. Our study indicates that the ICT could be a useful screening tool for serological surveillance of canine T cruzi exposure in the United States.

AB  - Chagas disease was discovered by Carlos Chagas in 1909. Chagas worked at Oswaldo Cruz Institute, where the bases of experimental medicine were settled in Brazil, and that had no connection with the Faculty of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro. Chagas had several enemies at Oswaldo Cruz Institute mainly because of his election to Head of Service in 1910, and for the position of Oswaldo Cruz Directorship in 1917. Furthermore, Chagas gained enemies at Faculty of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro, which did not like to see the economical political autonomy of Oswaldo Cruz Institute. This allowed the Institute not only to perform top experimental research, but also to take the leadership of research in the country.
   Chagas was nominated to the Nobel Prize of 1921 in December, 1920. None was awarded the Nobel Prize in that year. He seems to have been evaluated by the Noble Committee of Karolinska Institute from March to May of 1921. At that time, his enemies were denying his discovery of Trypanosoma cruzi, a key point in Chagas' nomination by Karolinska Institute, and giving no epidemiological importance for the disease. By the same way, the obligation of small pox vaccination was tarnishing his public image. Having taken into account the epidemiologic importance of Chagas disease, the strong historical mistake in the process of Chagas evaluation, and the inequity behind all these facts, we insist on a posthumous Nobel Prize for the man who made the most complete medical-scientist discovery of all time.

AB  - Background: The Triatoma brasiliensis complex is a monophyletic group, comprising three species, one of which includes two subspecific taxa, distributed across 12 Brazilian states, in the caatinga and cerrado biomes. Members of the complex are diverse in terms of epidemiological importance, morphology, biology, ecology, and genetics. Triatoma b. brasiliensis is the most disease-relevant member of the complex in terms of epidemiology, extensive distribution, broad feeding preferences, broad ecological distribution, and high rates of infection with Trypanosoma cruzi; consequently, it is considered the principal vector of Chagas disease in northeastern Brazil.
   Methods: We used ecological niche models to estimate potential distributions of all members of the complex, and evaluated the potential for suitable adjacent areas to be colonized; we also present first evaluations of potential for climate change-mediated distributional shifts. Models were developed using the GARP and Maxent algorithms.
   Results: Models for three members of the complex (T. b. brasiliensis, N = 332; T. b. macromelasoma, N = 35; and T. juazeirensis, N = 78) had significant distributional predictivity; however, models for T. sherlocki and T. melanica, both with very small sample sizes (N = 7), did not yield predictions that performed better than random. Model projections onto future-climate scenarios indicated little broad-scale potential for change in the potential distribution of the complex through 2050.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that T. b. brasiliensis is the member of the complex with the greatest distributional potential to colonize new areas: overall; however, the distribution of the complex appears relatively stable. These analyses offer key information to guide proactive monitoring and remediation activities to reduce risk of Chagas disease transmission.

AB  - Background: Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, displays significant genetic variability revealed by six Discrete Typing Units (TcI-TcVI). In this pathology, oral transmission represents an emerging epidemiological scenario where different outbreaks associated to food/beverages consumption have been reported in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela. In Colombia, six human oral outbreaks have been reported corroborating the importance of this transmission route. Molecular epidemiology of oral outbreaks is barely known observing the incrimination of TcI, TcII, TcIV and TcV genotypes.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: High-throughput molecular characterization was conducted performing MLMT (Multilocus Microsatellite Typing) and mtMLST (mitochondrial Multilocus Sequence Typing) strategies on 50 clones from ten isolates. Results allowed observing the occurrence of TcI, TcIV and mixed infection of distinct TcI genotypes. Thus, a majority of specific mitochondrial haplotypes and allelic multilocus genotypes associated to the sylvatic cycle of transmission were detected in the dataset with the foreseen presence of mitochondrial haplotypes and allelic multilocus genotypes associated to the domestic cycle of transmission.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest the incrimination of sylvatic genotypes in the oral outbreaks occurred in Colombia. We observed patterns of super-infection and/or co-infection with a tailored association with the severe forms of myocarditis in the acute phase of the disease. The transmission dynamics of this infection route based on molecular epidemiology evidence was unraveled and the clinical and biological implications are discussed.

AB  - A century after the discovery of Trypanosoma cruzi in a child living in Lassance, Minas Gerais, Brazil in 1909, many uncertainties remain with respect to factors determining the pathogenesis of Chagas disease ( CD). Herein, we simultaneously investigate the contribution of both host and parasite factors during acute phase of infection in BALB/c mice infected with the JG and/or CL Brener T. cruzi strains. JG single infected mice presented reduced parasitemia and heart parasitism, no mortality, levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, CCL2, IL-6 and IFN-gamma) similar to those found among naive animals and no clinical manifestations of disease. On the other hand, CL Brener single infected mice presented higher parasitemia and heart parasitism, as well as an increased systemic release of pro-inflammatory mediators and higher mortality probably due to a toxic shock-like systemic inflammatory response. Interestingly, coinfection with JG and CL Brener strains resulted in intermediate parasitemia, heart parasitism and mortality. This was accompanied by an increase in the systemic release of IL-10 with a parallel increase in the number of MAC-3(+) and CD4(+) T spleen cells expressing IL-10. Therefore, the endogenous production of IL-10 elicited by coinfection seems to be crucial to counterregulate the potentially lethal effects triggered by systemic release of pro-inflammatory mediators induced by CL Brener single infection. In conclusion, our results suggest that the composition of the infecting parasite population plays a role in the host response to T. cruzi in determining the severity of the disease in experimentally infected BALB/c mice. The combination of JG and CL Brener was able to trigger both protective inflammatory immunity and regulatory immune mechanisms that attenuate damage caused by inflammation and disease severity in BALB/c mice.

   This study aimed to evidence the clinical and laboratorial signs of this disease to help characterize this illness in a natural way in the semiarid in the northeastern region. We evaluated 10 positive for Trypanosoma cruzi dogs, that were identified by serological analysis of immuno fluorescence assay (RIFI) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); molecular analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct microscopy and blood culture. The chagasic dogs underwent physical examination, electrocardiographic, radiographic, blood pressure, hematology (erythrocyte and leukocyte count) and biochemical exams (urea, creatinine, ALT, AST, PT, albumin, globulin, CK, CK-MB, and cTnl). The physical examination and the blood pressure were presented within the normal range, while in the electrocardiography the FC was observed as normal with a sinus rhythm, with the exception of one dog that presented a sinus tachycardia (168 bat/min). In the ECG of eight dogs there was increase of duration of P (47 +/- 6.5ms) suggestive to atrial enlargement, not confirmed in the radiography. A supraunlevelling was observed in the ST segment in one dog. In the hematological results, thrombocytopenia (187.4x10(3)+/- 137.2x10(3)) and anemia (5.0x10(6)+/- 1.39x10(6)/ul) were noted. The mean hemoglobin (11 +/- 2.7g/dL), hematocrit (34 +/- 10.5%) were below normal limits. The white series were within normal variation, with the exception of eosinophilia observed in three dogs. Individually, there were two dogs which registered leukocytosis, lymphocytosis and neutrophilia. In the biochemical evaluation there was hyperproteinemia PT=7.2 +/- 0.9g/dL, hypoalbuminemia (2.2 +/- 0.4g/dL), hyperglobulinemia (5.1 +/- 1.0g/dL), increased of CK (196+171 U/L) and there was no alteration on ALT and AST enzymes. The CK-MB isoenzymes and cTnI did not change, except in three dogs. We conclude that dogs naturally infected in the northeastern semiarid present characteristics related to indeterminate chronic form (asymptomatic dogs) and that the identification of the naturally infected dogs with no pathognomonic characteristics of the Chagas disease underscores the importance of this illness in the diagnostic process with the other profiles that show nonspecific or not associated to cardiovascular disease.

AB  - In this study, 222 genome survey sequences were generated for Trypanosoma rangeli strain P07 isolated from an opossum (Didelphis albiventris) in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. T. rangeli sequences were compared by BLASTX (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool X) analysis with the assembled contigs of Leishmania braziliensis, Leishmania infantum, Leishmania major, Trypanosoma brucei, and Trypanosoma cruzi. Results revealed that 82% (182/222) of the sequences were associated with predicted proteins described, whereas 18% (40/222) of the sequences did not show significant identity with sequences deposited in databases, suggesting that they may represent T. rangeli-specific sequences. Among the 182 predicted sequences, 179 (80.6%) had the highest similarity with T. cruzi, 2 (0.9%) with T. brucei, and 1 (0.5%) with L. braziliensis. Computer analysis permitted the identification of members of various gene families described for trypanosomatids in the genome of T. rangeli, such as trans-sialidases, mucin-associated surface proteins, and major surface proteases (MSP or gp63). This is the first report identifying sequences of the MSP family in T. rangeli. Multiple sequence alignments showed that the predicted MSP of T. rangeli presented the typical characteristics of metalloproteases, such as the presence of the HEXXH motif, which corresponds to a region previously associated with the catalytic site of the enzyme, and various cysteine and proline residues, which are conserved among MSPs of different trypanosomatid species. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the presence of MSP transcripts in epimastigote forms of T. rangeli.

AB  - Introduction: This work presents the initial findings of a molecular epidemiological investigation of Trypanosoma cruzi in triatomine insects in State of Mato Grosso do Sul. Methods: A total of 511 triatomines from different regions of the state were examined. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted from the intestinal contents of the insects using phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25: 24: 1). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers 121/122 targeting DNA kinetoplast (kDNA) was then performed to identify T. cruzi, and positive samples were subjected to PCR using the primer pair TcSC5D-F/R followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) with the restriction enzymes SphI and HpaI (1 U/reaction), cloning and sequencing. Results: One hundred samples were positive for T. cruzi, and three discrete typing units (DTUs) were identified (TcI, TcII, and TcBat). Triatoma sordida had the highest T. cruzi occurrence (83.3%), and DTUs were found in three samples: 58.3% of the samples were TcI, 33.3% were TcII and 8.3% were TcBat. There was a clear geographical distribution of the DTUs throughout the state, with TcI, TcII and TcBat located in the center, TcI located in the east, and TcII located in the west. Conclusions: This study showed the occurrence of overlapping DTUs in State of Mato Grosso do Sul. The distributions of the DTUs were different, with TcI, TcII and TcBat in the center of the state, TcI predominantly in the east, and TcII in the west. Further studies may reveal a more defined mosaic distribution of DTUs in MS.

AB  - This study presents the electrocardiogram findings from 97 captive tufted capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) at the Sao Paulo Zoo (Sao Paulo, Brazil) while under ketamine anesthesia. The results did not differ greatly from data of domestic carnivores or other studied primate species. The most common rhythm recorded was normal sinus rhythm, followed by normal sinus rhythm with wandering pacemaker. Electrical axis varied from 0 degrees to -150 degrees but was most commonly between +60 degrees and +90 degrees. QRS complexes were predominantly positive in leads DI, DII, DIII, and AVF. These findings allow for the recognition of abnormal rhythms in these primate species and can contribute to future investigations into the cardiovascular diseases routinely diagnosed in primates and humans.

AB  - Little is known on the role played by Neotropical wild carnivores in the Trypanosoma cruzi transmission cycles. We investigated T. cruzi infection in wild carnivores from three sites in Brazil through parasitological and serological tests. The seven carnivore species examined were infected by T. cruzi, but high parasitemias detectable by hemoculture were found only in two Procyonidae species. Genotyping by Mini-exon gene, PCR-RFLP (1f8/Akw21I) and kDNA genomic targets revealed that the raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus) harbored TcI and the coatis (Nasua nasua) harbored TcI, TcII, TcIII-IV and Trypanosoma rangeli, in single and mixed infections, besides four T. cruzi isolates that displayed odd band patterns in the Mini-exon assay. These findings corroborate the coati can be a bioaccumulator of T. cruzi Discrete Typing Units (DTU) and may act as a transmission hub, a connection point joining sylvatic transmission cycles within terrestrial and arboreal mammals and vectors. Also, the odd band patterns observed in coatis' isolates reinforce that T. cruzi diversity might be much higher than currently acknowledged. Additionally, we assembled our data with T. cruzi infection on Neotropical carnivores' literature records to provide a comprehensive analysis of the infection patterns among distinct carnivore species, especially considering their ecological traits and phylogeny. Altogether, fifteen Neotropical carnivore species were found naturally infected by T. cruzi. Species diet was associated with T. cruzi infection rates, supporting the hypothesis that predator-prey links are important mechanisms for T. cruzi maintenance and dispersion in the wild. Distinct T. cruzi infection patterns across carnivore species and study sites were notable. Musteloidea species consistently exhibit high parasitemias in different studies which indicate their high infectivity potential. Mesocarnivores that feed on both invertebrates and mammals, including the coati, a host that can be bioaccumulator of T. cruzi DTU's, seem to take place at the top of the T. cruzi transmission chain.

AB  - Due to the scarcity of evidence of sexuality in Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, it has been general accepted that the parasite reproduction is essentially clonal with infrequent genetic recombination. This assumption is mainly supported by indirect evidence, such as Hardy-Weinberg imbalances, linkage disequilibrium and a strong correlation between independent sets of genetic markers of T. cruzi populations. However, because the analyzed populations are usually isolated from different geographic regions, the possibility of population substructuring as generating these genetic marker imbalances cannot be eliminated. To investigate this possibility, we firstly compared the allele frequencies and haplotype networks using seven different polymorphic loci (two from mitochondrial and five from different nuclear chromosomes) in two groups of TcII strains: one including isolates obtained from different regions in Latin America and the other including isolates obtained only from patients of the Minas Gerais State in Brazil. Our hypothesis was that if the population structure is essentially clonal, Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium and a sharp association between the clusters generated by analyzing independent markers should be observed in both strain groups, independent of the geographic origin of the samples. The results demonstrated that the number of microsatellite loci in linkage disequilibrium decreased from 4 to 1 when only strains from Minas Gerais were analyzed. Moreover, we did not observed any correlation between the clusters when analyzing the nuclear and mitochondrial loci, suggesting independent inheritance of these markers among the Minas Gerais strains. Besides, using a second subset of five physically linked microsatellite loci and the Minas Gerais strains, we could also demonstrate evidence of homologous recombination roughly proportional to the relative distance among them. Taken together, our results do not support a clonal population structure for T. cruzi, particularly in TcII, which coexists in the same geographical area, suggesting that genetic exchanges among these strains may occur more frequently than initially expected.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the agreement of four renowned interaction lists on potentially severe warfarin drug interactions (DI) in outpatients at a university hospital in Brazil, specifically in subgroups of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected and non-infected patients and those with previous bleeding episodes.
   This was a cross-sectional study in which adult outpatients with heart disease and indications for chronic warfarin use were enrolled. The occurrence of potentially severe warfarin DI was evaluated based on the lists provided by three compendia, i.e., Drug Interaction Facts (DIF), Drug Interactions: Analysis and Management (DIAM) and DRUG-REAX, and by the World Health Organization (WHO) Model Formulary. A kappa coefficient was used to calculate the agreement among the sources.
   A total of 280 patients were studied. Most patients were female (54.6 %) with an average age of 56.8 (standard deviation 13.1) years. The agreement among the four sources was fair (Fleiss' kappa coefficient = 0.295). T. cruzi-infected individuals were less likely to have severe warfarin DI than non-infected patients (p < 0.05 for DIAM, DRUG-REAX and the WHO Model Formulary). Potentially severe DI were more frequent in patients with previous bleeding episodes, based on the DIF compendia (p = 0.007).
   This evaluation of warfarin DI revealed that the disagreement between compendia is also observed in clinical practice. T. cruzi infection is associated with a lower prevalence of potentially severe warfarin DI, but with a wider variation in its detection. Our results suggest a wide spectrum of discrepancies in detecting heart disease patients at higher risk for severe warfarin DI and a possible heterogeneity in clinical guidance.

AB  - In earlier studies, we reported that a heterologous prime-boost regimen using recombinant plasmid DNA followed by replication-defective adenovirus vector, both containing Trypanosoma cruzi genes encoding trans-sialidase (TS) and amastigote surface protein (ASP) 2, provided protective immunity against experimental infection with a reticulotropic strain of this human protozoan parasite. Herein, we tested the outcome of genetic vaccination of F1 (CB10XBALB/c) mice challenged with myotropic parasite strains (Brazil and Colombian). Initially, we determined that the coadministration during priming of a DNA plasmid containing the murine IL-12 gene improved the immune response and was essential for protective immunity elicited by the heterologous prime-boost regimen in susceptible male mice against acute lethal infections with these parasites. The prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination of resistant female mice led to a drastic reduction in the number of inflammatory infiltrates in cardiac and skeletal muscles during the chronic phase of infection with either strain. Analysis of the electrocardiographic parameters showed that prophylactic vaccination reduced the frequencies of sinus arrhythmia and atrioventricular block. Our results confirmed that prophylactic vaccination using the TS and ASP-2 genes benefits the host against acute and chronic pathologies caused by T. cruzi and should be further evaluated for the development of a veterinary or human vaccine against Chagas disease.

AB  - CD8(+) T cells are essential for controlling Trypanosoma cruzi infection. During Brazil strain infection, C57BL/6 mice expand parasite-specific CD8(+) T cells recognizing the dominant TSKB20 (ANYKFTLV) and subdominant TSKB74 (VNYDFTLV) trans-sialidase gene (TS)-encoded epitopes with up to 40% of all CD8(+) T cells specific for these epitopes. Although this is one of the largest immunodominant T cell responses described for any infection, most mice fail to clear T. cruzi and subsequently develop chronic disease. To determine if immunodominant TS-specific CD8(+) T cells are necessary for resistance to infection, we epitope-tolerized mice by high-dose i.v. injections of TSKB20 or TSKB74 peptides. Tolerance induction led to deletion of TS-specific CD8(+) T cells but did not prevent the expansion of other effector CD8(+) T cell populations. Mice tolerized against either TSKB20 or TSKB74, or both epitopes simultaneously, exhibited transient increases in parasite loads, although ultimately they controlled the acute infection. Furthermore, BALB/c mice tolerized against the TSKD14 peptide effectively controlled acute T. cruzi infection. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that development of high-frequency CD8(+) T cell populations focused on TS-derived epitopes contributes to optimal control of acute infection but is not required for the development of immune resistance.

AB  - Introduction: In this study, we evaluated the seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection among chagasic and non-chagasic subjects as well as among the subgroups of chagasic patients with the indeterminate, cardiac, digestive, and cardiodigestive clinical forms. Methods: The evaluated subjects were from the Triangulo Mineiro region, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Chagasic patients showed positive reactions to the conventional serological tests used and were classified according to the clinical form of their disease. Immunoglobulin G antibodies specific to H. pylori were measured using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Results: The overall H. pylori prevalence was 77.1% (239/310) in chagasic and 69.1% (168/243) in non-chagasic patients. This difference was statistically significant even after adjustment for age and sex (odds ratio = 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.42; p = 0.04) in multivariate analysis. The prevalence of infection increased with age in the non-chagasic group (p = 0.007, chi(2) for trend), but not in the chagasic group (p = 0.15, chi(2) for trend). H. pylori infection was not associated with digestive or other clinical forms of Chagas disease (p = 0.27). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that chagasic patients have a higher prevalence of H. pylori compared to non-chagasic subjects; a similar prevalence was found among the diverse clinical forms of the disease. The factors contributing to the frequent co-infection with H. pylori and Trypanosoma cruzi as well as its effects on the clinical outcome deserve further study.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease, caused by infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, remains a serious public health issue in Latin America. Genetically diverse, the species is sub-divided into six lineages, known as TcI-TcVI, which have disparate geographical and ecological distributions. TcII, TcV, and TcVI are associated with severe human disease in the Southern Cone countries, whereas TcI is associated with cardiomyopathy north of the Amazon. T. cruzi persists as a chronic infection, with cardiac and/or gastrointestinal symptoms developing years or decades after initial infection. Identifying an individual's history of T. cruzi lineage infection directly by genotyping of the parasite is complicated by the low parasitaemia and sequestration in the host tissues.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We have applied here serology against lineage-specific epitopes of the T. cruzi surface antigen TSSA, as an indirect approach to allow identification of infecting lineage. Chagasic sera from chronic patients from a range of endemic countries were tested by ELISA against synthetic peptides representing lineage-specific TSSA epitopes bound to avidin-coated ELISA plates via a biotin labelled polyethylene glycol-glycine spacer to increase rotation and ensure each amino acid side chain could freely interact with their antibodies. 79/113 (70%) of samples from Brazil, Bolivia, and Argentina recognised the TSSA epitope common to lineages TcII/TcV/TcVI. Comparison with clinical information showed that a higher proportion of Brazilian TSSApep-II/V/VI responders had ECG abnormalities than non-responders (38% vs 17%; p<0.0001). Among northern chagasic sera 4/20 (20%) from Ecuador reacted with this peptide; 1/12 Venezuelan and 1/34 Colombian samples reacted with TSSApep-IV. In addition, a proposed TcI-specific epitope, described elsewhere, was demonstrated here to be highly conserved across lineages and therefore not applicable to lineage-specific serology.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results demonstrate the considerable potential for synthetic peptide serology to investigate the infection history of individuals, geographical and clinical associations of T. cruzi lineages.

AB  - The genetic variability of 24 Trypanosoma cruzi isolates from humans (11) and triatomines (13) in northeastern Brazil was analyzed by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and compared with taxonomic groups, host, and geographical origin of the parasite. TcI (12.5 %), TcII (45.8 %), and TcIII (41.6 %) showed a similarity coefficient (SC) of 0.74 using the mean of three primers and 0.80, 0.75, and 0.66 for lambda gt11-F, M13-40F, and L15996 primers, respectively. The samples were clustered according to their phylogenetic origin in two polymorphic and divergent branches: one associated with TcI and the other with two subbranches corresponding to TcII and TcIII. TcI was only identified in humans and correlated with the Id homogenous group (0.80 SC). TcII from humans and Triatoma brasiliensis showed 0.86 SC and was clustered according monoclonal or polyclonal populations with similar RAPD profiles detected among the vector and/or humans in different municipalities. TcIII was isolated exclusively in sylvatic cycles from T. brasiliensis and Panstrongylus lutzi and showed low variability (0.84 SC) and high homology mainly among isolated populations at the same locality. The homology of T. cruzi among different hosts and locations suggests the distribution of principal clones circulating and reveals an overlapping between the sylvatic and domestic cycles in this area, where T. brasiliensis infected with TcII acts as link in both environments. This species is important to maintain TcII and TcIII in wild cycles and deserves particular attention due an emergent risk of these populations being introduced into the domestic cycle; moreover, its clinical and epidemiological implications remain unknown.

TI  - Trypanosoma cruzi infection: do distinct populations cause intestinal motility alteration?
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH

KW  - EXPRESSION
KW  - MICE
AB  - Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is an important public health problem in Latin America. Disturbances in gastrointestinal motility are observed in 15-20% of patients at the chronic phase. We previously observed a decrease in intestinal motility in mice infected with Y strain from T. cruzi. Thus, we decided to test if infection with other T. cruzi strains also caused the intestinal disturbance. Male adult Swiss mice were infected intraperitoneally with CL-Brener clone (CL-B), Brazil strain (Br), or Dm28 clone (Dm) of T. cruzi. All infected mice presented a low cumulative mortality (CL-B, 17%; Br, 8%; Dm, 25%) at 35 days post infection (dpi) and their typical parasitemia curves. Br and Dm groups exhibited a maximal reduction of intestinal motility at 35 dpi (176.8 +/- 51.3 and 198.3 +/- 52.6 min, respectively), when compared with non-infected mice (90.2 +/- 19.5 min). However, CL mice presented the peak of delayed intestinal transit at 12 dpi (191.0 +/- 33.3 min), when compared with non-infected mice (105.6 +/- 26.4 min), very close to the 15 dpi for the intense alteration (310.2 +/- 67.4 min) observed with the Y strain. We clearly demonstrate a reduction in intestinal motility in mice infected with different groups of T. cruzi during the acute phase of the infection. Since Br, Dm, and CL strains presented low mortality rates in adult Swiss mice, a prospective study concerning the chronic intestinal alteration is encouraged, particularly for studies of alternative therapies.

AB  - A total of 179 individuals with acute Chagas disease mainly transmitted by oral source, from Para and Amapa State, Amazonian, Brazil were included during the period from 1988 to 2005. Blood samples were used to survey peripheral blood for T. cruzi hemoparasites by quantitative buffy coat (QBC), indirect xenodiagnosis, blood culture and serology to detection of total IgM and anti-T. cruzi IgG antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and indirect hemagglutination assay (HA). All assays were performed pre-treatment (0 days) and repeated 35 (+/- 7) and 68 (+/- 6) days after the initiation of treatment with benznidazol and every 6 months while remained seropositive. The endpoint of collection was performed in 2005. Total medium period of follow-up per person was 5.6 years. Also, a blood sample was collected from 72 randomly chosen treated patients to perform polimerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Proportions of subjects with negative or positive serology according to the number of years after treatment were compared. In the endpoint of follow-up we found 47 patients (26.7%) serologically negative, therefore considered cured and 5 (2.7%) exhibited mild cardiac Chagas disease. Other 132 patients had persistent positive serologic tests. The PCR carried out in 72 individuals was positive in 9.8%. Added, there was evidence of therapeutic failure immediately following treatment, as demonstrated by xenodiagnosis and blood culture methods in 2.3% and 3.5% of cases, respectively. There was a strong evidence of antibody clearing in the fourth year after treatment and continuous decrease of antibody titers. Authors suggest that control programs should apply operational researches with new drug interventions four years after the acute phase for those treated patients with persistently positive serology.

AB  - Introduction: This work aimed to analyze the triatom ine infestation scenario in Jaboticatubas after 30 years of the uninterrupted actions of the Program of Chagas Disease Control. Methods: From 2007 to 2010, household unit infestation was researched, and an exploratory analysis of the localities infested with Panstrongylus megistus was performed. Results: In total, 613 triatomines were captured in 78 households, the majority of which were Panstrongylus megistus and were captured mainly in chicken houses, but they were also found to be colonizing human houses. Conclusions: The epidemiological importance of Panstrongylus megistus was confi rmed in Jaboticatubas, and capability to colonize indoors has been demonstrated, as has its proximity to humans. Its distribution is aggregated in the northern and in central-eastern regions of the municipality.

AB  - Introduction: Trypanosoma cruzi-infected specimens of Triatoma costalimai have been detected in domiciliary units of Central Brazil, thereby maintaining the potential risk of vectorial transmission of Chagas disease. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and natural infection of T. costalimai in different environments (gallery forest, dry forest and peridomicile) and climatic seasons (wet and dry), in the municipality of Mambai, State of Goias, Brazil. Methods: Triatomines were captured in October 2010 and in June 2011, employing two different methods (manual capture and mouse-baited adhesive traps). The insects were later separated by sex and nymphal stage, counted and examined parasitologically by abdominal compression and microscopic analysis of feces. Results: Triatoma costalimai was found in three environments and in the two seasons studied. Overall, capture success of 900 traps and 60 blocks of rocks inspected was 5.8% and 11.7%, respectively. The occurrence of T. costalimai was higher among rocks in the peridomicile, where 97% of the 131 specimens were captured. The proportion of nymphs (98%) was much higher than that of adults, which were only detected in peridomicile. Most (95%) insects were captured during the wet season, with predominance of early-stage nymphs. None of the 43 specimens examined were infected by trypanosomatids. Conclusions: The results indicate a greater occurrence of T. costalimai in peridomiciliary environments and during the wet season in Mambai, Goias, highlighting the synanthropic behavior of this triatomine species in one area of the Brazilian savanna and the importance of entomological surveillance.

AB  - After several public notifications of domiciliary invasions, palm trees were investigated in downtown Monte Alto City, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, in proximity to the city hall building, the main church, condominiums and marketing establishments. One hundred seventy four palm trees of 10 species were investigated, in which 72 specimens of Rhodnius neglectus, a potential Chagas disease vector, were captured via manual methods. All insects were collected from dead leaves, organic debris and bird nests in the only three Livistona australis palm trees in the central park square. This was the first record of R. neglectus colonizing this palm species. Although no Trypanosoma cruzi was found by abdominal compression followed by light microscopy, the poor nutritional status of the bugs hampered the examination of gut contents for parasite detection. Furthermore, the central crowns of the trees, which shelter bats (Chiroptera: Mammalia), could not be carefully searched for insects due to difficult access. This new finding highlights the sudden alteration in insect behavior, probably as a result of man's interference. This report aims to warn those involved in the health system about this new threat, justifying detailed research of the area to evaluate the magnitude of this emerging public health issue.

AB  - Description of eggs and nymphs of Triatoma klugi (Hemiptera, Reduviidae, Triatominae). The authors had described the morphologic characteristics of Triatoma klugi Carcavallo, Jurberg, Lent & Galvao, 2001 to the group of species belonging to "T. oliveirai complex". Until the moment it has been difficult to separate on the nymphs characteristics basis these species, what it justifies the development of this work. The specimens had been collected in openings of rocks in the Malavok mount in the locality of Linha Brazil, city of Nova Petropolis, in the State of Rio Grande do Sul. The local of capture of the Triatominae is placed enters 700 and 800 m of altitud (29 degrees 18'38 '' S, 51 degrees 04'57 '' W). Together with T. oliveirai (Neiva, Pinto & Lent, 1939), its morphologically related species, is the only ones of the complex that had not been found, until the moment, in the State of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and Goias, Brazil. In experimental conditions, already it was tested and proven its susceptibilities to the infection for Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas, 1909) and Trypanosoma rangeli (Tejera, 1920). The comparative analysis of the ornaments of the exocorium of eggs and of three nymphs of T. klugi by optic microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed some morphologic particularities, with prominence for: the ventral face of the head, the stridulatory sulcus and the last abdominal segments (IX, X - future genitalia and XI - anal duct). These data contribute for the magnifying of the distinguishing parameters aiming at diagnosis of T. klugi during its nymphal development.

AB  - The species Triatoma melanocephala and T. vitticeps are vectors of Chagas disease in Brazil. An analysis of the number of chromosomes has led to the proposal of the exclusion of both these species and T. tibiamaculata from the Brasiliensis subcomplex because of their similarities to the triatomines of North America. T. melanocephala has been found to have morphologic characteristics that are very similar to those of T. vitticeps, and these species have been considered synonymous. Thus, this paper analyzes the spermiogenesis of T. melanocephala and T. vitticeps in order to compare the two and to evaluate another possible relationship between the species. This study describes spermatogenesis and observes the morphology, cell size, and cytogenetic characteristics of triatomines. In all T. melanocephala cells, a slightly prominent peripheral heteropyknotic filament was observed. In T. vitticeps, an extensive peripheral heteropyknotic filament was observed in spermatids. This filament was observed in either the periphery or the middle of the cell. Thus, this paper describes the spermiogenesis stage of two cryptic species of triatomines and suggests that the central heteropyknotic filament can be used as a tool in the diagnosis of T. vitticeps as a vector of Chagas disease.

AB  - Triatoma brasiliensis is considered one of the main vectors of Chagas disease commonly found in semi-arid areas of northeastern Brazil. These insects use proteases, such as carboxypeptidase B, aminopeptidases and different cathepsins for blood digestion. In the present study, two genes encoding cathepsin L from the midgut of T. brasiliensis were identified and characterized. Mature T. brasiliensis cathepsin L-like proteinases (TBCATL-1, TBCATL-2) showed a high level of identity to the cathepsin L-like proteinases of other insects, with highest similarity to Rhodnius prolixus. Both cathepsin L transcripts were highly abundant in the posterior midgut region, the main region of the blood digestion. Determination of the pH in the whole intestine of unfed T. brasiliensis revealed alkaline conditions in the anterior midgut region (stomach) and acidic conditions in the posterior midgut region (small intestine). Gelatine in-gel zymography showed the activity of at least four distinct proteinases in the small intestine and the cysteine proteinase inhibitors transepoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64) and cathepsin B inhibitor and N-(L-3-trans-propylcarbamoyl-oxirane-2-carbonyl)-L-isoleucyl-L-proline (CA-074) were employed to characterize enzymatic activity. E-64 fully inhibited cysteine proteinase activity, whereas in the samples treated with CA-074 residual proteinase activity was detectable. Thus, proteolytic activity could at least partially be ascribed to cathepsin L Western blot analysis using specific anti cathepsin L antibodies confirmed the presence of cathepsin L in the lumen of the small intestine of the insects.

   On the American continent, almost 15 million people are affected by Chagas disease, resulting in important economic and social damages. Dogs are considered to be an excellent experimental model to study Chagas' disease; as a result, in this research, the characterization of cardiovascular abnormalities was performed in dogs experimentally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi (the Colombian strain) that were at chronic stage. Thirteen adult female dogs were evaluated by electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, hematological and biochemical analyses in the chronic phase. For the electrocardiographic studies, respiratory sinus arrhythmia was the predominant rhythm during the entire research period (49.55% to 67%), with a low prevalence of right bundle branch block (0-13%) and first-degree atrioventricular block (0-14%). The spectral Doppler echocardiography showed E and A mitral wave reversal (0.71 +/- 0.17), confirming the diastolic dysfunction present in all dogs. An increase in the enzymes activities was detected in the serum analysis, indicating myocardial injury by the infection. Six dogs died during the follow-up. In this way, the clinical characterization of experimentally infected dogs, as described here, increases the knowledge and allows for recognition of the behavioural modifications present in Chagas' disease in affected dogs.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease kills 2.5 thousand people per year of 15 million persons infected in Latin America. The disease is caused by the protozoan, Trypanosome cruzi, and vectored by triatomine insects, including Panstrongylus megistus, an important vector in Brazil. Medicines treating Chagas disease have unpleasant side effects and may be ineffective, therefore, alternative control techniques are required. Knowledge of the T. cruzi interactions with the triatomine host needs extending and new targets/strategies for control identified. Serine and cysteine peptidases play vital roles in protozoan life cycles including invasion and entry of T. cruzi into host cells. Peptidase inhibitors are, therefore, promising targets for disease control.
   Methods: SDS PAGE and chromatograpy detected and isolated a P. megistus serpin which was peptide sequenced by mass spectrometry. A full amino acid sequence was obtained from the cDNA and compared with other insect serpins. Reverse transcription PCR analysis measured serpin transcripts of P. megistus tissues with and without T. cruzi infection. Serpin homology modeling used the Swiss Model and Swiss-PDB viewer programmes.
   Results: The P. megistus serpin (PMSRP1) has a ca. 40 kDa molecular mass with 404 amino acid residues. A reactive site loop contains a highly conserved hinge region but, based on sequence alignment, the normal cleavage site for serine proteases at P1-P1' was translocated to the putative position P4'-P5'. A small peptide obtained corresponded to the C-terminal 40 amino acid region. The secondary structure of PMSRP1 indicated nine a-helices and three beta-sheets, similar to other serpins. PMSRP1 transcripts occurred in all tested tissues but were highest in the fat body and hemocytes. Levels of mRNA encoding PMSRP1 were significantly modulated in the hemocytes and stomach by T. cruzi infection indicating a role for PMSRP1 in the parasite interactions with P. megistus.
   Conclusions: For the first time, a constitutively expressed serpin has been characterized from the hemolymph of a triatomine. This opens up new research avenues into the roles of serine peptidases in the T. cruzi/P. megistus association. Initial experiments indicate a role for PMSRP1 in T. cruzi interactions with P. megistus and will lead to further functional studies of this molecule.

AB  - Introduction: Despite of indoor insect control measures, American trypanosomiasis cases still occur, with the participation of both peridomestic and sylvan species. One of these species is Rhodnius robustus, which has been found naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma rangeli.
   Objective: To describe the feeding behavior of R. robustus under laboratory conditions.
   Materials and methods: We analyzed time spent for repletion, the number of defecations, the percentage and number of times insects defecated during blood intake, and the weight gained after blood feeding in each nymph stage of R. robustus.
   Results: Repletion for R. robustus took between 19:26 to 44:55 (minutes:seconds) and all nymph stages defecated during blood feeding. The proportion of individuals which defecated during blood feeding varied between 13.3% and 93.3%. On the other hand, the highest average blood intake was observed in the fifth stage (337.19 mg), which is twice the blood intake of adults (161.25 mg).
   Conclusions: All stages of R. robustus dejected during blood feeding, which is an important factor for its vectorial competence. Nevertheless, the time prior to the first dejection, the percentage of dejections and number of individuals that dejected upon blood feeding, as well as the amount of ingested blood varied among stages, which means that feeding behavior is mediated by variables depending on age/stage.

AB  - Background: Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy is an inflammatory disease that occurs in approximately 30% of patients infected by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, and it has a profile of high morbidity and mortality. The worst prognosis and the progression of this cardiomyopathy are associated with an exacerbated immune response and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which also occur in other cardiomyopathies. Some nutrients, including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), promote the inhibition and/or stimulation of cytokine production. The objective of this trial is to study the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on the inflammatory response and lipid profile in patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy.
   Methods/Design: This is a parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial with 40 patients that will be conducted at a reference unit for Chagas disease patients, where the patients will be selected. The study will include patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy who are 18 years of age or older. The exclusion criteria are (a) ongoing diarrheal disease, (b) inflammatory bowel disease, (c) diabetes or other endocrine disease, (d) use of fibrates, niacin, or statins, (e) use of anti-inflammatory drugs, (f) pregnant and lactating women, (g) use of vitamin, mineral, or omega-3 supplementation during the previous 30 days, (h) hospital admission during the study, and (i) other associated cardiomyopathies. The intervention will be treatment with omega-3 PUFAs at a dose of 3 g/day for 8 weeks, compared to placebo (corn oil). The primary endpoints will be the concentrations of inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, interferon (IFN)gamma, and transforming growth factor (TGF)beta). Secondary endpoints will be the fasting glucose, lipid, and anthropometric profiles. For statistical analysis, we plan to run either a t test or Wilcoxon test (numerical variables) and Pearson's chi(2) or Fisher's exact test (categorical data), as appropriate.
   Discussion: Evidence suggests that the anti-inflammatory action of omega-3 PUFAs may have beneficial effects on chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, as shown for other cardiomyopathies, due to improved control of the inflammatory response. At the end of the study, we predict that patients will have lower inflammatory markers and an improved metabolic and anthropometric profile.

AB  - Trypanosoma lewisi is a cosmopolitan species originally found in Rattus spp., being nonpathogenic, host-restricted, and transmitted by rat fleas. This species has been recorded as an opportunist blood parasite of human beings mainly in Asia, with a case in Africa. In Brazil, this species was recently recorded in captive monkeys. As T. lewisi can share vertebrate hosts both with Trypanosoma rangeli and Trypanosoma cruzi, some markers for the differential diagnosis of these species were examined and discussed herein. The identification of T. lewisi was based on morphological features of bloodstream stages at the initial phase of infection in mammals, isoenzyme electrophoresis at the MDH locus, and PCR products of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) minicircles using the primers TC121/TC122.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of anti-Trypanosomacruzi low-level reactive samples is incompletely understood. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive rates and antibody levels among seropositive blood donors in three countries are described. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Follow-up samples were collected from T.cruzi-seropositive donors from 2008 through 2010 in the United States (n=195) and Honduras (n=58). Also 143 samples from Brazil in 1996 to 2002, originally positive by three serologic assays, were available and paired with contemporary follow-up samples from these donors. All samples were retested with Ortho enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). PCR assays were performed on coded sample panels by two laboratories (Blood Systems Research Institute [BSRI] and American Red Cross Holland Laboratory [ARC]) that amplified kinetoplast minicircle DNA sequences of T.cruzi. RESULTS: PCR testing at BSRI yielded slightly higher overall sensitivity and specificity (33 and 98%) compared with those at the ARC (28 and 94%). Among seropositive donors, PCR-positive rates varied by country (p<0.0001) for the BSRI laboratory: Brazil (57%), Honduras (32%), and the United States (14%). ELISA signal-to-cutoff ratios (S/CO) were significantly higher for PCR-positive compared to PCR-negative donors (p<0.05 for all comparisons). Additionally, PCR-negative Brazilian donors exhibited greater frequencies of antibody decline over time versus PCR-positive donors (p=0.003). CONCLUSION: For all three countries, persistent DNA positivity correlated with higher ELISA S/CO values, suggesting that high-level seroreactivity reflects chronic parasitemia. Significant S/CO declines in 10% of the PCR-negative Brazilian donors may indicate seroreversion after parasite clearance in the absence of treatment.

AB  - In order to mark Triatoma brasiliensis, the vector of Chagas disease in Brazil, two chemical compounds, rubidium chloride (RbCl) and chromium chloride (CrCl3), were tested. First, 199 N2-N5 nymphs were fed on blood with 0.025M RbCl. Rb marker positivity ranged from 2.5% (N3)-70% (N2), with a maximum persistence of 98 days. Second, 265 N2-N5 nymphs were fed on blood containing 0.0015M CrCl3. Cr marker positivity ranged up to 93% (N5), with a maximum persistence of 119 days. Finally, we blood fed 213 T. brasiliensis to investigate whether CrCl3 altered the biology of this insect. The developmental time of T. brasiliensis was unaltered, but the survival of the Cr-marked group was lower than that of the control group. Differences in the mean fecundity of the control (mean of 156.1) and experimental (mean of 135.6) groups were not statistically significant and 100% of the egg batches of females Cr-marked as nymphs were positive. In conclusion, CrCl3 is a useful tool for marking T. brasiliensis nymphs due to its high positivity and persistence.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii infects humans through the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), which elicits humoral immune response with specific antibodies. The expression of the ABO blood group glycoconjugates also occurs in this same system and may influence the human susceptibility of infection by T. gondii. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between ABO blood group phenotypes and the presence of anti-T. gondii antibodies. Data - including age, results of serology tests for T. gondii infection and ABO blood group phenotypes - were assembled from the medical records of 1,006 pregnant women attended in the Base Hospital of the Medical School of Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Brazil, between 2001 and 2004. The chi-square test was used to compare the results with the level of significance set at 5%. Of the studied cases, 64.1% (645/1006) and 35.9% (391/1006) presented respectively positive and negative serology tests for anti-T. gondii antibodies. The mean age of those who tested positive was higher than those with negative serology tests (p = 0.0004). The frequencies of ABO blood group phenotypes were similar in those with and without anti-T. gondii antibodies (p = 0.35). In conclusion, the ABO blood group system is not associated with the presence or absence of anti-T. gondii antibodies.

AB  - Vectorial, transfusion and congenital are considered the main transmission mechanisms in human Chagas disease. Alternative mechanisms are accidental, oral and by organ transplantation. Other hypothetic mechanisms could be by other vectors, sexual, criminal and by means of marsupial anal secretions. The present accorded strategies for prevention are: Congenital: early case detection and immediate treatment. If possible, start during the pre natal period, throughout mothers serology, performing parasitological tests in the new born from positive women. For positive cases, immediate treatment; for those negative babies, conventional serology at the 8(th) month, treating specifically those with positive results. Accidental transmission: Rigorous training and utilization of protection equipments. IF accident occurs, immediate disinfection, conventional serology and beginning of specific treatment by ten days. Revision of the serology after 30 days: if positive, extend the treatment until the total dose (60 days or more). Organ transplantation: previous serology for donor and receptor. When the former is infected and the last negative, cancel the surgery or install the specific treatment by ten days before the surgery for the donor, followed by the receptor during ten days after the transplantation. Oral transmission: Specific measures are not available, food hygiene is recommended, including the cooking of meats delivered from possible reservoirs. Nowadays, the detection and immediate treatment of the case is recommended, followed by active research of new cases around the detected one.

AB  - Triatoma brasiliensis is an important vector of Trypanosoma cruzi in the semiarid zones of Northeastern Brazil where it is commonly found in human dwellings, peridomiciliary areas, and the wild environments. To better understand features that may be influencing the interaction of T. brasiliensis with its hosts, in the present work we compared the feeding performance of sylvatic and domestic populations of T. brasiliensis on humans and on Thrichomys laurentius, a wild rodent found in the natural ecotopes of T. brasiliensis. The analyses were performed using the electronic monitoring of the cibarial pump. The blood sources considerably affected the feeding parameters. Insects fed on T. laurentius had lower ingestion rate, gained less weight, had longer interruption time, remained less time in contact with the host, and had the contractions of the pump in a lower frequency during the feeding process in comparison to insects fed on humans. These results indicate that humans are better blood sources for T. brasiliensis than T. laurentius. The fact that there was no difference between the feeding performance of sylvatic and domestic insects suggests that feeding is not a barrier for the domiciliation. Together, these findings suggest that shelter and faster blood meals are qualities of human dwellings that facilitate the domiciliation of T. brasiliensis.

AB  - Introduction: The use of entomopathogenic fungi to control disease vectors has become relevant because traditional chemical control methods have caused damage to the environment and led to the development of resistance among vectors. Thus, this study assessed the pathogenicity of entomopathogenic fungi in Triatoma dimidiata. Methods: Preparations of 10(8) conidia/ml of Gliocladium virens, Talaromyces flavus, Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae were applied topically on T. dimidiata nymphs and adults. Controls were treated with the 0.0001% Tween-80 vehicle. Mortality was evaluated and recorded daily for 30 days. The concentration required to kill 50% of T. dimidiata (LC50) was then calculated for the most pathogenic isolate. Results: Pathogenicity in adults was similar among B. bassiana, G. virens and T. flavus (p > 0.05) and differed from that in triatomine nymphs (p = 0.009). The most entomopathogenic strains in adult triatomines were B. bassiana and G. virens, which both caused 100% mortality. In nymphs, the most entomopathogenic strain was B. bassiana, followed by G. virens. The native strain with the highest pathogenicity was G. virens, for which the LC50 for T. dimidiata nymphs was 1.98 x10(8) conidia/ml at 13 days after inoculation. Conclusions: Beauveria bassiana and G. virens showed entomopathogenic potential in T. dimidiata nymphs and adults. However, the native G. virens strain presents a higher probability of success in the field, and G. virens should thus be considered a potential candidate for the biological control of triatomine Chagas disease vectors.

AB  - Accurately defining disease distributions and calculating disease risk is an important step in the control and prevention of diseases. Geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing technologies, with maximum entropy (Maxent) ecological niche modelling computer software, were used to create predictive risk maps for Chagas disease in Bolivia. Prevalence rates were calculated from 2007 to 2009 household infection survey data for Bolivia, while environmental data were compiled from the Worldclim database and MODIS satellite imagery. Socio-economic data were obtained from the Bolivian National Institute of Statistics. Disease models identified altitudes at 500-3,500 m above the mean sea level (MSL), low annual precipitation (45-250 mm), and higher diurnal range of temperature (10-19 degrees C; peak 16 degrees C) as compatible with the biological requirements of the insect vectors. Socio-economic analyses demonstrated the importance of improved housing materials and water source. Home adobe wall materials and having to fetch drinking water from rivers or wells without pump were found to be highly related to distribution of the disease by the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) (0.69 AUC, 0.67 AUC and 0.62 AUC, respectively), while areas with hardwood floors demonstrated a direct negative relationship (-0.71 AUC). This study demonstrates that Maxent modelling can be used in disease prevalence and incidence studies to provide governmental agencies with an easily learned, understandable method to define areas as either high, moderate or low risk for the disease. This information may be used in resource planning, targeting and implementation. However, access to high-resolution, sub-municipality socio-economic data (e. g. census tracts) would facilitate elucidation of the relative influence of poverty-related factors on regional disease dynamics.

AB  - Background-Electrocardiography has been considered an important tool in the management of Chagas disease (ChD) patients, although its value in elderly infected patients is unknown. This study was designed to investigate the prevalence and prognostic value of electrocardiographic abnormalities in Trypanosoma cruzi infected and noninfected older adults.
   Methods and Results-We studied 1462 participants in Bambui City, Brazil, with electrocardiogram (ECG) records classified by the Minnesota Code. Follow-up time was 10 years; the endpoint was mortality. Adjustment for potential confounding variables included age, gender, conventional risk factors, and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). The mean age was 69 years (60.9% women). The prevalence of ChD was 38.1% (n=557). ECG abnormalities were more frequent in ChD patients (87.6% versus 77.7%, P<0.001). Right bundle branch block (RBBB) with left anterior hemiblock (LAH) was strongly related to ChD (OR: 11.99 [5.60 to 25.69]). During the mean follow-up time of 8.7 years, 556 participants died (253 with ChD), and only 89 were lost to follow-up. ECG variables of independent prognostic value for death in ChD included absence of sinus rhythm, frequent ventricular and supraventricular premature beats, atrial fibrillation, RBBB, old and possible old myocardial infarction, and left ventricular hypertrophy. The presence of any major ECG abnormalities doubled the risk of death in ChD patients (HR: 2.18 [1.35 to 3.53]), but it also increased the risk in non-ChD subjects (HR: 1.50 [1.07 to 2.10]); the risk of death increased with the number of major abnormalities in the same patient.
   Conclusion-ECG abnormalities are more common among elderly Chagas disease patients and strongly predict adverse outcomes.

AB  - Twelve strains of Trypanosoma cruzi isolated from wild reservoirs, triatomines, and chronic chagasic patients in the state of Parana, southern Brazil, and classified as T. cruzi I and II, were used to test the correlation between genetic and biological diversity. The Phagocytic Index (PI) and nitric-oxide (NO) production in vitro were used as biological parameters. The PI of the T. cruzi I and II strains did not differ significantly, nor did the PI of the T. cruzi strains isolated from humans, triatomines, or wild reservoirs. There was a statistical difference in the inhibition of NO production between T. cruzi I and II and between parasites isolated from humans and the strains isolated from triatomines and wild reservoirs, but there was no correlation between genetics and biology when the strains were analyzed independently of the lineages or hosts from which the strains were isolated. There were significant correlations for Randomly Amplified Polymorphic Deoxyribonucleic acid (RAPD) and biological parameters for T. cruzi I and II, and for humans or wild reservoirs when the lineages or hosts were considered individually.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of the present study was to assess the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a method for detecting Trypanosoma cruzi infection in triatomines that had been previously determined by microscopic examination in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Methods: In total, 515 specimens were collected. Material from the digestive tract of each triatomine was analyzed for the presence of T. cruzi by microscopic examination and PCR using the 121/122 primer set. Results: Among the 515 specimens tested, 58 (11.3%) were positive by microscopy and 101 (19.61%) were positive by PCR and there was an association between the results of the techniques (chi(2) = 53.354, p = 0.001). The main species of triatomine identified was T sordida (95.5%) Conclusions: The use of PCR in entomological surveillance may contribute to a better assessment of the occurrence of T. cruzi in triatomine populations.

AB  - Background: 9 million people are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in Latin America, plus more than 300,000 in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and Japan. Approximately 30% of infected individuals develop circulatory or digestive pathology. While in underdeveloped countries transmission is mainly through hematophagous arthropods, transplacental infection prevails in developed ones.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: During infection, T. cruzi calreticulin (TcCRT) translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the area of flagellum emergence. There, TcCRT acts as virulence factor since it binds maternal classical complement component C1q that recognizes human calreticulin (HuCRT) in placenta, with increased parasite infectivity. As measured ex vivo by quantitative PCR in human placenta chorionic villi explants (HPCVE) (the closest available correlate of human congenital T. cruzi infection), C1q mediated up to a 3-5-fold increase in parasite load. Because anti-TcCRT and anti-HuCRT F(ab')(2) antibody fragments are devoid of their Fc-dependent capacity to recruit C1q, they reverted the C1q-mediated increase in parasite load by respectively preventing its interaction with cell-bound CRTs from both parasite and HPCVE origins. The use of competing fluid-phase recombinant HuCRT and F(ab')(2) antibody fragments anti-TcCRT corroborated this. These results are consistent with a high expression of fetal CRT on placental free chorionic villi. Increased C1q-mediated infection is paralleled by placental tissue damage, as evidenced by histopathology, a damage that is ameliorated by anti-TcCRT F(ab')(2) antibody fragments or fluid-phase HuCRT.
   Conclusions/Significance: T. cruzi infection of HPCVE is importantly mediated by human and parasite CRTs and C1q. Most likely, C1q bridges CRT on the parasite surface with its receptor orthologue on human placental cells, thus facilitating the first encounter between the parasite and the fetal derived placental tissue. The results presented here have several potential translational medicine aspects, specifically related with the capacity of antibody fragments to inhibit the C1q/CRT interactions and thus T. cruzi infectivity.

AB  - Spliced leader intergenic region (SL-IR) sequences from 23 Trypanosoma rangeli strains isolated from the salivary glands of Rhodnius colombiensis, R. ecuadoriensis, R. pallescens and R. prolixus and two human strains revealed the existence of 4 genotypes with CA, GT, TA, ATT and GTAT microsatellite repeats and the presence of insertions/deletions (INDEL) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) characterizing each genotype. The strains isolated from the same vector species or the same Rhodnius evolutionary line presented the same genotypes, even in cases where strains had been isolated from vectors captured in geographically distant regions. The dendrogram constructed from the SL-IR sequences separated all of them into two main groups, one with the genotypes isolated from R. prolixus and the other group containing three well defined sub-groups with the genotypes isolated from R. pallescens, R. colombiensis and R. ecuadoriensis. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis showed the same two main groups and sub-groups supporting strict T. rangeli genotypes' association with Rhodnius species. Combined with other studies, these results suggest a possible co-evolutionary association between T. rangeli genotypes and their vectors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB  - Background: Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) caused by species from the Leishmania donovani complex is the most severe form of the disease, lethal if untreated. VL caused by Leishmania infantum is a zoonosis with an increasing number of human cases and millions of dogs infected in the Old and the New World. In this study, L. infantum (syn. L. chagasi) strains were isolated from human and canine VL cases. The strains were obtained from endemic areas from Brazil and Portugal and their genetic polymorphism was ascertained using the LSSP-PCR (Low-Stringency Single Specific Primer PCR) technique for analyzing the kinetoplastid DNA (kDNA) minicircles hypervariable region.
   Principal Findings: KDNA genetic signatures obtained by minicircle LSSP-PCR analysis of forty L. infantum strains allowed the grouping of strains in several clades. Furthermore, LSSP-PCR profiles of L. infantum subpopulations were closely related to the host origin (human or canine). To our knowledge this is the first study which used this technique to compare genetic polymorphisms among strains of L. infantum originated from both the Old and the New World.
   Conclusions: LSSP-PCR profiles obtained by analysis of L. infantum kDNA hypervariable region of parasites isolated from human cases and infected dogs from Brazil and Portugal exhibited a genetic correlation among isolates originated from the same reservoir, human or canine. However, no association has been detected among the kDNA signatures and the geographical origin of L. infantum strains.

AB  - Introduction: The vector competence of triatomine insects is determined by studying their biology and feeding behavior under field and/or laboratory conditions. Factors including the number of bites, the amount of blood ingested and defecation time have implications for trypanosome transmission. The biological and behavioral parameters of Rhodnius neglectus and R. robustus were compared under experimental conditions to estimate differences in the potential transmission of trypanosomes. Methods: The insects were observed daily to determine the period of nymphal development, mortality, detection of food source, number of bites, time of blood meal intake, amount of blood ingested, time elapsed between the end of the meal and the first defecation and the frequency of defecation. Results: Although the nymphal development of R. neglectus (156.4 +/- 25.05d) was lower than that of R. robustus (204.7 +/- 13.22d), the mortality between species was similar (63.8 and 65% respectively). R. robustus and R. neglectus quickly located the food source, especially in the first instar (2.5 and 1.6 min, respectively). Although the time of blood meal intake was similar between the species, R. robustus ingested a larger amount of blood on average at all stages and exhibited higher values for the fifth instar. Nymphs of R. neglectus bit more frequently, and they defecated faster and more often than those of R. robustus. Conclusions: Under laboratory conditions, R. neglectus has a greater potential for transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi and T. rangeli than does R. robustus, an attribute that should be further evaluated in experimental infections.

AB  - The aim of this study was to detect cross infections by Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma spp. using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thus, 408 blood samples were collected from dogs domiciled in Ara double dagger atuba Municipality, So Paulo State, Brazil; the dogs were of both sexes, of several breeds and aged 6 months. For Leishmania spp., 14.95 % (61 out of 408) of dogs were reactive using IFAT. Positivity was 20.10 % (82 out of 408) using ELISA and 29.66 % (121 out of 408) using PCR, with significant differences for the sex and age of these animals (p < 0.05). For Trypanosoma spp., antibody occurrence using ELISA was 10.54 % (43 out of 408), while PCR indicated 2.45 % (10 out of 408) positive dogs. Using IFAT, 10.29 % (42 out of 408) of animals were considered positive and only sex showed a significant difference (p < 0.05). In this study, 10.54 % (43 out of 408) of animals were seropositive according to ELISA for Trypanosoma spp., of which 79.07 % (34 out of 43) showed positive results in the molecular diagnosis for Leishmania spp., while of the 10.29 % (42 out of 408) positive dogs according to IFAT, 95.24 % (40 out of 42) had confirmed infection by this parasite. The obtained results demonstrate evidence of cross infections by both protozoa in the animals analysed in this study.

AB  - Some Trypanosoma and Leishmania species are multi-host parasites whose distribution overlaps in several parts of the Brazilian Amazon basin. Despite being a common trait among wild mammals, mixed infections and their consequences for the host's health and parasite transmission are still a poorly known phenomenon. Here we describe a triple mixed infection - Trypanosoma cruzi, T. rangeli and Leishmania infantum - in a bone marrow sample from an anteater Tamandua tetradactyla captured in a house backyard from the endemic Abaetetuba municipality in the Amazon basin. T. cruzi was also isolated from blood samples. The mini-exon multiplex PCR characterization detected the infection by T. rangeli and T. cruzi (TcI genotype), while L. infantum infection was confirmed by an ITS-PCR followed by amplicon sequencing. This is the first description of T. rangeli isolation from bone marrow and the first report of L. infantum infection in xenarthrans. The implications of this finding are discussed considering the influence of mixed infections in the role of this mammal species as a putative reservoir host of these 3 trypanosomatid species.

AB  - This study analyzed the body and the operculum of eggs of Triatoma rubrovaria, T. carcavalloi and T. circummaculata, considered sylvatic species that live in sympatry. Triatoma rubrovaria is currently considered the most important vector of Trypanosoma cruzi in the rural areas of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, followed by T. circummaculata. Significant differences other than morphometry have been observed in the egg structures of the three species using traditional microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Triatoma circummaculata eggs are smaller than those of T. rubrovaria and T. carcavalloi. The average number of perforations in corionic cells in the egg body is higher for the T. rubrovaria. The average number of perforations in the operculum cell is higher in T. circummaculata. This is the first morpho-structural description of T. carcavalloi eggs. These results widen the concept of these three species and create new subsidies for the entomological monitoring in areas in which these vectors may infest human living quarters.

Eighteen cloned stocks were isolated from 115 bats belonging to Carollia perspicillata (Phyllostomidae) from three Amazonian areas of the Chapare Province of Bolivia and studied by xenodiagnosis using the vectors Rhodnius robustus and Triatoma infestans (Trypanosoma cruzi marenkellei) or haemoculture (Trypanosoma dionisii). The PCR DNA amplified was analyzed by nucleotide sequences of maxicircles encoding cytochrome b and by means of the molecular size of hyper variable regions of minicircles. Ten samples were classified as Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei and 8 samples as Trypanosoma dionisii. The two species have a different molecular size profile with respect to the amplified regions of minicircles and also with respect to Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma rangeli used for comparative purpose. We conclude the presence of two species of bat trypanosomes in these samples, which can clearly be identified by the methods used in this study. The presence of these trypanosomes in Amazonian bats is discussed.

AB  - The genetic diversity and phylogeographical patterns of Trypanosoma species that infect Brazilian bats were evaluated by examining 1043 bats from 63 species of seven families captured in Amazonia, the Pantanal, Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest biomes of Brazil. The prevalence of trypanosonne-infected bats, as estimated by haemoculture, was 12.9%, resulting in 77 Cultures of isolates, most morphologically identified as Trypanosoma cf. cruzi, classified by barcoding using partial sequences from ssrRNA gene into the subgenus Schizotrypanum and identified as T. cruzi (15), T cruzi marinkellei (37) or T. cf. dionisii (25). Phylogenetic analyses using nuclear ssrRNA, glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) and mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene sequences generated three clades, which clustered together forming the subgenus Schizotrypanum. In addition to vector association, bat trypanosomes were related by the evolutionary history, ecology and phylogeography of the bats. Tryponosoma cf. dionisii trypanosomes (32.4%) infected 12 species from four bat families captured in all biomes, from North to South Brazil, and clustered with T. dionisii from Europe despite being separated by some genetic distance. Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei (49.3%) was restricted to phyllostomid bats from Amazonia to the Pantanal (North to Central). Trypanosoma cruzi (18.2%) was found mainly in vespertilionid and phyllostomid bats from the Pantanal/Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest (Central to Southeast), with a few isolates from Amazonia.

AB  - Background: Blood donor screening leads to large numbers of new diagnoses of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, with most donors in the asymptomatic chronic indeterminate form. Information on electrocardiogram (ECG) findings in infected blood donors is lacking and may help in counseling and recognizing those with more severe disease. Objectives: To assess the frequency of ECG abnormalities in T. cruzi seropositive relative to seronegative blood donors, and to recognize ECG abnormalities associated with left ventricular dysfunction.
   Methods: The study retrospectively enrolled 499 seropositive blood donors in Sao Paulo and Montes Claros, Brazil, and 483 seronegative control donors matched by site, gender, age, and year of blood donation. All subjects underwent a health clinical evaluation, ECG, and echocardiogram (Echo). ECG and Echo were reviewed blindly by centralized reading centers. Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction was defined as LV ejection fraction (EF), 0.50%.
   Results: Right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block, isolated or in association, were more frequently found in seropositive cases (p<0.0001). Both QRS and QTc duration were associated with LVEF values (correlation coefficients -0.159, p<0.0003, and -0.142, p = 0.002) and showed a moderate accuracy in the detection of reduced LVEF (area under the ROC curve: 0.778 and 0.790, both p<0.0001). Several ECG abnormalities were more commonly found in seropositive donors with depressed LVEF, including rhythm disorders (frequent supraventricular ectopic beats, atrial fibrillation or flutter and pacemaker), intraventricular blocks (right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block) and ischemic abnormalities (possible old myocardial infarction and major and minor ST abnormalities). ECG was sensitive (92%) for recognition of seropositive donors with depressed LVEF and had a high negative predictive value (99%) for ruling out LV dysfunction.
   Conclusions: ECG abnormalities are more frequent in seropositive than in seronegative blood donors. Several ECG abnormalities may help the recognition of seropositive cases with reduced LVEF who warrant careful follow-up and treatment.

AB  - Trypanosoma and Leishmania infections affect wild and domestic animals and human populations. The growing process of deforestation and urbanization of Atlantic Rainforest areas has given rise to introduction of humans and domestic animals to the sylvatic cycles of Trypanosoma and Leishmania species. Serological, parasitological, and molecular surveys among wild and domestic animals in the Corrego do Veado Biological Reserve, which is an Atlantic Rainforest fragment in the state of Esporito Santo, southeastern Brazil, were evaluated. In total, 154 wild animals of 25 species and 67 domestic animals (47 dogs and 20 horses) were sampled. All the domestic animals were serologically negative for anti-Leishmania infantum chagasi antibodies and negative in parasitological approaches. Only the Order Chiroptera presented positive blood cultures and cryopreserved isolates. The phylogenetic trees based on SSU rDNA and gGAPDH genes confirmed the occurrence of Trypanosoma dionisii and provided the first record of Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei in southeastern Brazil. The studies conducted in Atlantic Rainforest remaining trees provide the knowledge of parasite diversity or detect parasites that can accelerate the loss of hosts diversity.

AB  - Caveolae are motile, membrane-bound compartments that contain a number of molecules that participate in cell signaling. Caveolins are protein markers of caveolae and function in a variety of biological processes. Caveolin-3 (Cav-3) is expressed in muscle cells and Cav-3 null mice display a cardiomyopathic phenotype. Ultrastructural cytochemistry, confocal microscopy and immunoblotting revealed a reduction in Cav-3 expression and an activation of ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) 48 hours after Trypanosoma cruzi infection of cultured cardiac myocytes. CD-1 mice infected with the Brazil strain of T. cruzi displayed reduced expression of Cav-3 and activation of ERK 66 days post infection (dpi). By 180 dpi there was a normalization of these values. These data suggest that the reduction in Cav-3 expression and the activation of ERK during the early phase of infection may contribute to the pathogenesis of chagasic cardiomyopathy.

AB  - Objective To describe patterns of spatial distribution of mortality associated with Chagas disease in Brazil. Methods Nationwide study of all deaths in Brazil from 1999 to 2007, where Chagas disease was recorded as a cause of death. Data were obtained from the national Mortality Information System of the Ministry of Health. We calculated the mean mortality rate for each municipality of residence in three-year intervals and the entire period. Empirical Bayes smoothing was used to minimise random variation in mortality rates because of the population size in the municipalities. To evaluate the existence of spatial autocorrelation, global and local Morans I indices were used. Results The nationwide mean mortality rate associated with Chagas disease was 3.37/100 000 inhabitants/year, with a maximum of 138.06/100 000 in one municipality. Independently from the statistical approach, spatial analysis identified a large cluster of high risk for mortality by Chagas disease, involving nine states in the Central region of Brazil. Conclusion This study defined geographical priority areas for the management of Chagas disease and consequently reducing disease-associated mortality in Brazil. Different spatial-analytical approaches can be integrated to provide data for planning, monitoring and evaluating specific intervention measures.

AB  - Background: Understanding the mechanisms that influence the population dynamics and spatial genetic structure of the vectors of pathogens infecting humans is a central issue in tropical epidemiology. In view of the rapid changes in the features of landscape pathogen vectors live in, this issue requires new methods that consider both natural and human systems and their interactions. In this context, individual-based model (IBM) simulations represent powerful yet poorly developed approaches to explore the response of pathogen vectors in heterogeneous social-ecological systems, especially when field experiments cannot be performed.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We first present guidelines for the use of a spatially explicit IBM, to simulate population genetics of pathogen vectors in changing landscapes. We then applied our model with Triatoma brasiliensis, originally restricted to sylvatic habitats and now found in peridomestic and domestic habitats, posing as the most important Trypanosoma cruzi vector in Northeastern Brazil. We focused on the effects of vector migration rate, maximum dispersal distance and attraction by domestic habitat on T. brasiliensis population dynamics and spatial genetic structure. Optimized for T. brasiliensis using field data pairwise fixation index (FST) from microsatellite loci, our simulations confirmed the importance of these three variables to understand vector genetic structure at the landscape level. We then ran prospective scenarios accounting for land-use change (deforestation and urbanization), which revealed that human-induced land-use change favored higher genetic diversity among sampling points.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our work shows that mechanistic models may be useful tools to link observed patterns with processes involved in the population genetics of tropical pathogen vectors in heterogeneous social-ecological landscapes. Our hope is that our study may provide a testable and applicable modeling framework to a broad community of epidemiologists for formulating scenarios of landscape change consequences on vector dynamics, with potential implications for their surveillance and control.

AB  - This article describes the first use of heat-killed, borate-buffered preparations of aerobic actinomycetales to immunize pregnant animals in order to determine the effect on their pregnancy and fertility and the survival coefficients of their offspring. Pregnant rats received three injections of Gordonia bronchialis, Rhodococcus coprophylus or physiological saline and a proportion of their offspring were challenged with live Trypanosoma cruzi at the time of weaning. Levels of parasitemia and, in some animals, of the cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-10 were measured. The progress of pregnancy, fertility and survival of offspring were unaffected by the maternal immunizations. The offspring of rats immunized with G. bronchialis displayed significantly reduced parasitemias, with increased levels of IFN-gamma and reduced levels of IL-10, 4 days after challenge. The offspring of rats immunized with R. coprophylus displayed greater parasitemias than did those of the control group. These unexpected results are discussed and their causation considered.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas' disease is a major public health problem in Brazil and needs extensive and reliable information to support consistent prevention and control actions. This study describes the most common causes of death associated with deaths related to Chagas' disease (underlying or associated cause of death). Methods: Mortality data were obtained from the Mortality Information System of the Ministry of Health (approximately 9 million deaths). We analyzed all deaths that occurred in Brazil between 1999 and 2007, where Chagas' disease was mentioned on the death certificate as underlying or associated cause (multiple causes of death). Results: There was a total of 53,930 deaths related to Chagas' disease, 44,543 (82.6%) as underlying cause and 9,387 (17.4%) as associated cause. The main diseases and conditions associated with death by Chagas' disease as underlying cause included direct complications of cardiac involvement, such as conduction disorders/arrhythmias (41.4%) and heart failure (37.7%). Cerebrovascular disease (13.2%), ischemic heart disease (13.2%) and hypertensive diseases (9.3%) were the main underlying causes of deaths in which Chagas' disease was identified as an associated cause. Conclusions: Cardiovascular diseases were often associated with deaths related to Chagas' disease. Information from multiple causes of death recorded on death certificates allows reconstruction of the natural history of Chagas' disease and suggests preventive and therapeutic potential measures more adequate and specifics.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the feeding behavior of Triatoma vitticeps through the identification of its food sources and the characterization of the blood ingestion process. In addition, we aimed to verify if the saliva of this vector interferes with the perception of the host during the feedings by creating a nervous impulse. Here, we demonstrated that the T. vitticeps saliva reduces, gradually and irreversibly, the amplitude of the compound action potential of the nervous fibre, which helps decrease the perception of the insect by the host. The precipitin reaction demonstrated the feeding eclecticism of this vector, with the identification of eight food sources - most of them found simultaneously in the same insect. The analysis of the electrical signals produced by the cibarial pump during meals demonstrated that the best feeding performance of T. vitticeps nymphs that fed on pigeons is mainly due to the higher contraction frequency of the pump. The longer contact period with the host to obtain a complete meal compared with other triatominae species of the same instar could favor the occurrence of multiple blood sources in T. vitticeps under natural conditions, as it was evidenced by the precipitin test.

AB  - In the order Chiroptera, more than 30 trypanosome species belonging to the subgenera Herpetosoma, Schizotrypanum, Megatrypanum, and Trypanozoon have been described. The species Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei, and Trypanosoma dionisii are the most common in bats and belong to the Schizotrypanum subgenus. Bats from 2 different biomes, Pantanal and Amazonia/Cerrado in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, were evaluated according to the presence of trypanosome parasites by means of hemoculture and PCR in primary samples (blood samples). A total of 211 bats from 20 different species were caught and the trypanosome prevalence, evaluated through hemoculture, was 9.0% (19), 15.5% (13), and 4.8% (6) in the municipalities of Confresa (Amazonia/Cerrado biome) and Pocone (Pantanal biome). Among the 123 primary samples obtained from the bats, only 3 (2.4%) were positive. Phylogenetic analysis using trypanosomatid barcoding (V7V8 region of SSU rDNA) identified all the isolates and primary samples as T. c. marinkellei. The sequences of the isolates were segregated according to the bat host genus or species and suggest that co-evolutionary patterns exist between hosts and parasites. Further studies in different Brazilian regions and biomes need to be conducted in order to gain real understanding of the diversity of trypanosomes in bats.

The goal of this study was to determine T. infestans foci in the City of Ibipeba, State of Bahia. Methods: Triatominae specimens were collected in Ibipeba and entomologic indicators were calculated using indices of domiciliary infestation, density, and colonization. Results: T. infestans foci was discovery in Ibipeba, State of Bahia. Approximately 95% of the specimens were discovered inside dwellings, of which 34% were T. infestans. This species was also discovered forming a colony in tree bark in the peridomicile. Conclusions: Triatoma infestans foci in peridomestic ecotopes in Ibipeba, BA, indicate increased the risk of transmission Chagas disease.

AB  - This work aims to compare the effects of acute or chronic infections with the T. cruzi genotypes TcI (X10 strain), TcII (Y strain) and TcVI (Tulahuen strain) on fertility, gestation, pup growth and the possible vertical transmission of parasites in BALB/c mice. The occurrence of congenital infection was evaluated by microscopic examination of blood and/or qPCR on blood and heart in newborn pups and/or older offspring submitted to cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression in order to detect possible cryptic congenital infection. Altogether, the results show that: i) for the three strains tested, acute infection occurring after the embryo implantation in the uterus (parasite inoculation 4 days before mating), or close to delivery (parasite inoculation on day 13 of gestation), prevents or severely jeopardizes gestation outcome (inducing pup mortality and intra-uterine growth retardation); ii) for the three strains tested, gestation during chronic infection results in intra-uterine growth retardation, whereas re-inoculation of TcVI parasites during gestation in such chronically infected mice, in addition, strongly increases pup mortality; iii) congenital infection remains a rare consequence of infection (occurring in approximately 4% of living pups born to acutely infected dams); iv) PCR, detecting parasitic DNA and not living parasites, is not convenient to detect congenial infection close to delivery; v) transmission of parasites by breast milk is unlikely. This study should encourage further investigations using other parasite strains and genotypes to explore the role of virulence and other factors, as well as the mechanisms of such effects on gestation and on the establishment of congenital infection.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is an infection caused by the protozoan flagellate Trypanosoma cruzi, and transmitted by insects of the genera Triatoma, Rhodnius and Panstrongylus. The heart is affected to varying degrees by inflammatory and destructive lesions in atrial and ventricular myocardial fibers. Several studies have demonstrated the benefits of exercise in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), including reduced sympathetic tone and increased parasympathetic tone, the result of reduced epinephrine and norepinephrine levels, both at rest and during exercise, including at submaximal levels. It has been hypothesized that the increase in sympathetic arousal during exercise improves peripheral muscle metabolism.
   Objectives: The objectives of this study were to select patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) with dysautonomia on 24-h Hotter monitoring, assess autonomic function after rehabilitation, and determine whether it resulted in reduced daytime levels of SDNN and increased daytime and nighttime levels of pNN50 and rMSSD.
   Methods: We analyzed time-domain indices of heart rate variability through 24-h Hotter monitoring before and after a supervised exercise program. We studied 18 CCC patients (five men), mean age 57.33 +/- 9.73 years, followed at the CD outpatient clinic of the National Institute of Cardiology and IPEC/Fiocruz in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between April 2009 and November 2010. The following tests were used to assess the severity of CCC: clinical examination, functional evaluation by cardiopulmonary stress testing, electrocardiogram and conventional Doppler echocardiography. The exams were performed within a month of the start and end of the exercise program, which consisted of 60-min sessions of aerobic exercise on a treadmill and resistance training three times a week for six months. The goal was to reach the patients' heart rate target zone during training, and their rating of perceived exertion was assessed by the modified Borg scale.
   Results: There were no statistically significant differences (p>0.05) in SDNN, pNN50 and rMSSD, probably due to the large standard deviation observed, patients' poor adherence to the program and their low socioeconomic status, resulting in a small sample, and the short duration of the program.
   Conclusion: Heart rate variability parameters in patients with CCC did not undergo statistically significant changes after a six-month cardiac rehabilitation program. (C) 2011 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: A time series study of admissions, deaths and acute cases was conducted in order to evaluate the context of Chagas disease in Pernambuco. Methods: Data reported to the Information Technology Department of the Brazilian National Health Service between 1980 and 2008 was collected for regions and Federal Units of Brazil; and microregions and municipalities of Pernambuco. Rates (per 100,000 inhabitants) of hospitalization, mortality and acute cases were calculated using a national hospital database (SIH), a national mortality database (SIM) and the national Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN), respectively. Results: The national average for Chagas disease admissions was 0.99 from 1995 to 2008. Pernambuco obtained a mean of 0.39 in the same period, with the highest rates being concentrated in the interior of the state. The state obtained a mean mortality rate of 1.56 between 1980 and 2007, which was lower than the national average (3.66). The mortality rate has tended to decline nationally, while it has remained relatively unchanged in Pernambuco. Interpolating national rates of admissions and deaths, mortality rates were higher than hospitalization rates between 1995 and 2007. The same occurred in Pernambuco, except for 2003. Between 2001 and 2006, rates for acute cases were 0.56 and 0.21 for Brazil and Pernambuco, respectively. Conclusions: Although a decrease in Chagas mortality has occurred in Brazil, the disease remains a serious public health problem, especially in the northeast region. It is thus essential that medical care, prevention and control regarding Chagas disease be maintained and improved.

AB  - Zinc is an essential micronutrient and has significant effects on human growth, development, and immune function. Zinc supplementation or deficiency may affect the course of infection. Zinc enhances immune response against a wide range of viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens. In the present study, we investigated the effects of zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) supplementation (20 mg/kg/day) during pregnancy in mice, Swiss Webster strain infected by the Y strain of Trypanosoma cruzi. Oral supplementation of zinc sulphate in pregnant and non-pregnant infected animals did not affect the count of blood parasites as well as tissue parasitism in the heart, liver, and spleen. Zinc supplementation did not alter female body weight, the length of fetuses and neonates, placental size/weight and mortality rate. Among zinc supplied animals, no significant plasmatic zinc concentrations were observed. Concerning to tissue zinc concentrations, only the liver displayed enhanced values as compared to other organs. For placental parasitism, zinc supplied group displayed a significant decrease in amastigote burdens (P < 0.05). However due to the reduced number of parasite burdens in placenta of animals supplied with zinc, these data suggest that zinc was partially effective in up-regulating the host's immune response against parasite, probably attenuating the infection in fetuses.

AB  - This article analyses the construction of national pathologies in Brazil and Argentina between the first and the fourth decades of the 20th century. The scientific, social and political debate concerning Chagas disease and goiter are considered, as well as the relationships between this debate and the collective production of Brazilian and Argentinean nationalities. In this sense, the "discovery" of diseases of the Brazilian hinterland led to implementation of a health project with nationwide projection, whereas in Argentina this situation was met with a more moderate approach. This was because the main concern was related to diseases considered a product of civilisation and attributed to the immigration of foreigners.

AB  - Neglected parasitic infections, including Chagas disease, toxocariasis, cysticercosis, and toxoplasmosis, affect millions of persons in the United States. Relatively few resources have been devoted to surveillance, prevention, and treatment of these diseases. Chagas disease primarily affects Latin American immigrants and can cause heart failure and death if not treated. Immediate antiparasitic treatment is indicated for most patients with acute Chagas disease. Treatment is recommended for patients younger than 18 years who have chronic Chagas disease and is generally recommended for adults younger than 50 years who do not have advanced cardiomyopathy; treatment decisions for other patients should be made on an individual basis. Toxocariasis primarily affects children and can cause gastrointestinal, respiratory, and ophthalmologic disease. Treatment options include albendazole and mebendazole. Patients with ocular infection require referral to an ophthalmologist. Neurocysticercosis, a form of cysticercosis, is the most common infectious cause of seizures in some parts of the United States. Initial treatment should focus on symptom control. Humans generally acquire toxoplasmosis by eating undercooked contaminated meat or ingesting things that have been contaminated with cat feces. Congenital infection can result in miscarriage or adverse fetal effects. Treatment is recommended for immunosuppressed persons, pregnant women, and immunocompetent persons with severe symptoms.

AB  - The use of geo-spatial analysis to anticipate transmission risk for Chagas disease was tested in a rural area of northeast Brazil in an approach that combined geo-referencing and exploratory study of triatomine infestation, including related elements such as the environment and hosts. A total of 617 triatomine specimens, mainly Triatoma brasiliensis, were captured, exhibiting an overall T. cruzi positivity of 44.4%. Layer analysis indicated that the greatest transmission risk to man was associated with woodpiles. The buffer area generated contained uninhabited dwellings teeming with bats and positive bugs. Other locations outside the buffer, near uninhabited dwellings housing cattle, contained colonies of triatomines harboring T. cruzi. The results indicate that local residents' activities themselves favor the development of risk areas for Chagas disease. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The successful elimination of vectorial and transfusional transmission of Chagas' disease from some countries is a result of the reduction of domestic density of the primary vector Triatoma infestans, of almost 100% of coverage in blood serological selection and to the fact that the basic reproductive number of Chagas' disease is very close to one (1.25). Therefore, congenital transmission is currently the only way of acquiring Chagas' Disease in such regions. In this paper we propose a model of congenital transmission of Chagas' disease. Its aim is to provide an estimation of the time period it will take to eliminate this form of transmission in regions where vetorial transmission was reduced to close to zero, like in Brazil.

AB  - The triatomine bug Triatoma infestans was probably originated in Bolivia and dispersed passively over large areas of South America, where it is the major vector of Trypanosoma cruzi. In its probable origin area this species shows two different patterns of behaviour, being found both in sylvatic and human related habitats. Such behaviour is not observed in other areas of its distribution, where it is exclusive to human related habitats. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate head morphometry characters and isoenzymes patterns of two T. infestans populations, one collected in Minas Gerais (Brazil) and other in the Cochabamba Valley (Bolivia), in order to elucidate the factors that could have an implication with the different colonization behaviour. The two populations presented differences in both morphometric (head size) and isoenzymes (specially PGM enzyme profile). The insects from the colonies reared for several years in laboratory conditions, showed reduction in head size starting from the third generation, maintaining this same size in all generations after, until 10 years after generation. The laboratory rearing conditions could be similar to human associated habitats, inducing certain level of genetic homogeneity. Our results showed increase of genetic homogeneity in Brazilian and laboratory-reared colonies from Bolivia, that may be due to a selection process due to passive dispersion, followed by several founder effects episodes and genetic drift.

AB  - Gold standard serological diagnostic methods focus on antigens that elicit a strong humoral immune response that is specific to a certain pathogen. In this study, we used bioinformatics approaches to identify linear B-cell epitopes that are conserved among Leishmania species but are divergent from the host species Homo sapiens and Canis familiaris and from Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, to select potential targets for the immunodiagnosis of leishmaniasis. Using these criteria, we selected heat shock protein 83.1 of Leishmania braziliensis for this study. We predicted three linear B-cell epitopes in its sequence. These peptides and the recombinant heat shock protein 83.1 (rHSP83.1) were tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) against serum samples from patients with tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and from dogs infected with Leishmania infantum (canine VL [CVL]). Our data show that rHSP83.1 is a promising target in the diagnosis of TL. We also identified specific epitopes derived from HSP83.1 that can be used in the diagnosis of human TL (peptide 3), both human and canine VL (peptides 1 and 3), and all TL, VL, and CVL clinical manifestations (peptide 3). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed the superior performance of rHSP83.1 and peptides 1 and 3 compared to that of the soluble L. braziliensis antigen and the reference test kit for the diagnosis of CVL in Brazil (EIE-LVC kit; Bio-Manguinhos, Fiocruz). Our study thus provides proof-of-principle evidence of the feasibility of using bioinformatics to identify novel targets for the immunodiagnosis of parasitic diseases using proteins that are highly conserved throughout evolution.

AB  - Investigation of the bioactive crude extracts from the leaves of Erythrina speciosa Andr. (Leguminosae-Papilionoideae) from Brazil led to the isolation of nororientaline as a new alkaloid in this plant. The activity of crude extract and alkaloids, isolated from leaves of E. speciosa were evaluated;against Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes and trypomastigotes in vitro. Our results show that crude alcoholic extract of E. speciosa (Et-Es) and alkaloids containing nororientaline at 250 mu g/mL, 500 mu g/mL and 1000 mu g/mL inhibited 50, 60 and 80 % of epimastigote growth, respectively (p < 0.001). Et-Es showed activity against trypomastigote forms in 80 % and 60 % at 1000 mu g/mL and 500 mu g/mL, respectively. When tested against macrophages, the same extract did not affect the cell viability as measured by luminescent assay, suggesting that it should be considered as a leading structure for further research.

TI  - Chagas disease in Switzerland: history and challenges
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
LA  - English
KW  - TRANSMISSION
AB  - Chagas disease, endemic in Latin America, is an emerging health problem in Europe affecting an estimated 80,000 persons. Around 60,000 Latin American migrants live in Switzerland, and cases of Chagas disease have been reported since 1979. As of June 2011, 258 cases have been diagnosed, mostly adults in the indeterminate phase of the chronic stage of the disease. Vertical transmission has been identified and there is a high potential for blood-and organ-borne transmission in the absence of systematic screening. Major challenges include (i) raising awareness among migrants and healthcare professionals, (ii) developing national protocols for screening and treatment targeting high-risk groups such as pregnant woman, newborns, migrants from highly endemic areas (e. g. Bolivia), and immunocompromised migrants, (iii) preventing blood-and organ-borne transmission by appropriate screening strategies, (iv) taking into account the social vulnerability of individuals at risk in the design and implementation of public health programmes, and (v) facilitating contacts with the communities at risk through outreach programmes, for example in churches and cultural groups

AB  - Different approaches to environmental-health research can use a variety of conceptual models. This paper presents, refines and illustrates the hypothesis that different conceptual models are linked to a range of contrasted ethical postures. Qualitative observation of an international and interdisciplinary research project about the interactions between mercury contamination in rivers, Chagas disease, and the agricultural practices of small-scale farming populations in the tropical Amazon basin of Brazil made this case study possible. The ethical debate about how to inform subjects about their Chagas disease serology results is recounted and set in the context of a distinction between "ecohealth'' (or an ecosystemic approach to health) and "ecoepidemiological'' approaches. Contrasting these models and underlying the consequences of their overlap, the author underlines the ethical and epistemological importance of critical distance in planning and analysing research strategies.

AB  - The domestic dog's involvement with different members of the Trypanosomatidae family has been the focus of several studies due to this animal's close proximity to man. Recently this animal has been infected by a new Trypanosoma species (T. caninum), described in Rio de Janeiro and 19 similar isolates were later obtained. The objective of this study was to identify these isolates. All samples were isolated from intact skin cultures and analysed morphologically, by biochemical isoenzyme electrophoresis assays and by several molecular PCR assays. Additionally, anti-Leishmania sp. antibodies were assessed using the indirect Immunofluorescence Antibody Test (IFAT) in all animals. The methodologies employed to identify the isolates, including partial nucleotide sequences of 18S rRNA gene, indicated patterns identical to T. caninum and patterns different from the other species, including T. cruzi and T. rangeli samples. A phylogenetic tree constructed with the partial 18S ribosomal sequence shows that T. caninum is clustered with T. pestanai. Ten (52.6%) animals presented anti-Leishmania sp. antibodies with titres varying from 1 : 40 to 1 : 320. Thus, the hypothesis that this protozoan has disseminated among the dogs in Rio de Janeiro must be considered. The importance of a correct diagnosis in those animals and the possible consequences in the areas where visceral leishmaniasis is found are discussed here.

AB  - Background: Chagas' disease is an important neglected public health problem in many Latin American countries, but population-based epidemiological data are scarce. Here we present a nationwide analysis on Chagas-associated mortality, and risk factors for death from this disease.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed all death certificates of individuals who died between 1999 and 2007 in Brazil, based on the nationwide Mortality Information System (a total of 243 data sets with about 9 million entries). Chagas' disease was mentioned in 53,930 (0.6%) of death certificates, with 44,537 (82.6%) as an underlying cause and 9,387 (17.4%) as an associated cause of death. Acute Chagas' disease was responsible for 2.8% of deaths. The mean standardized mortality rate was 3.36/100.000 inhabitants/year. Nationwide standardized mortality rates reduced gradually, from 3.78 (1999) to 2.78 (2007) deaths/year per 100,000 inhabitants (-26.4%). Standardized mortality rates were highest in the Central-West region, ranging from 15.23 in 1999 to 9.46 in 2007 (-37.9%), with a significant negative linear trend (p = 0.001; R-2 = 82%). Proportional mortality considering multiple causes of death was 0.60%. The Central-West showed highest proportional mortality among regions (2.17%), with a significant linear negative trend, from 2.28% to 1.90% (-19.5%; p = 0.001; R-2 = 84%). There was a significant increase in the Northeast of 38.5% (p = 0.006; R-2 = 82%). Bivariable analysis on risk factors for death from Chagas' disease showed highest relative risks (RR) in older age groups (RR: 10.03; 95% CI: 9.40-10.70; p<0.001) and those residing in the Central-West region (RR: 15.01; 95% CI: 3.90-16.22; p<0.001). In logistic regression analysis, age >= 30 years (adjusted OR: 10.81; 95% CI: 10.03-10.65; p<0.001) and residence in one of the three high risk states Minas Gerais, Goias or the Federal District (adjusted OR: 5.12; 95% CI: 5.03-5.22, p<0.001) maintained important independent risk factors for death by Chagas' disease.
   Conclusions/Significance: This is the first nationwide population-based study on Chagas mortality in Brazil, considering multiple causes of death. Despite the decline of mortality associated with Chagas' disease in Brazil, the disease remains a serious public health problem with marked regional differences.

AB  - Introduction: Triatoma carcavalloi is a wild species that is found in sympatry with Triatoma rubrovaria and Triatoma circummaculata, which are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi currently found in rural areas of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Methods: Fertility was assessed and to determine the incubation period, the eggs were observed until hatching. The first meal was offered to 1st stage nymphs. The intermolt period was also determined. The number of blood meals was quantified at each nymphal stage and the resistance to fasting as the period between ecdysis and death. Mortality was assessed and longevity was determined by recording the time that elapsed from molting to the adult stage and until death. The developmental cycle was assessed by recording the length in days of each stage from molting to adult hood. Results: The average incubation period was 22.7 days. The average first meal occurred 3.1 days after hatching. The 5th stage nymph to adult intermolting period was the longest at 193.4 days. The average number of feedings during nymphal development was 13.4. The resistance to fasting assay indicated that the 3rd, 4th and 5th stage nymphs presented higher resistance than did adults. The highest mortality rate was observed in the 3rd stage nymphs (22.2%). The average length of adult survival was 25.6 weeks, and the average total life cycle lasted 503.4 days. Conclusions: This study is the first report on the biology of T. carcavalloi that fed on mice. The presented findings expand the bionomic knowledge of these species.

AB  - Species identification through DNA barcoding is a tool to be added to taxonomic procedures, once it has been validated. Applying barcoding techniques in public health would aid in the identification and correct delimitation of the distribution of rodents from the subfamily Sigmodontinae. These rodents are reservoirs of etiological agents of zoonoses including arenaviruses, hantaviruses, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis. In this study we compared distance-based and probabilistic phylogenetic inference methods to evaluate the performance of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) in sigmodontine identification. A total of 130 sequences from 21 field-trapped species (13 genera), mainly from southern Brazil, were generated and analyzed, together with 58 GenBank sequences (24 species; 10 genera). Preliminary analysis revealed a 9.5% rate of misidentifications in the field, mainly of juveniles, which were reclassified after examination of external morphological characters and chromosome numbers. Distance and model-based methods of tree reconstruction retrieved similar topologies and monophyly for most species. Kernel density estimation of the distance distribution showed a clear barcoding gap with overlapping of intraspecific and interspecific densities < 1% and 21 species with mean intraspecific distance < 2%. Five species that are reservoirs of hantaviruses could be identified through DNA barcodes. Additionally, we provide information for the description of a putative new species, as well as the first COI sequence of the recently described genus Drymoreomys. The data also indicated an expansion of the distribution of Calomys tener. We emphasize that DNA barcoding should be used in combination with other taxonomic and systematic procedures in an integrative framework and based on properly identified museum collections, to improve identification procedures, especially in epidemiological surveillance and ecological assessments.

AB  - Infection with Bartonella spp may cause cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis and endocarditis in humans. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a possible association between Bartonella spp bacteremia and endocarditis, arrhythmia and Chagas cardiomyopathy in patients from Brazil and Argentina. We screened for the presence of bacterial 16S rRNA in human blood by PCR using oligonucleotides to amplify a 185-bp bacterial DNA fragment. Blood samples were taken from four groups of subjects in Brazil and Argentina: i) control patients without clinical disease, ii) patients with negative blood-culture endocarditis, iii) patients with arrhythmias, and iv) patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel to visualize the 185-bp fragment and then sequenced to confirm the identity of DNA. Sixty of 148 patients (40.5%) with cardiac disease and 1 of 56 subjects (1.8%) from the control group presented positive PCR amplification for Bartonella spp, suggesting a positive association of the bacteria with these diseases. Separate analysis of the four groups showed that the risk of a Brazilian patient with endocarditis being infected with Bartonella was 22 times higher than in the controls. In arrhythmic patients, the prevalence of infection was 45 times higher when compared to the same controls and 40 times higher for patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the association between Bartonella spp bacteremia and Chagas disease. The present data may be useful for epidemiological and prevention studies in Brazil and Argentina.

AB  - One hundred and twenty-one isolates of endophytic fungi were recovered from leaves of the bioactive Brazilian plant species Ageratum myriadenia, Palicourea tetraphylla, Piptadenia adiantoides, and Trixis vauthieri. All fungal isolates were cultivated in liquid media and crude extracts were obtained with ethyl acetate. The crude extracts were tested in bioassay panels using Leishmania amazonensis, Trypanosoma cruzi, the enzyme trypanothione reductase (TryR) from Trypanosoma cruzi, and three human cancer cell lines. Thirty-three extracts (27.2%) exhibited at least one biological activity. Seventeen extracts (14%) were cytotoxic against one or more human cancer cell line with the IC50 values ranged of >0.2 to 25 mu g/mL. Twenty-four extracts (19.8%) inhibited the activity of TryR, and three showed ability to inhibit the growth of T. cruzi above 60% and their IC50 values ranged among 1 to 10 mu g/mL. Eleven extracts (9%) were able to inhibit the growth of L. amazonensis and showed with IC50 values ranged among 4.6 to 24.4 mu g/mL. The endophytic fungi were identified as belonging to the genera Alternaria, Arthrinium, Cochliobolus, Colletotrichum, Penicillium, Fusarium, and Gibberella. An interesting result was obtained for the bioactive isolates UFMGCB 508, 537, 899 and 903, which were related to fungi associated with medicinal plants native to Asia, Australia, Africa, and Polynesia. These results indicate that bioactive plants living in Brazilian ecosystems are a potential host of endophytic fungi able to produce bioactive prototype molecules for drug development against neglected tropical diseases.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas' disease is not considered an endemic disease in the State of Maranhao. However, entomological surveys showed high natural vector infection indices and acute cases have been identified in the last few decades. This study aimed to analyze the social, demographic and environmental conditions involved in transmission. Methods: The study describes acute Chagas' disease identified from 1994 to 2008. Information regarding the cases was obtained from the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (Sinan), National Health Foundation (Funasa) database and medical records. Entomological surveys were conducted from 2002. Results: Data analysis indentified 32 cases from 17 municipal districts, with 84.4% of patients from rural areas. The disease was more frequent in men (67%). The most frequent occupation was student, 38.9% of cases, followed by farmer and hunter, 27.8%. Conclusions: The study suggests that transmission was vectorial and occurred in the wild or peridomicile.

KW  - Chagas disease
AB  - Carlos Chagas was born on 9 July 1878 in the farm "Bon Retiro" located close to the City of Oliveira in the interior of the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. He started his medical studies in 1897 at the School of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro. In the late XIX century, the works by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch induced a change in the medical paradigm with emphasis in experimental demonstrations of the causal link between microbes and disease. During the same years in Germany appeared the pathological concept of disease, linking organic lesions with symptoms. All these innovations were adopted by the reforms of the medical schools in Brazil and influenced the scientific formation of Chagas.
   Chagas completed his medical studies between 1897 and 1903 and his examinations during these years were always ranked with high grades. Oswaldo Cruz accepted Chagas as a doctoral candidate and directed his thesis on "Hematological studies of Malaria" which was received with honors by the examiners. In 1903 the director appointed Chagas as research assistant at the Institute. In those years, the Institute of Manguinhos, under the direction of Oswald Cruz, initiated a process of institutional growth and gathered a distinguished group of Brazilian and foreign scientists. In 1907, he was requested to investigate and control a malaria outbreak in Lassance, Minas Gerais. In this moment Chagas could not have imagined that this field research was the beginning of one of the most notable medical discoveries. Chagas was, at the age of 28, a Research Assistant at the Institute of Manguinhos and was studying a new flagellate parasite isolated from triatomine insects captured in the State of Minas Gerais. Chagas made his discoveries in this order: first the causal agent, then the vector and finally the human cases. These notable discoveries were carried out by Chagas in twenty months. At the age of 33 Chagas had completed his discoveries and published the scientific articles that gave him world recognition and a deserved high place in medical history. After the publication of his classic article the world paid homage to Chagas who was elected member of the National Academy of Medicine of Brazil on 26 October 1910, and at the age of 31, of other National Academies of the continent. The Committee of Hygiene of the Society of Nations, precursor of the World Health Organization, was created in 1929. Chagas was elected member of this Committee from its inception until 1933. The example of Chagas' life can be summarized in his interest that medical research should be translated into concrete benefits for human beings because he was convinced that disease had not only biological but social determinants as well. Carlos Chagas was a laboratory researcher, a clinician and a health administrator. For all these accomplishments he deserves our respect and admiration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A century after its discovery, Chagas disease (CD) is still considered a public health problem. Mortality caused by CD between 2000 and 2010 was described according to the specific underlying cause, year of occurrence, gender, age range, and region of Brazil. The standardized mortality rate decreased 32.4%, from 3.4% in 2000 to 2.3% in 2010. Most of the deaths (85.9%) occurred in male patients who were > 60 years of age caused by cardiac involvement. The mortality rate caused by cardiac involvement decreased in all regions of Brazil, except in the North region, where it increased by 1.6%. The Northeast had the smallest and the Central-West had the largest decrease. The mortality rate caused by a compromised digestive tract increased in all regions. Despite the control of transmission by vector and blood transfusions, CD should remain on the list of priority diseases for the public health service in Brazil, and surveillance actions cannot be interrupted.

AB  - Representatives of the genus Trypanosoma have been traditionally found in epimastigote, espheromastigote and trypomastigote flagellated forms in axenic cultures. Trypanosoma caninum is a trypanosomatid that has recently been reported infecting dogs in endemic areas of canine leishmaniasis in Brazil. It presents specific biological characteristics and it is found exclusively on healthy skin. Here, we describe the evolutive forms of this parasite showing not only the forms commonly found in culture, but also epimastigote forms with no free flagellum. The study was conducted using scanning and transmission electron microscopy and, we demonstrate that typical flagellated epimastigotes originate from forms without flagellum, although the latter may remain without differentiation in the culture. Two hypotheses are considered and discussed in this paper: (i) the aflagellated epimastigotes are a typical developmental forms of T. caninum and (ii) the emergence of these aflagellated forms could be resultant from a disturbed process during cell division caused by interfering specific proteins, which leads to inability to form and regulate the flagellum length. In any case, considering that T. caninum is a parasite that is still little studied, the information brought by our study adds data which may be useful to clarify aspects on the cell cycle of this intriguing parasite that has been found in different regions of Brazil.

AB  - Background
   Prevention of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) by treating infected populations with trypanocidal therapy (TT) remains a challenge. Despite a renewed enthusiasm for TT, uncertainty regarding its efficacy, concerns about its safety and limited availability remain barriers for a wider use of conventional drugs. We have updated a previous version of this review.
   Objectives
   To systematically search, appraise, identify and extract data from eligible studies comparing the outcome of cohorts of seropositive individuals to Trypanosoma cruzi exposed to TT versus placebo or no treatment.
   Search methods
   We sought eligible studies in electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 1, 2014); MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to January week 5 2014); EMBASE (Ovid, 1980 to 2014 week 6) and LILACS (up to 6 May 2010)) by combining terms related with the disease and the treatment. The search also included a Google search, handsearch for references in review or selected articles, and search of expert files. We applied no language restrictions.
   Selection criteria
   Review authors screened the retrieved references for eligibility (those dealing with human participants treated with TT) and then assessed the pre-selected studies in full for inclusion. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that provided data on either mortality or clinical progression of CCC after at least four years of follow-up.
   Data collection and analysis
   Teams of two review authors independently carried out the study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment, with a referee resolving disagreement within the pairs. Data collection included study design, characteristics of the population and interventions or exposures and outcome measures. We defined categories of outcome data as parasite-related (positive serology, xenodiagnosis or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after TT) and participant-related (including efficacy outcomes such as progression towards CCC, all-cause mortality and side effects of TT). We reported pooled outcome data as Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios (OR) or standardised mean differences (SMD) along with 95% confidence intervals (CI), using a random-effects model. I-2 statistics provided an estimate of heterogeneity across studies. We conducted an exploratory meta-regression analysis of the relationship between positive-serology and progression of CCC or mortality.
   Main results
   We included 13 studies involving 4229 participants (six RCTs, n = 1096, five RCTs of intermediate risk of bias, one RCT of high risk of bias; four non-randomised experiments, n = 1639 and three observational studies, n = 1494). Ten studies tested nitroderivative drugs nifurtimox or benznidazole (three exposed participants to allopurinol, one to itraconazole). Five studies were conducted in Brazil, five in Argentina, one in Bolivia, one in Chile and one in Venezuela.
   TT was associated with substantial, but heterogeneous reductions on parasite-related outcomes such as positive serology (9 studies, OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.44, I-2 = 76%), positive PCR (2 studies, OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.92, I-2 = 0%), positive xenodiagnosis after treatment (6 studies, OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.86, I-2 = 79%), or reduction on antibody titres (3 studies, SMD -0.56, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.23, I-2 = 28%). Efficacy data on patient-related outcomes was largely from non-RCTs. TT with nitroderivatives was associated with potentially important, but imprecise and inconsistent reductions in progression of CCC (4 studies, 106 events, OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.73, I-2 = 66%) and mortality after TT (6 studies, 99 events, OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.14, I-2 = 48%). The overall median incidence of any severe side effects among 1475 individuals from five studies exposed to TT was 2.7%, and the overall discontinuation of this two-month therapy in RCTs (5 studies, 134 events) was 20.5% (versus 4.3% among controls) and 10.4% in other five studies (125 events).

   Despite the evidence that TT reduced parasite-related outcomes, the low quality and inconsistency of the data for patient-important outcomes must be treated with caution. More geographically diverse RCTs testing newer forms of TT are warranted in order to 1. estimate efficacy more precisely, 2. explore factors potentially responsible for the heterogeneity of results and 3. increase knowledge on the efficacy/tolerance balance of conventional TT.

AB  - We estimated the geographic distributions of triatomine species in Central-West Region of Brazil (CW) and analysed the climatic factors influencing their occurrence. A total of 3,396 records of 27 triatomine species were analysed. Using the maximum entropy method, ecological niche models were produced for eight species occurring in at least 20 municipalities based on 13 climatic variables and elevation. Triatoma sordida and Rhodnius neglectus were the species with the broadest geographic distributions in CW Brazil. The Cerrado areas in the state of Goias were found to be more suitable for the occurrence of synanthropic triatomines than the Amazon forest areas in the northern part of the state of Mato Grosso. The variable that best explains the evaluated models is temperature seasonality. The results indicate that almost the entire region presents climatic conditions that are appropriate for at least one triatomine species. Therefore, it is recommended that entomological surveillance be reinforced in CW Brazil.

AB  - Chagas disease remains a public health concern in Brazil and other Latin American countries, mainly due to the potential domiciliation of native triatomine species. We analyzed the genetic variability of Triatoma pseudomaculata in sylvatic and peridomestic ecotopes throughout three localities in the northeastern state of Bahia, Brazil. We studied polymorphisms generated by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and isoenzyme electrophoresis analyses. Based on RAPD analysis, each specimen was assigned to one of three genetic clusters. Although all sylvatic specimens from one locality were grouped into the same cluster, sylvatic and peridomestic specimens from the other two localities were broadly distributed between the remaining two clusters, suggesting that geographic population structuring was not occurring. Furthermore, isoenzyme analysis suggested that distinct populations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Low statistical values for Wright's Fst index also supported the absence of population structuring and suggested the occurrence of panmixia. We conclude that genetic flow occurs between sylvatic and peridomestic T. pseudomaculata populations, probably as a consequence of passive and active dispersion of the insects, associated with deforestation and anthropic transformations.

AB  - Diagnosis, prognosis and evaluation of death risk in Chagas cardiomyopathy still constitute a challenge due to the diversity of manifestations, which determine the importance of using echocardiography, tissue Doppler and biomarkers.
   To evaluate, within a systematic review, clinical and echocardiographic profiles of patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, which may be related to worse prognosis and major mortality risk.
   To perform the systematic review, we used Medline (via PubMed), LILACS and SciELO databases to identify 82 articles published from 1991 to 2012, with the following descriptors: echocardiography, mortality and Chagas disease. We selected 31 original articles, involving diagnostic and prognostic methods.
   The importance of Chagas disease has increased due to its emergence in Europe and United States, but most evidence came from Brazil. Among the predictors of worse prognosis and higher mortality risk are morphological and functional alterations in the left and right ventricles, evaluated by conventional echocardiography and tissue Doppler, as well as the increase in brain natriuretic peptide and troponin I concentrations. Recently, the evaluations of dyssynchrony, dysautonomia, as well as strain, strain rate and myocardial twisting were added to the diagnostic arsenal for the early differentiation of Chagas cardiomyopathy.
   Developments in imaging and biochemical diagnostic procedures have enabled more detailed cardiac evaluations, which demonstrate the early involvement of both ventricles, allowing a more accurate assessment of the mortality risk in Chagas disease.

AB  - Triatoma brasiliensis is the most important vector of Chagas disease in the Caatinga eco-region of northeastern Brazil. Wild T brasiliensis populations have been reported only from rocky outcrops. However, this species frequently infests/re-infests houses in rock-free sedimentary lowlands. We therefore hypothesized that it should also occupy other natural ecotopes. We show that a common Caatinga cactus, Pilosocereus gounellei, locally known as xiquexique, often harbors T brasiliensis breeding colonies apparently associated with rodents (n = 44 cacti, infestation rate = 47.7%, 157 bugs captured). Our findings suggest that infested cacti might be involved in house re-infestation by T brasiliensis in the Caatinga region.

AB  - Ticks from 148 dogs from the urban area of the municipality of Campo Grande, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, were collected, classified and analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the identification of Rickettsia spp., Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. A total of 2015 ticks were collected. The species Rhipicephalus sanguineus (98.9 %) and Amblyomma cajennense (1.1 %) were identified. Molecular analysis revealed that no tick samples were infected by T. cruzi. Regarding Leishmania spp., tick samples from 36 dogs spread across all regions of the municipality were positive for L. chagasi. One tick sample was positive for Rickettsia spp. (gltA gene) in the PCR reaction. This sample was submitted to further PCR based on the ompA gene and the amplicon was sequenced. Identity of 100 % was found with homologous sequences of R. rickettsii available in GenBank. This paper is the first to report the natural infection of R. sanguineus by R. rickettsii in the municipality of Campo Grande, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, mid-western Brazil.

AB  - We report a patient with severe multi-bacillary leprosy complicated by recurrent episodes of erythema nodosum necrotisans that required thalidomide and/or corticosteroids during follow-up. Although the patient was from an area to which Chagas disease is endemic, this diagnosis was initially missed and was only investigated when heart failure developed in the patient. The difficulties of managing erythema nodosum necrotisans and heart failure concomitantly and those involved in excluding the diagnosis of acute myocarditis caused by reactivation of Chagas disease secondary to the immunosuppressive regimen are discussed. Other potential causes for the heart failure and possible interactions between the two diseases and their treatments are discussed. We also reviewed the literature for the association between leprosy and Chagas disease, both of which are highly endemic in Brazil. This case emphasizes the importance of searching for subclinical co-infections in leprosy patients because reactions frequently develop during specific. treatment in these patients, and these reactions require prolonged therapy with immunosuppressive drugs.

AB  - Two journeys have had an important bearing on social thought regarding the Amazon: Carlos Chagas', from 1912 to 1913, and Mario de Andrade's, in 1927. The article examines how their travel experiences influenced these two men's views and interpretations of the relation between malaria and the project to bring civilization to the tropics. In Chagas' texts, wonderment is the category that organizes his perception of the Amazon region, evinced in the idea that the pathology of the tropics challenges established knowledge of the disease. Empathy, on the other hand, is the explanatory key to understanding Mario de Andrade's critical outlook, which entails the valorization of forms of sociability, beliefs, and popular manifestations in the region, including those related to malaria.

AB  - Despite pronounced reductions in the number of deaths due to infectious diseases over the past six decades, infectious diseases are still a public health problem in Brazil. In this report, we discuss the major successes and failures in the control of infectious diseases in Brazil, and identify research needs and policies to further improve control or interrupt transmission. Control of diseases such as cholera, Chagas disease, and those preventable by vaccination has been successful through efficient public policies and concerted efforts from different levels of government and civil society. For these diseases, policies dealt with key determinants (eg, the quality of water and basic sanitation, vector control), provided access to preventive resources (such as vaccines), and successfully integrated health policies with broader social policies. Diseases for which control has failed (such as dengue fever and visceral leishmaniasis) are vector-borne diseases with changing epidemiological profiles and major difficulties in treatment (in the case of dengue fever, no treatment is available). Diseases for which control has been partly successful have complex transmission patterns related to adverse environmental, social, economic, or unknown determinants; are sometimes transmitted by insect vectors that are difficult to control; and are mostly chronic diseases with long infectious periods that require lengthy periods of treatment.

AB  - Between 1950 and 1951, the first Prophylactic campaign against Chagas Diseases was carried on in Brazil by the so existing Servico Nacional de Malaria. The actions involving chemical vector control comprehended 74 municipalities along the Rio Grande Valley, between the States of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais. Ever since, until 1975, the activities were performed according the availability of resources, being executed with more or less regularity and coverage. At that time, Chagas disease did no represent priority, in comparison with other endemic diseases prevalent in the Country. Even so, taking into account the accumulated data along those 25 years, the volume of work realized cannot be considered despicable. Nevertheless, it was few consistent, in terms of its impact on disease transmission. In 1975, with an additional injection of resources surpassed from the malaria program, plus the methodological systematization of the activities, and with the results of two extensive national inquiries (entomologic and serologic), the activities for vector control could be performed regularly, following two basic principles: interventions in always contiguous areas, progressively enlarged, and sustainability (continuity) of the activities, until being attained determined requirements and purpose previously established. Such actions and strategies lead into the exhaustion of the populations of the principal vector species, Triatoma infestans, no autochthonous and exclusively domiciliary, as well as the control of the domiciliary colonization of autochthonous species important to disease transmission. Vector transmission today is being considered residual, by means of some few native and peridomestic species, such as Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma pseudomaculata. There is, also, the risk of progressive domiciliation of some species before considered sylvatic, such as Panstrongylus lutzi and Triatoma rubrovaria. Finally, there is the possibility of the occurrence of cases of human infection directly related to the enzootic cycle of the parasite. By all these reasons, it is still indispensable the maintenance of a strict epidemiological surveillance against Chagas Disease in Brazil.

AB  - Introduction: Despite all efforts to restrict its transmission, Chagas' disease remains a severe public health problem in Latin America, affecting 8-12 million individuals. Chronic Chagas' heart disease, the chief factor in the high mortality rate associated with the illness, affects more than half a million Brazilians. Its evolution may result in severe heart failure associated with loss of functional capacity and quality of life, with important social and medical/labor consequences. Many studies have shown the beneficial effect of regular exercise on cardiac patients, but few of them have focused on chronic Chagas' heart disease. Methods: This study evaluated the effects of an exercise program on the functional capacity of patients with chronic Chagas' disease who were treated in outpatient clinics at the Evandro Chagas Institute of Clinical Research and the National Institute of Cardiology, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The exercises were performed 3 times a week for 1 h (30 min of aerobic activity and 30 min of resistance exercises and extension) over 6 months in 2010. Functional capacity was evaluated by comparing the direct measurement of the O-2 uptake volume (VO2) obtained by a cardiopulmonary exercise test before and after the program (p < 0.05). Results: Eighteen patients (13 females) were followed, with minimum and maximum ages of 30 and 72 years, respectively. We observed an average increase of VO2peak> 10% (p = 0.01949). Conclusions: The results suggest a statistically significant improvement in functional capacity with regular exercise of the right intensity.

AB  - After controlling Triatoma infestans in Brazil, other species of triatomine that were considered minor in the transmission of Chagas disease became important. The persistence of Triatoma brasiliensis in Northeastern Brazil, associated with reinfection of domestic environments recently sprayed with pyrethroids, may be a signal of susceptibility alteration of this species to this insecticide. Specimens of T. brasiliensis from the municipality of Taua, state of Ceara, were captured before and one year after spraying. They were submitted to bioassays using deltamethrin. The LD50 ranged from 0.19-0.33 ng of deltamethrin/nymph. The resistance ratio among samples from Taua varied from 1.16-1.79 in the samples captured before the spraying and 1.00-1.74 in the samples captured one year after spraying, demonstrating that the two populations were equally susceptible to deltamethrin. The small difference in susceptibility between the two captures suggests that T. brasiliensis obtained in the second capture are from new invasions of the domestic environment and that the insecticide did not select resistant individuals. Therefore, it is suggested that T. brasiliensis control be carried out supplementing the regular use of pyrethroids with complementary measures, such as improvement of the dwellings and health education.

AB  - This study aimed at estimating the number of cases of non-negative serological reactions to Chagas disease in blood donors at the Blood Center of Botucatu, Sao Paulo, Brazil, from 2003 to 2010 and at relating them to their cities of origin. Five hundred and seventy-four non-negative results for Chagas disease were evaluated. Of these, 371 (64.8%) were reagent, and 203 (35.4%) were inconclusive. The prevalence of Chagas disease in blood donors was 0.05%. There were, on average, 72 cases/year, and a prevalence of males was observed (64.8%). Forty-three (7.49%) individuals were 18 to 30 years old; 92 (16.02%) were 31 to 40; 147 (25.61%) 41 to 50, and 292 (50.87%) were older than 50 years. It was observed that 29.3% of females with reagent serology were at their fertile age (18 and 45 years). The majority of donors were originally from cities in the southwestern and central regions of Sao Paulo, but individuals from other states contributed with 20%. The provenance of most donors was the city of Botucatu/SP, followed by the city of Taquarituba/SP. Therefore, the profile of donors at this blood center favors the occurrence of a larger number of non-negative serological reactions. Although there has been a significant reduction in the number of new cases/year for this disease, it is still a public-health problem, and results suggest the need for new epidemiological assessments in the studied region.

AB  - This is a long-term follow-up of infection by Trypanosoma cruzi (TC) and Trypanosoma evansi (TE) in the free-ranging coatis (Procyonidae: Nasua nasua) from Pantanal region (Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil). We evaluated TC and TE infection by immunofluorescence assay, hemoculture (HC), and microhematocrit centrifuge techniques (MHCT). We also examined coatis health by quantifying hematological parameters including packed cell volume (PCV), white blood cell (WBC) count, and differential leukocyte count. TC isolates thought HC were typed by miniexon gene. Mixed infections by both parasites and the two main lineages of TC (76% TCI, 3% TCII, and 14% TCI/TCII) were observed. Trypanosoma rangeli was also isolated (7%). Overall, seroprevalence of TC and TE infection were 53.5% and 42.0%, respectively. Positive HC (indicating high TC parasitemia) occurred in 34% of seropositive coatis for TC, and positive MHCT (high TE parasitemia) were observed in 36.4% of seropositive coatis for TE. We detected higher prevalence of positive HC in females (72%) than males (43%), and also during the dry season, indicating a seasonal potential of this host species on TC transmission. These features did not occur for TE infection. However, prevalence of TE based on serology and MHCT was higher among adults than subadults. Coatis with positive HC or MHCT displayed a slight decrease in their WBC. In contrast to the animals with positive HC, coatis with positive MHCT displayed a decrease on their PCV. Moreover, concurrent high TC and TE parasitemia caused a larger decrease of PCV values. This study corroborates the importance of coatis in the maintenance of TC and TE transmission cycles in the southern Pantanal and shows a seasonal character of TC transmissibility to its vector by the coati population from the study area.

AB  - Environmental changes have a strong influence on the emergence and/or reemergence of infectious diseases. The city of Salvador, Brazil - currently the focus of a housing boom linked to massive deforestation-is an example in point as the destruction of the remaining areas of the Atlantic Forest around the city has led to an increased risk for Chagas disease. Human domiciles have been invaded by the triatomine vectors of Trypansoma cruzi, the flagellate protozoan causing Chagas disease, a problem of particular concern in urban/suburban areas of the city such as the Patamares sector in the north-east, where numbers of both the vector and human cases of the disease have increased lately. To control and prevent further deterioration of the situation, the control programme for Chagas disease, developed by the Bahia Center for Zoonosis Control, has divided the area into a grid of designated surveillance units (ZIs) that are subjected to vector examination. In six out of 98 of these ZIs, 988 triatomes were collected and georeferenced during the 3-year period between 2006 and 2009. The hottest months, that are also generally the driest, showed the highest numbers of triatomines with Triatoma tibiamaculata being the predominant species (98.3%) with Panstrongylus geniculatus present only occasionally (0.6%). Fifty-four percent of all triatomines captured were found inside the homes, and 48.6% out of 479 individuals in the affected ZIs selected for analysis tested positive for T. cruzi infection. The study presented here is a pioneering initiative to map the spatial distribution of triatomines based on geographical information systems with the additional aim of contributing to an expanded knowledge-base about T. cruzi and its vectors in urban areas and raise public health awareness of the risks involved.

AB  - Because of control actions, migration and globalization, human Chagas Disease has being reduced in its transmission and concentrating the existing cases in elder age groups, in urban centers of endemic and non endemic countries. In Brazil, now registering few acute cases, the main profile of individuals requesting medical attention will be in the age of 40 and more, with initial cardiopathy and mega syndromes, progressively affected by other chronic and degenerative co-morbidities. Indeterminate form tend to be reduced, as well as the proportion of severe cardiopathy, while mega colon tends to increase its prevalence. The social and economic pattern of infected individuals must continue low, requiring their assistance in the Public Health System. It is ideal that medical attention could be continuous and precociously installed for all the infected individuals. The possible benefits of specific treatment of these elder patients is still under scientific discussion.

AB  - The ethical aspects of the Brazilian publications about human Chagas disease (CD) developed between 1996 and 2010 and the policy adopted by Brazilian medical journals were analyzed. Articles were selected on the SciELO Brazil data basis, and the evaluation of ethical aspects was based on the normative contents about ethics in research involving human experimentation according to the Brazilian resolution of the National Health Council no. 196/1996. The editorial policies of the section "Instructions to authors" were analyzed. In the period of 1996-2012, 58.9% of articles involving human Chagas disease did not refer to the fulfillment of the ethical aspects concerning research with human beings. In 80% of the journals, the requirements and confirmation of the information about ethical aspects in the studies of human CD were not observed. Although a failure in this type of service is still observed, awareness has been raised in federal agencies, educational institutions/research and publishing groups to standardize the procedures and ethical requirements for the Brazilian journals, reinforcing the fulfillment of the ethical parameters, according to the resolution of NHC no. 196/1996.

AB  - The control of the vectors of Chagas' disease in the State of Sao Paulo are discussed, mainly those activities that led to the elimination of Triatoma infestans. Secondary factors that helped the control such as rural exodus are also analyzed. The article shows that since 1965 the control became a campaign with different phases due to the epidemiological situation, the acquired knowledge and the entomological surveillance. After 25 years of work, the elimination of all the focus of Triatoma infestans was finally reached and the campaign was ended. However, due to the possibility of reintroduction of the vector in rural areas by passive transportation besides the presence of secondary vectors (Triatoma sordida and Panstrongylus megistus) in several localities, the vector control activities were not interrupted and the surveillance is continuous.

AB  - Chronic infections during pregnancy are highly prevalent in some parts of the world. Infections with helminths, Trypanosoma cruzi, Plasmodium spp, and HIV might affect the development of fetal immunity and susceptibility to postnatal infections independently of in-utero transmission of the pathogens. Fetal adaptive immune responses are common in neonates who have been exposed to maternal infection during pregnancy but not infected themselves. Such responses could affect the development of immunity to the homologous pathogens and their control during the first few years of life. Fetal innate and regulatory responses might also affect immunity to unrelated pathogens and responses to vaccines. Strategies to improve child health should integrate the possible clinical implications of in-utero exposure to chronic maternal infections.

AB  - After the starting of the Center for studies and prophylaxis of Chagas disease in 1943, with the help of Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, in the city of Bambui, state of Minas Gerais, technological and methodological basis for the extensive control of the disease were conceived. A main step to achieve success was the introduction of a new insecticide (gammexane, P 530) and the demonstration of its efficacy in the vector control. A consequence of these improvements was the official inauguration of the first prophylactic campaign for Chagas disease in Brazil, held in Uberaba in May, 1950. Even with the knowledge of how to control the vectorial transmission, financial resources were not available by this time, at a necessary degree to make it both regularly and in all the affected area. The institutional allocation of these activities is useful to understand the low priority given to them at that time. Several national services were created in 1941, for diseases as malaria, pest, smallpox, among others, but Chagas was included in a group of diseases with lower importance, inside a Division of Sanitary Organization. In 1956, the National Department of Rural endemies (DNERu) allocate all the major endemic diseases in a single institution, however this was not translated in an implementation program for the control of Chagas disease. After profound changes at the Ministry of Health, in 1970, the Superintendencia de Campanhas de Saude Publica (SUCAM) was in charge of all rural endemies including Chagas disease, which now could compete with other diseases transmitted by vectors, formerly priorities, included in the National Division. With this new status, more funds were available, as well as redistribution of personnel and expenses from the malaria program to the vectorial control of Chagas disease. In 1991 the Health National foundation was created to substitute SUCAM in the control of endemic diseases and it included all the units of the Ministry of Health related to epidemiology and disease control. By this time a new tendency for decentralization of these programs was clear. In the case of diseases transmitted by vectors, this was a major difference from the campaign model so far employed. At the same time, the Initiative for the South Cone countries for the control of Chagas disease started, sharing techniques among the countries of this region, as well as establishing similar objectives and trends, what possible helped to maintain Chagas disease as a priority among all the public health issues. From 2003 on, all activities for control of the disease at a national level are under responsibility of the Secretary of Health Surveillance of the Ministry of Health.

AB  - The search toward the establishment of novel serological tests for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis and proper differential diagnosis may represent one alternative to the invasive parasitological methods currently used to identify infected individuals. In the present work, we investigated the potential use of recombinant peroxidoxin (rPeroxidoxin) of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis as a potential antigen for the immunodiagnosis of human tegumentary (TL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL). Linear B-cell epitope mapping was performed to identify polymorphic epitopes when comparing orthologous sequences present in Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent for Chagas disease (CD), and the Homo sapiens and Canis familiaris hosts. The serological assay (ELISA) demonstrated that TL, VL and CVL individuals showed high levels of antibodies against rPeroxidoxin, allowing identification of infected ones with considerable sensitivity and great ability to discriminate (specificity) between non-infected and CD individuals (98.46% and 100%; 98.18% and 95.71%; 95.79% and 100%, respectively). An rPeroxidoxin ELISA also showed a greater ability to discriminate between vaccinated and infected animals, which is an important requirement for the public campaign control of CVL. A depletion ELISA assay using soluble peptides of this B-cell epitope confirmed the recognition of these sites only by Leishmania-infected individuals. Moreover, this work identifies two antigenic polymorphic linear B-cell epitopes of L. braziliensis. Specific recognition of TL and VL patients was confirmed by significantly decreased IgG reactivity against rPeroxidoxin after depletion of peptide-1-and peptide-2-specific antibodies (peptide 1: reduced by 32%, 42% and 5% for CL, ML and VL, respectively; peptide-2: reduced by 24%, 22% and 13% for CL, ML and VL, respectively) and only peptide-2 for CVL (reduced 9%). Overall, rPeroxidoxin may be a potential antigen for the immunodiagnosis of TL, VL or CVL, as it has a higher agreement with parasitological assays and is better than other reference tests that use soluble Leishmania antigens for diagnosing CVL in Brazil (EIE-LVC, Bio-manguinhos, FIOCRUZ).

AB  - The results of the Serological survey for the prevalence of chagasic infection in Brazil, 1975/1980, were published before (Camargo et al, 1984) but the detailed geographical distribution is described in this paper. This was an initiative of two governmental bodies: the Superintendencia de Campanhas de Saude Publica a Ministry of Health Division in charge of all public health policies, and, the Research National Council of the Ministry of Science and Technology through a program called Integrated Program for Endemic Diseases. Results obtained were extremely useful for a precise delimitation of the area with endemic transmission of Chagas disease, and hence, to direct the activities for vector control, which were implemented from 1975 onwards. This survey showed an estimated seroprevalence of 4.2% of T. cruzi infection in the rural population in the country. Only two federal units were not included, Sao Paulo and the Federal District (Brasilia) for which enough recent information was available. This survey included all the other federal units of Brazil, with the examination of 1,626,745 blood samples by indirect immunofluorescence. From them, 1,352,197 were validated for processing and statistical analysis, which were from 3,026 municipalities of 24 states, as by the political division of the country by this time. Overall results obtained, confirmed data that were well known, but some were non expected. These last were subject of further investigations, until confirmation, based also on entomological data and a better interpretation of the results obtained.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease affects more than 15 million people worldwide. Although vector-borne transmission has decreased, oral transmission has become important. Recently, our group published the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the largest outbreak of orally transmitted Chagas disease reported till date.
   Objective: To describe electrocardiographic changes occurring in the study population during the outbreak caused by ingestion of contaminated guava juice.
   Methods: We evaluated 103 positive cases, of which 76 (74%) were aged <= 18 years (average age: 9.1 +/- 3.1 years) and 27 (26%) were aged > 18 years (average age: 46 +/- 11.8 years). All patients underwent clinical evaluations and ECG. If the patients had palpitations or evident alterations of rhythm at baseline, ambulatory ECG monitoring was performed.
   Results: A total of 68 cases (66%; 53 children and 15 adults) had ECG abnormalities. Further, 69.7% (53/76) of those aged <= 18 years and 56% (15/27) of those aged > 18 years showed some ECG alteration (p = ns). ST-T abnormalities were observed in 37.86% cases (39/103) and arrhythmias were evident in 28.16% cases (29/103). ST alterations occurred in 72% of those aged <= 18 years compared with 19% of those aged > 18 years (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: This study reports the largest number of cases in the same outbreak of acute Chagas disease caused by oral contamination, with recorded ECGs. ECG changes suggestive of acute myocarditis and arrhythmias were the most frequent abnormalities found.

AB  - Triatoma brasiliensis (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) is an important vector of Chagas' disease in both sylvatic and peridomestic ecotopes. Discriminating between these populations of Triatominae has been proposed as a means of investigating re-infestation rates of human dwellings. Geometric morphometrics have been widely applied in the study of Triatominae polymorphisms at species and population levels. This study characterizes morphometric differences between sylvatic and peridomestic populations, as well as between sexes in T. brasiliensis specimens from Jaguaruana, Ceara, in northeastern Brazil. No differences in either the shape or size of the cephalic capsule were apparent between sexes or ecotopes. However, the wings showed differentiation in shape and size. Sexual dimorphism was detected, with females presenting significantly higher values and conformations. Size differentiation was also evident, with sylvatic specimens being generally larger than peridomestic examples. These results indicate that differences in the wings of T. brasiliensis may be related to the existence of phenotypic plasticity, and variations in size and shape may be associated with different ecotopes, possibly as a result of conditions in each micro-habitat, such as temperature, relative humidity, food supply and density.

AB  - The cohort study was initiated in 1997 to investigate the incidence and predictors of health outcomes in an elderly population with low socioeconomic level. The eligible population consisted of all 1,742 residents in Bambui, Minas Gerais Slate, Brazil, aged 60 years and over (1,606 participated). During 10 years of follow-up, 641 participants died and 96 were lost, leading to 13,739 person-years of observation. The baseline health profile of participants revealed a double burden of diseases with high prevalence of chronic non-transmissible diseases and widespread Trypanosoma cruzi infection. The most common health condition was hypertension (61.5%), followed by chronic knee or hand symptoms (43.6%), common mental disorders (38.5%), T. cruzi infection (38.1%), and insomnia (36.7%). In general, the baseline prevalence of mental symptoms and cardiovascular diseases or risk factors was comparable to those found in populations in high income countries.

AB  - We examined the extent to which different Thpanosoma cruzi strains induce transcriptomic changes in cultured L6E9 myoblasts 72 hours after infection with Brazil (TC I), Y (TC II), CL (IC II), and Tulahuen (TC II) strains. Expression of 6,289 distinct, fully annotated unigenes was quantified with 27,000 rat oligonucleotide arrays in each of the four replicas of all control and infected RNA samples. Considering changes greater than 1.5-fold and P values < 0.05, the Tulahuen strain was the most disruptive to host transcriptome (17% significantly altered genes), whereas the Y strain altered only 6% of the genes. The significantly altered genes in the infected cells were largely different among the strains, and only 21 genes were similarly changed by all four strains. However, myoblasts infected with different strains showed proportional overall gene-expression alterations. These results indicate that infection with different parasite strains modulates similar but not identical pathways in the host cells.

AB  - Background: Concomitant asymptomatic coronary artery disease in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy in heart failure is controversial in the medical literature, as both diseases are prevalent in some regions of Brazil.
   Objetive: To determine the prevalence of coronary artery disease (lesions > 50%) in a specific population of patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy in HF functional class III and IV, who had no previous coronary events.
   Methods: Coronary angiography was performed in 61 consecutive patients with Chagasic cardiomyopathy, in heart failure functional class III and IV, to exclude coronary artery disease. These patients were part of the Cell Therapy Study in Heart Diseases protocol, which required the coronary angiography to be carried out before stem cells were injected. Risk factors for atherosclerosis also analyzed in this population were: age, arterial hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking and overweight.
   Results: mean age was 51.6 + 9.6 years and 65.5% (n = 40) of them were males. The prevalence of coronary disease in this population was 1.6% (1). The prevalence of risk factors were: arterial hypertension 18% (11), smoking 59% (36), diabetes 1.6% (1) and dyslipidemia, 6.5% (4).
   Conclusion: The prevalence of asymptomatic coronary artery disease in patients with severe heart failure due to Chagas disease is low and among the risk factors for coronary heart disease, smoking was the most prevalent. (Arq Bras Cardiol 2011;97(5):408-412)

AB  - Triatoma matogrossensis is a Hemiptera that belongs to the oliveirai complex, a vector of Chagas' disease that feeds on vertebrate blood in all life stages. Hematophagous insects' salivary glands (SGs) produce potent pharmacologic compounds that counteract host hemostasis, including anticlotting, antiplatelet, and vasodilatory molecules. Exposure to T. matogrossensis was also found to be a risk factor associated with the endemic form of the autoimmune skin disease pemphigus foliaceus, which is described in the same regions where Chagas' disease is observed in Brazil. To obtain a further insight into the salivary biochemical and pharmacologic diversity of this kissing bug and to identify possible allergens that might be associated with this autoimmune disease, a cDNA library from its SGs was randomly sequenced. We present the analysis of a set of 2,230 (SG) cDNA sequences, 1,182 of which coded for proteins of a putative secretory nature.

AB  - Studies that explicitly and specifically take into account the spatial dimension within the study of eco-epidemiological systems remain rare. Our approach of modelling the spatial and/or temporal properties of the entomological and/or epidemiological data before their mapping with possible explanatory variables, objectively underline the significant patterns at different scales. The domiciliary and peri-domiciliary presence and abundance of juvenile and adult vectors of the Chagas disease (Triatoma sordida and Panstrongylus geniculatus) in Bahia state in northeast Brazil, has been modelled by automatically identifying significant multi-scale spatial patterns of the entomological data by the application and adaptation of the spatial modelling methodology proposed by Dray et al. (2006) and based on principal coordinate analysis of neighbour matrices. We found that entomological data can be modelled by a set of eigenvectors that present a significant Moran's I index of spatial autocorrelation. The models for juvenile and adult vectors are defined by 28 and 32 eigenvectors that explain 82.3% and 79.9%, respectively, of the total data variances. The results support insect presence as the outcome both of a local scale "near-to-near" dispersal and an infestation from the wild, surrounding environment that produces a higher insect density at the village periphery.

AB  - Triatoma jatai sp. nov. is the first new species of triatomine to be described in the state of Tocantins, in the northern region of Brazil. It was caught on rock outcrops in the wild environment and, more recently, invading homes. While T. jatai sp. nov. is morphologically similar to Triatoma costalimai, it is distinguished by its general colouring, differences in the blotches on the connexivum, wing size in females and external structures of the male genitalia. The type series has been deposited in the Entomological Collection and Herman Lent Collection, Oswaldo Cruz Institute-Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

AB  - Background: Insulin-like growth factors (IGF) regulate fetal growth through their effects on placenta. Their actions are influenced by IGF binding protein-1. Phosphorylated IGFBP-1 (pIGFBP-1) has high affinity for IGF-I and usually inhibits IGF-I activity but during pregnancy, it is de-phosphorylated to generate lower affinity isoforms and consequently, increased IGF bioavailability. Here we investigate the role of placenta in this process.
   Results: Our data show that term human placental explants, but not their conditioned medium, can de-phosphorylate IGFBP-1 through the action of placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP).
   Discussion: PLAP-mediated de-phosphorylation of IGFBP-1 may provide a mechanism for controlling IGF-I bioavailability and action at the maternal/fetal interface. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - While the former part of this back-to-back paper dealt with the identification of multi-scale spatial patterns associated with the presence, abundance and dispersion of the insect vectors (Triatominae) of Chagas disease, this latter part examines the need for pattern characterisation by means of detailed data on environmental, residential, peri-domiciliary and human behaviour. The study site was, in both cases, a single village situated in Bahia, Brazil, where from the data were collected through field observation and a standardised questionnaire, while the environmental characteristics were derived from satellite images and landscape characterisation. Following this, factorial analysis of mixed group (FAMG), an exploratory data analysis method, was applied to "mine" the huge dataset in a hierarchical way and to evaluate the relative impact of different factors such as the surrounding environment, the domiciliary/peri-domiciliary space properties and the presence of domestic animals. In the study village, five principal "districts" associated with different possible causes of infestation were identified. The results favour the role of depressions of the ground surface due to collapse of karstic subsoil (dolines) and open rock faces as infestation sources, vector attraction by outdoor lighting, risk of insect domiciliation in dwellings constructed without finishing materials and associated with apparent disorder. Ultimately, this study not only provides the basic information needed for decision-making and specification of vector control in the study village, but offers also a knowledge-base for more general control strategies in the region.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate psychiatric comorbidities in outpatients receiving care for HIV and Chagas disease at Instituto de Pesquisa Clinica Evandro Chagas (IPEC), Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study with a consecutive sample of 125 patients referred to an outpatient psychiatric clinic from February to December 2010. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used. Factors associated with more frequent mental disorders were estimated by odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%Cl) by multiple logistic regression.
   Results: Seventy-six (60.8%) patients with HIV, 40 (32%) patients with Chagas disease, and nine (7.2%) patients with human T-Iymphotropic virus were interviewed. The majority were women (64%), with up to 8 years of formal education (56%), and unemployed (81.6%). The median age was 49 years. Suicide risk (n=71) (56%), agoraphobia (n=65) (52%), major depressive episode (n=56) (44.8%), and alcohol/drug abuse (n=43) (34.4%) predominated, the latter being directly associated with lower family income (OR = 2.64; 95%Cl 1.03-6.75) and HIV infection (OR = 5.24; 95%Cl 1.56-17.61). Suicide risk was associated with non-white skin color (OR = 2.21; 95%Cl 1.03-4.75), unemployment (OR = 2.72; 95%Cl 1.01-7.34), and diagnosis of major depression (OR = 3.34; 95%Cl 1.54-7.44).
   Conclusion: Measures targeting adverse socioeconomic conditions and psychiatric and psychological monitoring and care should be encouraged in this population, considering the association with abuse of alcohol/other psychoactive drugs and suicide risk.

AB  - There are six diseases that WHO considers as the major threat in developing countries, leprosy, filariasis, malaria, schistosomiasis, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis; and of these only malaria does not present skin lesions. These diseases are among the so called tropical diseases found in countries of tropical climate, usually infections and infestations considered exotic and rare in European and North American countries. It is extremely important for doctors of all countries to be able to provide correct pre travel counseling and to make early diagnosis and treatment, thus avoiding dissemination of these dieases to non endemic areas. The authors review some important tropical diseases seen in Brazil, as paracoccidiodomycosis, lobomycosis, myiasis, tungiasis, and cutaneous schistosomiasis and discuss new information about them.

AB  - Background: The persistence of Triatoma infestans and the continuous transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi in the Inter-Andean Valleys and in the Gran Chaco of Bolivia are of great significance. Coincidentally, it is in these regions the reach of the vector control strategies is limited, and reports of T. infestans resistance to insecticides, including in wild populations, have been issued. This study aims to characterize the susceptibility to deltamethrin of wild and domestic populations of T. infestans from Bolivia, in order to better understand the extent of this relevant problem.
   Methods: Susceptibility to deltamethrin was assessed in nine, wild and domestic, populations of T. infestans from the Gran Chaco and the Inter-Andean Valleys of Bolivia. Serial dilutions of deltamethrin in acetone (0.2 mu L) were topically applied in first instar nymphs (F1, five days old, fasting, weight 1.2 +/- 0.2 mg). Dose response results were analyzed with PROBIT version 2, determining the lethal doses, slope and resistance ratios (RR). Qualitative tests were also performed.
   Results: Three wild T. infestans dark morph samples of Chaco from the Santa Cruz Department were susceptible to deltamethrin with RR50 of < 2, and 100% mortality to the diagnostic dose (DD); however, two domestic populations from the same region were less susceptible than the susceptibility reference lineage (RR50 of 4.21 and 5.04 respectively and 93% DD). The domestic population of Villa Montes from the Chaco of the Tarija Department presented high levels of resistance (RR50 of 129.12 and 0% DD). Moreover, the domestic populations from the Valleys of the Cochabamba Department presented resistance (RR50 of 8.49 and 62% DD), the wild populations were less susceptible than SRL and T. infestans dark morph populations (RR50 < 5).
   Conclusion: The elimination of T. infestans with pyrethroid insecticides in Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, and its drastic reduction in large parts of Paraguay and Argentina, clearly indicates that pyrethroid resistance was very uncommon in non-Andean regions. The pyrethroid susceptibility of non-Andean T. infestans dark morph population, and the resistance towards it, of Andean T. infestans wild and domestic populations, indicates that the Andean populations from Bolivia are less susceptible.

AB  - Triatoma brasiliensis macromelasoma is revalidated based on the results of previous multidisciplinary studies on the Triatoma brasiliensis complex, consisting of crossing experiments and morphological, biological, ecological and molecular analyses. These taxonomic tools showed the closest relationship between T. b. macromelasoma and Triatoma brasiliensis brasiliensis. T. b. macromelasoma is redescribed based on specimens collected in the type locality and specimens from a F1 colony. The complex now comprises T. b. brasiliensis, T. b. macromelasoma, Triatoma melanica, Triatoma juazeirensis and Triatoma sherlocki. An identification key for all members of the complex is presented. This detailed comparative study of the morphological features of T. b. macromelasoma and the remaining members of the complex corroborates results from multidisciplinary analyses, suggesting that the subspecific status is applicable. This subspecies can be distinguished by the following combination of features: a pronotum with 1+1 narrow brownish-yellow stripes on the submedian carinae, not attaining its apex, hemelytra with membrane cells darkened on the central portion and legs with an incomplete brownish-yellow ring on the apical half of the femora. Because the T. brasiliensis complex is of distinct epidemiological importance throughout its geographic distribution, a precise identification of its five members is important for monitoring and controlling actions against Chagas disease transmission.

AB  - Infectious diseases are the second Leading cause of death worldwide. Noninvasive small-animal imaging has become an important research tool for preclinical studies of infectious diseases. Imaging studies permit enhanced information through longitudinal studies of the same animal during the infection. Herein, we briefly review recent studies of animal models of infectious disease that have used imaging modalities. (Am J Pathol 2013, 182: 296-304; http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.09.026)

AB  - The triatomines are characterized by obligate hematophagy throughout their life cycle, and they are responsible for the transmission of T. cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, to humans and other mammals. Triatoma costalimai was described by Verano & Galvao (1959) based on nine specimens found among rocks in the municipality of Taguatinga, Goias State, Brazil. The species was named in honor of Angelo Moreira da Costa Lima, an entomologist from the Oswaldo Cruz Institute. It is a sylvatic species but has been found in peridomestic areas and human dwellings in the States of Bahia, Goias, Mato Grosso, and Minas Gerais, Brazil. Nymphs and eggs of T. costalimai were described using optical microscopy. The eggs are ellipsoid in shape, and most cells are pentagonal. Nymphs display morphological differences, and the colors, legs, and head maintain the same pattern in most instars. Ontogenetic morphometrics was used to visualize the changes that occur during nymphal development. The results showed the discrimination of all instars, but the largest change occurs between the first and second instars.

AB  - Entomopathogenic fungi attack Chagas disease vectors, and there is a need of effective isolates for development of biological control. Ten isolates of Metarhizium spp., four of Isaria cateniannulata and two of an Isaria sp., all isolated with Triatoma infestans as a bait insect from soils collected in Central Brazil, and tested under laboratory conditions were effective against third instar nymphs of T. infestans. This is the first report of pathogenicity of M. flavoviride var. pemphigi. M. robertsii and I. cateniannulata against T. infestans. M. robertsii IP 34 and I. cateniannulata IP 141 are among the most virulent fungi reported, and both have potential for integrated control of triatomine vectors.

AB  - Dogs and cats in Brazil serve as primary hosts for a considerable number of parasites, which may affect their health and wellbeing. These may include endoparasites (e.g., protozoa, cestodes, trematodes, and nematodes) and ectoparasites (i.e., fleas, lice, mites, and ticks). While some dog and cat parasites are highly host-specific (e.g., Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Felicola subrostratus for cats, and Angiostrongylus vasorum and Trichodectes canis for dogs), others may easily switch to other hosts, including humans. In fact, several dog and cat parasites (e.g., Toxoplasma gondii, Dipylidium caninum, Ancylostoma caninum, Strongyloides stercoralis, and Toxocara canis) are important not only from a veterinary perspective but also from a medical standpoint. In addition, some of them (e.g., Lynxacarus radovskyi on cats and Rangelia vitalii in dogs) are little known to most veterinary practitioners working in Brazil. This article is a compendium on dog and cat parasites in Brazil and a call for a One Health approach towards a better management of some of these parasites, which may potentially affect humans. Practical aspects related to the diagnosis, treatment, and control of parasitic diseases of dogs and cats in Brazil are discussed.

AB  - Between the years 1976 and 1980, the American trypanosomiasis was searched for among residents in two geographic microregions of the State of Sao Paulo: Campos de Itapetininga, in the region of Sorocaba, and Encosta Ocidental da Mantiqueira Paulista, in the region of Campinas. Both areas have in the past been colonized by Triatoma infestans. Campos de Itapetininga remained, until the beginning of the 1970s as a stronghold of this species in the State of Sao Paulo. Panstrongylus megistus has currently colonized in these areas, now classified as having serological titer profiles characteristic of low endemicity. Transmission of Chagas disease was interrupted earlier in the Encosta Ocidental. Intense exposure to the vector in Campos de Itapetininga can explain the seroreactivity frequencies observed in people born before 1956, aged more than 20 years. Among the residents in this region born between 1972 and 1977, a low positivity rate remains, which might also include cases of congenital transmission. The mean age of seroreagents resident in the Encosta indicates that they must have been born in the 1930s; positivity levels here vary in different municipalities according to their growth in capital goods. After 1984 new criteria were adopted for the use of serology in the Program for the Control of Chagas disease, the detection of seroreagents has not been statistically associated to notification of the occurrence of domestic triatomines in these regions.

AB  - The affect can influence health risk and benefit perceptions and consumer behavior. Acai is widely consumed in the Amazon region. Acute Chagas disease outbreaks involving acai have been reported. The objective of this study was to identify affect related to acai. The relationship between affect and consumer perception of risks and benefits and socioeconomic characteristics were also studied. Data collection was performed in the city of Coari, Amazonas State, through interviews with 250 subjects. The scores of affect and perception were analyzed by the means of a 5-point response scale. Descriptive data analysis was performed with the help of XLSTAT 2011 software. The affect identified among consumers was positive. A significant positive correlation between the affect and the perceived benefit (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.207, p=0.001) was observed. No significant differences were identified between the affect and socioeconomic variables. The conception of education programs regarding acai for the studied population should take into consideration the probable influence of the affect on benefit perception.

AB  - Background: Chagas' disease is an important public health concern in Latin America. Despite intensive vector control efforts using pyrethroid insecticides, the elimination of Triatoma infestans has failed in the Gran Chaco, an ecoregion that extends over Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil. The voltage-gated sodium channel is the target site of pyrethroid insecticides. Point mutations in domain II region of the channel have been implicated in pyrethroid resistance of several insect species.
   Methods and Findings: In the present paper, we identify L925I, a new pyrethroid resistance-conferring mutation in T. infestans. This mutation has been found only in hemipterans. In T. infestans, L925I mutation occurs in a resistant population from the Gran Chaco region and is associated with inefficiency in the control campaigns. We also describe a method to detect L925I mutation in individuals from the field.
   Conclusions and Significance: The findings have important implications in the implementation of strategies for resistance management and in the rational design of campaigns for the control of Chagas' disease transmission.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis is a chronic infectious disease caused by Leishmania infantum (synonym: Leishmania chagasi) and transmitted by the sandfly Lutzomyia longipalpis in Brazil. It is an endemic zoonosis in several regions of the country, including Belo Horizonte (State of Minas Gerais). In urban areas, the domestic dog is susceptible and considered the most important animal reservoir. However, L. infantum has been previously diagnosed in other species, including captive primates and canids. This study aimed to evaluate the presence of the agent DNA in captive animals as well as some free ranging animals from the Zoo-Botanical Foundation of Belo Horizonte by Polymerase Chain Reaction. Eighty one blood samples from primates, carnivores, ruminants, edentates, marsupial, and a monogastric herbivore were analyzed. Three primates Alouatta guariba (brown howler monkey), and two canids Speothos venaticus (bush dog) were positive, demonstrating the importance of leishmaniasis control in endemic areas for preservation of wildlife species in captivity.

AB  - Introduction: Chagasic megaesophagus (CM) is the most common digestive manifestation of Chagas disease in Brazil, and the State of Goias is one of the most affected regions. In recent decades, the Hospital das Clinicas (HC)/Universidade Federal de Goias (UFG) has been a reference center for the study and treatment of CM. The objective of this study was to characterize the current epidemiological profile of patients with CM observed at the HC of the UFG from 1998 to 2010. Methods: In total, 939 patient records were analyzed, and age, gender, place of birth, serology, symptoms and radiological classification according to Rezende et al. were analyzed. Results: The median patient age was 55 years. Male patients were more (54%) prevalent than female patients. The prevalence of younger patients (less than 31 years of age) was 4.2%, but 82.1% of the younger patients were from State of Bahia. Patients older than 40 years were the majority (85.5%). The radiological groups were distributed as follows: Group I(35.9%), Group II (32.9%), Group III (17%) and Group IV (14.2%). Conclusions: Compared with previous studies by the same group in 1975, 1994 and 1995, the number of younger patients decreased, and the frequency curve has shifted to older patients.

AB  - Introduction: Since 1970, lengthening of the rectosigmoid has been suspected to be a solitary manifestation of Chagas colopathy. Methods: To test this hypothesis, opaque enema was administered on 210 seropositive and 63 seronegative patients, and radiographs in the anteroposterior and posteroanterior positions were examined blind to the serological and clinical findings. The distal colon was measured using a flexible ruler along the central axis of the image from the anus to the iliac crest. Results: Dolichocolon was diagnosed in 31 (14.8%) seropositive and 3 (4.8%) seronegative patients. The mean length was 57.2 (+/- 12.2) cm in seropositive patients and 52.1 (+/- 8.8) cm in the seronegative patients (p = 0.000), that is, the distal colon in Chagas patients was, on average, 5.1cm longer. Seropositive female patients presented a mean length of 58.8 (+/- 12.3) cm, and seronegative female patients presented 53.2 (+/- 9.1) cm (p = 0.002). Seropositive male patients had a mean length of 55 (+/- 11.6) cm, and seronegative male patients had 49.9 (+/- 7.8) cm (p = 0.02). Among 191 patients without megacolon and suspected megacolon, the mean length was 56.3 (+/- 11.6) cm in seropositive individuals and 52 (+/- 8.8) cm in seronegative patients (p = 0.003). Among individuals with distal colon >= 70cm, there were 31 Chagas patients with mean length of 77.9 (+/- 7.1) cm and three seronegative with 71.3 (+/- 1.1) cm (p = 0.000). Among 179 with distal colon <70cm, seropositive individuals had a mean length of 53.6 (+/- 8.8) cm, and seronegative patients had 51.2 (+/- 7.8) cm (p = 0.059). Serological positive women had longer distal colon than men (p = 0.02), whereas the mean length were the same among seronegative individuals (p = 0.16). Conclusions: In endemic areas of Brazil Central, solitary dolichocolon is a radiological Chagas disease signal.

AB  - Introduction. The number of foreign migrants tends to grow. The situation of people living away from their own country is complex and has an impact on the public health system. The objective of this article was to analyze the perinatal risk of migrant mothers and their newborn infants in comparison to native Argentine mothers and their newborn infants.
   Methods. Cohort study that included 2000 mothers and their newborn infants (1000 migrants and 1000 natives) assisted at a public maternity hospital.
   Results. Native mothers had a higher rate of low birth weight newborn infants (9.9% versus 5.3%; p < 0.01), primiparity (42% versus 37%; p=0.012), and adolescent pregnancy (6% versus 1.3%; p < 0.001). Migrant women had a higher rate of poorly controlled pregnancies (21.7% versus 13.4%; p < 0.01), positive serology for Chagas disease (3.2% versus 0.4%; p < 0.01), and newborn infants requiring phototherapy (20.5% versus 14.3%; p = 0.04).
   Conclusion. In our study, Argentine mothers had a higher rate of low birth weight newborn infants, primiparity and adolescent pregnancies, while immigrant women had higher rate of positive serology for Chagas disease, poor antenatal controls and more newborn infants requiring phototherapy.

AB  - Paracoccidioidomycosis has been known for over 100 years, and until now, there were only few estimates of the disease's incidence. We aim to analyze 1,000 cases treated between 1960 and 1999 at Ribeirao Preto city, Sao Paulo, Brazil, where the disease's incidence range detected was 1.6 to 3.7 cases per 100,000 habitants per year (mean = 2.7 cases/year). We observed a male to female ratio of 6:1 and an age distribution from 3 to 85 years. The acute/subacute form of the disease accounted for 25.4% of cases. Most of the patients (93.5%) had lived or worked in rural areas before the disease development. Smoking and alcoholism were reported by 64.7% and 37.2% of patients, respectively. Comorbidities identified included tuberculosis (8.3%), Chagas' disease (8.6%), and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (4.2%). The present study revealed an area in Brazil where paracoccidioidomycosis is hyperendemic (has the highest reported incidence of this disease); this endemic area is probably caused by geological and climatic conditions as well as intensive agriculture.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease is still an important endemic disease in Brazil, and the cardiac involvement is its more severe manifestation.
   Objective: To verify whether the concomitant use of carvedilol will enhance the antioxidant effect of vitamins E and C in reducing the systemic oxidative stress in chronic Chagas heart disease.
   Methods: A total of 42 patients with Chagas heart disease were studied. They were divided into four groups according to the modified Los Andes classification: 10 patients in group IA (normal electrocardiogram and echocardiogram; no cardiac involvement); 20 patients in group IB (normal electrocardiogram and abnormal echocardiogram; mild cardiac involvement); eight patients in group II (abnormal electrocardiogram and echocardiogram; no heart failure; moderate cardiac involvement); and four patients in group III (abnormal electrocardiogram and echocardiogram with heart failure; severe cardiac involvement). Blood levels of markers of oxidative stress were determined before and after a six-month period of treatment with carvedilol, and six months after combined therapy of carvedilol with vitamins E and C. The markers analyzed were as follows: activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase and reductase, myeloperoxidade and adenosine deaminase; and the levels of reduced glutathione, thiobarbituric-acid reactive substances, protein carbonyls, vitamin E, and nitric oxide.
   Results: After treatment with carvedilol, all groups showed significant decrease in protein carbonyls and reduced glutathione levels, whereas nitric oxide levels and adenosine activity increased significantly only in the less severely affected group (IA). In addition, the activity of most of the antioxidant enzymes was decreased in the less severely affected groups (IA and IB). By combining the vitamins with carvedilol, a reduction in protein damage, in glutathione levels, and in the activity of most of the antioxidant enzymes were observed.
   Conclusions: The decrease in oxidative stress levels observed by means of the markers tested was more significant when carvedilol was used in combination with the antioxidant vitamins. The findings suggest that both carvedilol alone and in combination with the vitamins were effective in attenuating the systemic oxidative stress in patients with Chagas heart disease, especially those less severely affected, thus suggesting the possibility of synergism between these compounds.

AB  - In the present study was analyzed the intrauterine development of Wistar rats fetuses that received an injection of 2x10(5) bloodstream trypomastigotes of Planalto (IP1) and ASM (IP2) Trypanosoma cruzi strains. The rats with 12 days post-infection were mated; at day 20 the pregnat rats were sacrificed and its fetuses were extracted from the uterine horns in order to be evaluated. Healthy pregnant rats (HP) and virgin rats (CI1, CI2) were used as controls. The results showed that parasitemia was significanty (P<0.05) higher in pregnancy rats in comparison with the virgins rats CI1 and CI2 infected with different T. cruzi strains. The rats IP1, showed 19 fetuses with weight and measure average of 2.86 g +/- 2.19 and 2.63 +/- 1.17 cm of length. One rat showed 1 fetus in the left uterine horn, other rat showed the left uterine horn with inflammated aspect and with fetal and placental rests, and 6 fetuses of normal aspect into right uterine horn; in two rats were observed 8 and 4 fetuses of normal aspect. The pregnant rats IP2, developed 28 fetuses with weight and measure average of 2.77 +/- 0.77 g and 3.31 +/- 1.99 cm; in one rat, the 4 fetuses (57.14%) of right uterine horn presented morphological malformations on the dorsal side of the body, tightness around the body and development his anterior right footpad with big size and the left uterine horn of same rat was observed 3 fetuses with normal aspect; other rat showed 2 fetuses dead and dense amniotic liquid into right horn, and 5 fetuses with normal aspect in the left uterine horn, in two rats were developed 8 and 6 fetuses with normal aspect respectively. The HP development 21 fetuses with normal aspect of weight and measure average of 6.16 +/- 0.99 g and 2.88 +/- 0.65 cm of length. The relation weight/length fetal (g/cm) in infected pregnant rats groups IP1 and IP2 was significantly less in comparison with fetuses of HP rats (P<0.00001). The comparison of the fetal weight and placental diameters of IP1, IP2 and HP rats were significant (P<0.001). In conclusion, acute infection with different T. cruzi strains in pregnant rats, produces pathologic restriction of fetal growth, functional structural morphological anomalies in the fetuses and death of some fetuses. The fetuses of HP rats did not show any anomaly.

AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence and the prognostic value of exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmia (EIVA) in chronic Chagas heart disease.
   Study Design and Setting: An open prospective cohort of 130 clinically stable patients at a University Hospital outpatient unit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was followed up at scheduled clinical visits from 1990 through 2007. The endpoint was total cardiovascular mortality. Survival curves (Kaplan-Meier) and a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model were adjusted to determine the association between EIVA and mortality.
   Results: The median duration of follow-up was 9.9 years (range, 132 days to 17 years). EIVA prevalence was 43.1% (95% CI: 34.5-51.7). Thirty-three cardiovascular deaths (25.4%) occurred. The hazard ratio of EIVA for cardiovascular death, after adjustment for age, was 1.84 (P = 0.09). An interaction was found between EIVA and cardiomegaly on x-ray. In the group with cardiomegaly, the hazard of dying was four times greater in the presence of EIVA (P for interaction = 0.05).
   Conclusion: In clinically stable chagasic subjects with cardiomegaly, EIVA is a clinically significant marker of total cardiovascular mortality and may be a useful risk stratification tool in this population. (PACE 2011; 34: 1492-1497)

AB  - Trypanosoma (Megatrypanum) theileri from cattle and trypanosomes of other artiodactyls form a clade of closely related species in analyses using ribosomal sequences. Analysis of polymorphic sequences of a larger number of trypanosomes from broader geographical origins is required to evaluate the Clustering of isolates as suggested by previous studies. Here, we determined the sequences of the spliced leader (SL) genes of 21 isolates from cattle and 2 from water buffalo from distant regions of Brazil. Analysis of SL gene repeats revealed that the 5S rRNA gene is inserted within the intergenic region. Phylogeographical patterns inferred using SL sequences showed at least 5 major genotypes of T. theileri distributed in 2 strongly divergent lineages. Lineage TthI comprises genotypes IA and IB from buffalo and cattle, respectively, from the Southeast and Central regions, whereas genotype IC is restricted to cattle from the Southern region. Lineage Tth II includes cattle genotypes IIA, which is restricted to the North and Northeast, and IIB, found in the Centre, West, North and Northeast. PCR-RFLP of SL genes revealed valuable markers for genotyping T. theileri. The results of this study emphasize the genetic complexity and corroborate the geographical structuring of T. theileri genotypes found in cattle.

AB  - Bayesian latent-class models have been widely applied for assessing the performance of diagnostic tests in the absence of a gold standard. We provide a short discussion on identifiability issues appearing under the absence of a gold standard, and construct an extension of the well-known Hui-Walter stratification model which allows for stratum-dependent parameters. We illustrate our approach using a Chagas disease case study on blood donors from Brazil.

AB  - Objective To test the hypothesis that 12-lead ECG QRS scoring quantifies myocardial scar and correlates with disease severity in Chagas' heart disease.
   Design Patients underwent 12-lead ECG for QRS scoring and cardiac magnetic resonance with late gadolinium enhancement (CMR-LGE) to assess myocardial scar.
   Setting University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   Patients 44 Seropositive patients with Chagas' disease without a history of myocardial infarction and at low risk for coronary artery disease.
   Main outcome measures Correlation between QRS score, CMR-LGE scar size and left ventricular ejection fraction. Relation between QRS score, heart failure (HF) class and history of ventricular tachycardia (VT).
   Results QRS score correlated directly with CMR-LGE scar size (R=0.69, p<0.0001) and inversely with left ventricular ejection fraction (R=-0.54, p=0.0002), which remained significant in the subgroup with conduction defects. Patients with class II or III HF had significantly higher QRS scores than those with class I HF (5.1 +/- 3.4 vs 2.1 +/- 3.1 QRS points (p=0.002)) and patients with a history of VT had significantly higher QRS scores than those without a history of VT (5.3 +/- 3.2% vs 2.6 +/- 3.4 QRS points (p=0.02)). A QRS score >= 2 points had particularly good sensitivity and specificity (95% and 83%, respectively) for prediction of large CMR-LGE, and a QRS score >= 7 points had particularly high specificity (92% and 89%, respectively) for predicting significant left ventricular dysfunction and history of VT.
   Conclusions The wide availability of 12-lead ECG makes it an attractive screening tool and may enhance clinical risk stratification of patients at risk for more severe, symptomatic Chagas' heart disease.

AB  - This article aims to correlate the main results of three large national surveys on Chagas disease (entomologic, seroprevalence and electrocardiographic) carried out in Brazil from late 1970's to early 1980's, which served as baseline for definition of the control measures adopted in the country. The proportion of infected people was much higher in areas where Triatoma infestans, the most efficient vector of Chagas disease among the five principal species involved in transmission at that time, was predominant. Similar result was observed in places where Triatoma sordida was dispersed, mainly in the country's central region, which corresponds to its native area. This finding is due to the coincidence observed in the geographic distribution of both vectors, since T. sordida is not considered to play an important role in transmission. In the Northeastern semi-arid, endemic area for Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma pseudomaculata, rates of human infection were much lower, although both vectors may have some relevance in the maintenance of the disease. As for areas with Panstrongylus megistus, human infection varied according to the levels of domiciliation. Whenever domiciled, like in the humid northeastern coastal area, its involvement in transmission can be clearly demonstrated. In some parts of Bahia State it represented the exclusive vector of the disease. Based upon the results of the seroprevalence survey an electrocardiographic study was carried out in 11 Brazilian states, which showed marked differences in the presence of cardiac alterations when comparing different areas of the country.

AB  - In the present work, we investigated whether it is possible to detect morphometric changes in Rhodnius neglectus Lent, 1954 (a candidate vector of Chagas disease in Central Brazil) populations in the transition from sylvatic to laboratory conditions. We analyzed size and shape variation in wings of sylvatic parents and their laboratory descendents (first, third and fifth generations) using geometric morphometric techniques. Sexual size dimorphism and shape of wings were maintained, but wing size decreased from sylvatic specimens to their laboratory generations. Size variation in R. neglectus should reflect the expected morphometric changes between sylvatic and domestic populations and can be applied to analyze the level of adaptation of R. neglectus to domestic habitats. This information might be useful to detect persistent infestations in dwellings after insecticide application, or new infestations from the sylvatic environment, and is therefore important to guide vector surveillance strategies for Chagas disease.

AB  - Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are now a first-line option for prevention of sudden death in Chagas disease (ChD). However, efficacy and safety of ICD treatment in ChD remains controversial. The aim of our study was to compare clinical outcome after ICD implantation in ChD and non-ChD patients.
   The study population consists of patients who received ICD implantation in a tertiary Reference Center for ChD in Brazil. The primary endpoint of the study was appropriate therapy (appropriate shocks or anti-tachycardia pacing); the secondary endpoint was the event-free survival defined as absence of death or appropriate therapy. Three hundred thirty-five patients were followed for the median time of 266 days. Sixty-five patients had ChD. Appropriate ICD therapy occurred in 32 (49.2) ChD and in 19 (27.1) non-ChD patients (P0.005). Ventricular tachycardia occurred in 27 (42) ChD and in 16 (23) non-ChD (P 0.01) patients. There was a statistically significant difference in event-free survival between the group of patients with and without ChD (P0.004). The median event-free survival was 230 days (95 confidence interval, CI: 113347) in patients with ChD and 549 days (95 CI: 412687) in non-ChD patients. Chagas disease double the risk of the patient to have appropriate therapy (hazard ratio, HR 2.2, 95 CI 1.24.3, P 0.02) and appropriate therapy or death (HR 2.2, 95 CI 1.24.2, P 0.01) in multivariate analysis. There were 16 deaths (11.8) with 8 deaths in each group and five inappropriate shocks (3.7) with one in ChD patients (1.6).
   The higher frequency of appropriate ICD therapy and the shorter event-free survival in ChD patients are consistent with the presence of an arrhythmogenic substrate that characterizes this cardiomyopathy.

AB  - Background: Chagas' cardiomyopathy (CC) is a rising etiology for heart failure (HF) that previously was restricted to some countries of Latin America. The chronic CC cases cause now a profound socio-economic impact. However this issue has not been well studied if compared to other causes of HF. The objective of this study was to assess the cost burden of CC during acute decompensated HF admissions (ADHF), and compare this cost to the other etiologies of HF.
   Methods and results: By the end of 2006 we started a five year follow-up of 577 consecutive adult patients admitted at a high complexity cardiology university hospital in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. This study shows the data of the first admission of each patient of this follow-up. Patients were divided in two groups: CC (58 patients) and non-chagasic (NC) (519 patients). Mortality was different among groups, 19/58 (32.8%) in CC vs 113/519 (21.8%) in NC (p=0.046). The prevalence of signs of inadequate perfusion was higher in the CC group at admission, but in a multivariated analysis chagasic etiology and presence of diabetes were independent predictors of higher costs per day of hospitalization adjusted by mortality. Median costs per day were US$308 (277-542) vs US$467 (323-815) for NC and CC respectively (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: Treating ADHF patients with CC etiology was more expensive and mortality was higher in this population at the first admission of this follow-up. This could be explained by the severity of Chagas' cardiomyopathy disease. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Brazil, the percentage of infected dogs living in areas where canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is endemic ranges from 10 to 62%; however, the prevalence of infection in dogs is probably higher than figures reported from serological studies. In addition, problems with the occurrence of false-positive or false-negative results in the serodiagnosis of CVL have been reported. The present work analyzed the potential of synthetic peptides mapped from hypothetical proteins for improvement of the serodiagnosis of Leishmania infantum infection in dogs. From 26 identified leishmanial proteins, eight were selected, considering that no homologies between these proteins and others from trypanosomatide sequence databases were encountered. The sequences of these proteins were mapped to identify linear B-cell epitopes, and 17 peptides were synthesized and tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the serodiagnosis of L. infantum infection in dogs. Of these, three exhibited sensitivity and specificity values higher than 75% and 90%, respectively, to differentiate L. infantum-infected animals from Trypanosoma cruzi-infected animals and healthy animals. Soluble Leishmania antigen (SLA) showed poor sensitivity (4%) and specificity (36%) to differentiate L. infantum-infected dogs from healthy and T. cruzi-infected dogs. Lastly, the three selected peptides were combined in different mixtures and higher sensitivity and specificity values were obtained, even when sera from T. cruzi-infected dogs were used. The study's findings suggest that these three peptides can constitute a potential tool for more sensitive and specific serodiagnosis of L. infantum infection in dogs.

AB  - Introduction: In this study, we investigated radiological changes in the sigmoid colon in chagasic patients by comparing their colon lengths and caliber with those of non-chagasic living in the same region and non-chagasic living at high altitudes. Methods: A total of 317 individuals were evaluated using clinical, serological and radiological methods and divided into three groups: 1) one hundred and nine non-chagasic individuals from Uberaba, Brazil; 2) sixty-one non-chagasic from Puno, Peru; 3) one hundred forty-seven chagasics examined in Uberaba, being 62 without megacolon (3A), 72 with megacolon (3B) and 13 with doubtful diagnosis of megacolon (3C). Results: In group 2, the sigmoid colon had a significantly larger caliber (p=0.001) and the rectosigmoid colon was longer (p<0.001) than group 1. In subgroup 3A, the sigmoid colon (p<0.001) and rectum (p<0.001) had a significantly larger caliber and the rectosigmoid was longer (p<0.001) than that of the non-chagasic individuals. In subgroup 3B, the rectosigmoid was longer in all patients, and the caliber of the sigmoid was significantly larger than that of subjects in subgroups 3A and 3C (p<0.001). Conclusions: Morphometric analysis confirms that Chagas disease may increase the caliber and length of the rectosigmoid. Our results suggest that altitude, ethnicity and diet may have influenced the size and length of the rectosigmoid of andean patients.

AB  - Introduction: Biological collections are depositories of information on different species and contribute to the knowledge, protection, conservation and maintenance of biodiversity. Methods: A list of triatomine species currently included in the Collection of Chagas Disease Vectors (FIOCRUZ-COLVEC) was prepared from the database made available by the Reference Center on Environmental Information. Results: COLVEC curatorship houses 4,778 specimens of triatomines, of which 811 come from other American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, the United States of America, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela) and 3,967 are autochthonous from Brazil. Altogether, 56 species of Chagas disease vectors are represented in the COLVEC: two species of the Tribe Cavernicolini Usinger, 1944; fifteen species of the tribe Rhodniini Pinto, 1926, of which 12 are of the genus Rhodnius and 3 are of the genus Psamolestes; and 39 species of the tribe Triatomini Jeannel, 1919, represented by the genus Dipetalogaster, two species of the genus Eratyrus, two of the genus Meccus, seven of the genus Panstrongylus and 27 of the genus Triatoma. Conclusions: This list provides important data on the diversity of triatomines currently included in COLVEC, including the expanded area of Panstrongylus lutzi occurrence in the municipalities Pirapora and Januaria, State of Minas Gerais. The maintenance and expansion of the collection ensures the preservation of biodiversity and further studies.

AB  - Trichuris thrichomysi n. sp., recovered from the cecum of the wild rodent Thrichomys apereoides from a transition zone between the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado morfoclimatic domains, and its life cycle observed under experimental conditions are described. This new species is closely related to Trichuris travassosi, Trichuris chiliensis and Trichuris fulvi, but can be distinguished from them mainly by differences in the posterior end of males. Details of the surface such as the bacillary gland, cuticular inflations and several morphological details obtained by scanning electron microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy confirmed the characteristics that differentiate the new species.

AB  - Introduction: This study analyzed the occurrence and the contamination of triatomines by trypanosomatids in Orbignya speciosa (babassu) specimens in the State of Rondonia, Brazil, in two different environments (pasture and woods). Methods: Capture of triatomines on babassus and microscopic search for trypanosomatids in their digestive tube were carried out. Results: Four hundred ninety-four (494) specimens were captured (Rhodnius prolixus and R.robustus), of which 35.6% of the triatomines were positive for trypanosomatids. Conclusions: The high index of natural infection along with the abundance of triatomines points out to the necessity to create an epidemiological surveillance system to monitor vector-borne transmission and deepen the studies on the ecology of such vectors in the Amazon.

AB  - Introduction: Toxoplasma gondii is an opportunistic protozoan parasite responsible for toxoplasmosis. T. gondii is able to infect a wide range of hosts, particularly humans and warm-blooded animals. Toxoplasmosis can be considered as one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases affecting close to one billion people worldwide, but its current chemotherapy is still deficient and is only effective in the acute phase of the disease.
   Areas covered: This review covers different approaches to toxoplasmosis chemotherapy focused on the metabolic differences between the host and the parasite. Selective action on different targets such as the isoprenoid pathway, dihydrofolate reductase, T. gondii adenosine kinase, different antibacterials, T. gondii histone deacetylase and calcium-dependent protein kinases is discussed.
   Expert opinion: A new and safe chemotherapy is needed, as T. gondii causes serious morbidity and mortality in pregnant women and immunodeficient patients undergoing chemotherapy. A particular drawback of the available treatments is the lack of efficacy against the tissue cyst of the parasite. During this review a broad scope of several attractive targets for drug design have been presented. In this context, the isoprenoid pathway, dihydrofolate reductase, T. gondii histone deacetylase are promising molecular targets.

AB  - The next FIFA World Cup will be held in Brazil in June-July 2014. Around 600,000 international visitors and participants (as well over 3 million domestic travelers) are expected. This event will take place in twelve cities. This event poses specific challenges, given its size and the diversity of attendees, including the potential for the transmission of imported or endemic communicable diseases, especially those that have an increased transmission rate as a result of close human proximity, eg, seasonal influenza, measles but also tropical endemic diseases. In anticipation of increased travel, a panel of experts from the Latin American Society for Travel Medicine (SLAMVI) developed the current recommendations regarding the epidemiology and risks of the main communicable diseases in the major potential destinations, recommended immunizations and other preventives measures to be used as a basis for advice for travelers and travel medicine practitioners.
   Mosquito-borne infections also pose a challenge. Dengue poses a significant risk in all states, including the host cities. Vaccination against yellow fever is recommended except for travelers who will only visit coastal areas. Travelers visiting high-risk areas for malaria (Amazon) should be assessed regarding the need for chemoprophylaxis. Chikunguya fever may be a threat for Brazil, given the presence of Aedes aegypti, vector of dengue, and the possibility of travelers bringing the virus with them when attending the event. Advice on the correct timing and use of repellents and other personal protection measures is key to preventing these vector-borne infections. Other important recommendations for travelers should focus on preventing water and food-borne diseases such as hepatitis A, typhoid fever, giardiasis and traveler's diarrhea. Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) should be also mentioned and the use of condoms advocated.
   This review addresses pre-travel, preventive strategies to reduce the risk of acquiring communicable diseases during a mass gathering such as the World Cup and also reviews the spectrum of endemic infections in Brazil to facilitate the recognition and management of infectious diseases in travelers returning to their countries of origin.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a zoonotic disease that is endemic to Brazil, where dogs are the main domestic parasite reservoirs, and the percentages of infected dogs living in regions where canine VL (CVL) is endemic have ranged from 10% to 62%. Despite technological advances, some problems have been reported with CVL serodiagnosis. The present study describes a sequential subtractive selection through phage display technology from polyclonal antibodies of negative and positive sera that resulted in the identification of potential bacteriophage-fused peptides that were highly sensitive and specific to antibodies of CVL. A negative selection was performed in which phage clones were adhered to purified IgGs from healthy and Trypanosoma cruzi-infected dogs to eliminate cross-reactive phages. The remaining supernatant nonadhered phages were submitted to positive selection against IgG from the blood serum of dogs that were infected with Leishmania infantum. Phage clones that adhered to purified IgGs from the CVL-infected serum samples were selected. Eighteen clones were identified and their reactivities tested by a phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (phage-ELISA) against the serum samples from infected dogs (n = 31) compared to those from vaccinated dogs (n = 21), experimentally infected dogs with cross-reactive parasites (n = 23), and healthy controls (n = 17). Eight clones presented sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 100%, and they showed no cross-reactivity with T. cruzi-or Ehrlichia canis-infected dogs or with dogs vaccinated with two different commercial CVL vaccines in Brazil. Our study identified eight mimotopes of L. infantum antigens with 100% accuracy for CVL serodiagnosis. The use of these mimotopes by phage-ELISA proved to be an excellent assay that was reproducible, simple, fast, and inexpensive, and it can be applied in CVL-monitoring programs.

AB  - Schistosomiasis mansoni remains an important parasitic disease of man, endemic in large parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, South America and the Caribbean. The aetiological agent is the trematode Schistosoma mansoni, whereas aquatic snails of the genus Biomphalaria act as intermediate hosts in the parasite life cycle. In Brazil, the distribution of Biomphalaria spp. is closely associated with the occurrence of schistosomiasis. The purpose of this study was to map and predict the spatial distribution of the intermediate host snails of S. mansoni across Brazil. We assembled snail "presence-only" data and used a maximum entropy approach, along with climatic and environmental variables to produce predictive risk maps. We identified a series of risk factors that govern the distribution of Biomphalaria snails. We find that high-risk areas for B. glabrata are concentrated in the regions of Northeast and Southeast and the northern part of the South region. B. straminea are found in the Northeast and Southeast regions, and B. tenagophila are concentrated in the Southeast and South regions. Our findings confirm that the presence of the intermediate host snails is correlated with the occurrence of schistosomiasis mansoni. The generated risk maps of intermediate host snails might assist the national control programme for spatial targeting of control interventions and to ultimately move towards schistosomiasis elimination in Brazil.

AB  - It has long been known that circulating levels of IgG and IgM antibodies are elevated in patients with essential and pregnancy-related hypertension. Recent studies indicate these antibodies target, and in many cases activate, G-protein coupled receptors and ion channels. Prominent among these protein targets are AT(1) receptors, alpha(1) -adrenoceptors, beta(1) -adrenoceptors, and L-type voltage operated Ca (2+) channels, all of which are known to play key roles in the regulation of blood pressure through modulation of vascular tone, cardiac output, and/or Na+/water reabsorption in the kidneys. This suggests that elevated antibody production may be a causal mechanism in at least some cases of hypertension. In this brief review, we will further describe the protein targets of the antibodies that are elevated in individuals with essential and pregnancy-related hypertension and the likely pathophysiological consequences of antibody binding to these targets. We will speculate on the potential mechanisms that underlie elevated antibody levels in hypertensive individuals and, finally, we will outline the therapeutic opportunities that could arise with a better understanding of how and why antibodies are produced in hypertension.

AB  - PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF ANTICHAGASIC BENZNIDAZOLE. Currently, benznidazole (BNZ) is a unique therapeutic alternative available in Brazil to treat Chagas disease. Despite its traditional medical use, little is known about the chemical nature of this drug. A detailed study of the physicochemical properties of BNZ was performed using multiple assays. Thermal, diffractometric, morphological and reological drug profiles were obtained. The partition coefficient and solubility results allowed this drug to be classified as a class IV drug according to the biopharmaceutical classification system. This information will be useful for the development of more effective BNZ formulations and for establishing the quality profile of BNZ.

AB  - Background: Caviomorph rodents, some of the oldest Leishmania spp. hosts, are widely dispersed in Brazil. Despite both experimental and field studies having suggested that these rodents are potential reservoirs of Leishmania parasites, not more than 88 specimens were analyzed in the few studies of natural infection. Our hypothesis was that caviomorph rodents are inserted in the transmission cycles of Leishmania in different regions, more so than is currently recognized.
   Methodology: We investigated the Leishmania infection in spleen fragments of 373 caviomorph rodents from 20 different species collected in five Brazilian biomes in a period of 13 years. PCR reactions targeting kDNA of Leishmania sp. were used to diagnose infection, while Leishmania species identification was performed by DNA sequencing of the amplified products obtained in the HSP70 (234) targeting. Serology by IFAT was performed on the available serum of these rodents.
   Principal findings: In 13 caviomorph rodents, DNA sequencing analyses allowed the identification of 4 species of the subgenus L. (Viannia): L. shawi, L. guyanensis, L. naiffi, and L. braziliensis; and 1 species of the subgenus L. (Leishmania): L. infantum. These include the description of parasite species in areas not previously included in their known distribution: L. shawi in Thrichomys inermis from Northeastern Brazil and L. naiffi in T. fosteri from Western Brazil. From the four other positive rodents, two were positive for HSP70 (234) targeting but did not generate sequences that enabled the species identification, and another two were positive only in kDNA targeting.
   Conclusions/Significance: The infection rate demonstrated by the serology (51.3%) points out that the natural Leishmania infection in caviomorph rodents is much higher than that observed in the molecular diagnosis (4.6%), highlighting that, in terms of the host species responsible for maintaining Leishmania species in the wild, our current knowledge represents only the "tip of the iceberg.''

AB  - After the systematization and re-dimension of the vectorial control in all the Country by 1975, it was considered necessary to have an up-to-date information on the distribution of vectors in Brazil, and differentiate precisely the role of each of the different species on the intra-domiciliary transmission of Chagas disease. For this purpose, sampling regional surveys for regions with non reliable information were performed, as well as, a house by house search for vectors on those areas considered at risk. For this last, 1,942 municipalities from 19 states were searched, as by the political division of the country by 1980, that was taken as a reference in this paper. These activities, that were implemented as part of the routine for intervention, were completed by 1983. Immediately after, this work was also extended for other areas considered targets for infected bugs. Results obtained, allowed to map the endemic area and the area under risk of vectorial transmission all over the country. Even more, with the results obtained it was possible to recognize those five species proved as vectors of the infection, among thirty already identified. These species, in order of importance, were: Triatoma infestans, Panstrongylus megistus, T. brasiliensis, T pseudomaculata and T. sordida. It was possible also to verify the increase in the dispersion of T. infestans, an aloctonous vector captured now in states of the North-east region, where it was not recognized previously. In relation with native species, a clear division of territories among them was found. Furthermore, P. megistus was found with a difuse distribution, but T. brasiliensis and T. pseudomaculata were restricted to the semi-arid Noth-east. The most often captured bug was T. sordida, (mostly around houses) limited to the cerrado area, which is its origin.

AB  - Objectives: To review the prevalence, incidence, and geographic distribution of the major neglected infections of poverty in Europe as a basis for future policy recommendations.
   Methods: We reviewed the literature from 1999 to 2010 for neglected tropical diseases listed by PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases (http://www.plosntds.org/static/scope.action) and the geographic regions and countries of (continental) Europe. Reference lists of identified articles and reviews were also hand searched, as were World Health Organization databases.
   Results: In Eastern Europe, the soil-transmitted helminth infections (especially ascariasis, trichuriasis, and toxocariasis), giardiasis, and toxoplasmosis remain endemic. High incidence rates of selected food-borne helminthiases including trichinellosis, opisthorchiasis, taeniasis, and echinococcosis also occur, while brucellosis and leptospirosis represent important bacterial zoonoses. Turmoil and economic collapse following the war in the Balkans, the fall of Communism, and Europe's recent recession have helped to promote their high prevalence and incidence rates. In Southern Europe, vector-borne zoonoses have emerged, including leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, and key arboviral infections. Additional vulnerable populations include the Roma, orphans destined for international adoption, and some immigrant groups.
   Conclusions: Among the policy recommendations are increased efforts to determine the prevalence, incidence, and geographic distribution of Europe's neglected infections, epidemiological studies to understand the ecology and mechanisms of disease transmission, and research and development for new control tools.

AB  - We present here a multisource approach that takes advantage of several disciplines to address a taxonomic issue. A triatomine related to Rhodnius robustus Larrousse, 1927 was recently found in the state of Rondonia, Brazil. The name Rhodnius montenegrensis n. sp. is suggested because it was found in the municipality of Monte Negro. The main differences between these two species can be detected in the female and male genitalia, but there are also noticeable differences in their eggs. Molecular analysis using PCR-RFLP technique and Bayesian inferences based on a fragment of the Cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene corroborated the morphological findings. We used this integrative approach to address the taxonomic decision for a new Rhodnius species and its relationship with others of this genus. Results obtained herein stress that morphology must be used as the major approach for obtaining phenotypic information, and molecular data should be taken as a complementary tool.

AB  - Sporotrichosis is a mycosis caused by Sporothrix schenckii. The most affected animal is the cat; it has played an important role in the zoonotic transmission of this disease, especially in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, since 1998. In order to evaluate the treatment of feline sporotrichosis with potassium iodide, an observational cohort was conducted in 48 cats with sporotrichosis at Instituto de Pesquisa Clinica Evandro Chagas, Fiocruz. All cats received potassium iodide capsules, 2.5 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg q24h. The cure rate was 47.9%, treatment failure was 37.5%, treatment abandonment was 10.4% and death was 4.2%. Clinical adverse effects were observed in 52.1% of the cases. Thirteen cats had a mild increase in hepatic transaminase levels during the treatment, six of them presented clinical signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity. Compared to previous studies with itraconazole and iodide in saturated solution, potassium iodide capsules are an alternative for feline sporotrichosis treatment.

AB  - Sporotrichosis is caused by Sporothrix schenckii. The cat is the animal species most affected by this mycosis and plays an important role in the zoonotic transmission of this disease. The definitive diagnosis is made by isolation of the fungus in culture; however, cytopathological examination is frequently used in cats. Medical records from cats treated at Instituto de Pesquisa Clinica Evandro Chagas/Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 2004 and 2006 were reviewed. Criteria for inclusion were a diagnosis by isolation of S schenckii in culture and cytopathological examination of the same lesion as that used for collection of the culture material. Eight hundred and six cats were included in the study. Yeast-like structures suggestive of S schenckii were observed in 636 cases. The sensitivity of the method was 78.9%. Its practicality, low cost and sensitivity validate cytopathology as a safe technique for the presumptive diagnosis of sporotrichosis in cats. (C) 2010 ISFM and AAFP. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: For the first time we provide the description of the melanic (dark) morphotype of Rhodnius nasutus and determine the pattern of genetic inheritance for this characteristic. Methods: Dark morph R. nasutus specimens were crossbred with standard (typically patterned) R. nasutus. Results: We present the first occurrence of the melanic morphotype in the genus Rhodnius. The crossbreeding results demonstrate that the inheritance pattern of this characteristic follows Mendel's simple laws of segregation and an independent assortment of alleles. Conclusions: Phenotypic variation of R. nasutus reinforces the heterogeneity found in the Triatominae. Descriptions of new species in this subfamily require rigorous validation criteria.

AB  - It is believed that sigmoid volvulus (SV) in Brazil is a frequent complication of megacolon caused by Chagas' disease (CD), differing in some characteristics from volvulus found in other countries. Bowel obstruction in patients with CD, principally when the cause is SV, may be sometimes difficult to diagnosis exclusively with plain abdominal radiograph. Fecaloma impacted in retossigmoidal area is one of the differential diagnoses. In addition, the huge amount of gas and feces, and distension of the colon normally increase the difficulty to make the correct diagnostic. The use of computer tomography (CT) scan can easy elucidate the picture of SV, and can be a great tool in cases of patients with CD and suspicion of this entity. A 62-year-old man showed bowel distention and stop disposal of gas for 5 days. He had previous diagnosis of CD. He also had been suffering from chronic constipation for several years, including impacted fecaloma, with the necessity of manual extraction. Plain abdominal radiographs showed an important colon dilatation and gross amount of feces in the sigmoid colon. Abdominal computer tomography sacan revealed dilated colon filled with feces, as well, the "whirl sign" composed of mesentery and twisted colon. When abdominal radiograph films reveal gross colonic dilatation of unknown etiology in patients with CD, a whirl sign on CT scans raises the possibility of colonic volvulus.

AB  - The resistance of triatomines to pyrethroids has been reported in several Latin American countries, including Brazil, indicating the need for the development of new approaches for the control of vectors of the Chagas disease. In here, we evaluated the insecticidal potential of the essential oil of Eucalyptus urograndis (Myrtaceae) against unsexed third and fourth instars of Rhodnius neglectus Lent (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in topical application, fumigation, surface contact, and repellency . The insecticidal activity of the essential oil tested was detected by topical application (LD50 = 0.1731 mu L/insect and LD99 = 0.2948 mu L/insect for 24 h), fumigation (LC50 = 0.021 mL/mL air and LC99 = 0.1525 mL/mL air for 24 h) and surface contact (LC50 = 0.7073 mu L/cm(2) and LC99 = 4.59 mu L/cm(2) for 24 h). Mortality observed after 48-72-h exposure was very high and did not allow for any adjustment of the mortality curve. In the repellency assay, an effect was observed on 80% of tested nymphs. However, no repellency was observed after 24 h of exposure. Eucalyptus urograndis essential oil has a high insecticidal and repellent potential for R. neglectus nymphs, whether serving as a molecular model for new substances or as an alternative for the control of these insects.

AB  - Phylogenetic approaches based on mitochondrial DNA variation (fragments of Cyt B and 16S ribosomal RNA) have revealed Triatoma sherlocki as the most recent species addition to the Triatoma brasiliensis species complex; a monophyletic group which includes T. brasiliensis, Triatoma melanica, and Triatoma juazeirensis. T. sherlocki is the most differentiated among all species of this complex: it is unable to fly, possesses longer legs than the other members, and has reddish tonality in some parts of its exochorion. We question whether these species are reproductively compatible because of this pronounced morphological differentiation, and therefore, we present a series of cross breeding experiments that test compatibility between T. sherlocki and other members of the T. brasiliensis complex. We extended our analyses to include crosses between T. sherlocki and Triatoma lend, because the latter has been suggested as a possible member of this complex. T. sherlocki male x T. lend female pairs failed to produce hybrids. All other crosses of T. sherlocki and members of T. brasiliensis species complex, as well as backcrosses, produced viable offspring through the third generation. This study stresses the importance of searching for the features that may isolate members of the T. brasiliensis species complex. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the scientific literature, sporotrichosis has traditionally been associated with agricultural work, since the causative agent is found naturally in the soil. However, cases have been reported recently in an urban area, related to zoonotic transmission. The current study aimed to contribute to knowledge on sporotrichosis in an urban area through an exploratory analysis of its socio-spatial distribution in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 1997 to 2007, identifying the areas with the heaviest transmission. The database from the Health Surveillance Service at the Evandro Chagas Institute for Clinical Research, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, was used to estimate incidence rates and spatial distribution. During the study period, 1,848 cases of sporotrichosis were reported, predominantly in adult women not currently in the labor market. The leading source of infection was wounds caused by domestic cats, which contributed to the spread of sporotrichosis in this urban area. Georeferencing of 1,681 cases showed a transmission belt along the border between the city of Rio de Janeiro and the adjacent municipalities in the Greater Metropolitan Area.

AB  - The phylogenetic relationships among species of Triatoma matogrossensis subcomplex (T. baratai, T. guazu, T. matogrossensis, T. sordida, T vandae, and T. williami) was addressed by using fragments of cytochrome oxidase I (COI), 16S rDNA (16S), and cytochrome b (Cytb) through Bayesian and parsimony analyses. We did not recover a monophyletic T matogrossensis subcomplex, and their members were found clustered in three strongly supported clades, as follows: i) T. jurbergi + T. matogrossensis + T. vandae + T. garciabesi + T. sordida; ii) with T guasayana as the sister group of clade (i); and iii) T. wilhami + T. guazu, however not closely related to the clade formed by the previously mentioned species. The other two endemic species from Central-Western Brazil, T. baratai and T. costalimai, were not recovered with strong clade support as related to other members of this subcomplex. Results call for a further revision in the classification of the subcomplexes within the genus Triatoma.

AB  - Background: When selecting blood donors in transfusion centres, one important problem is to identify, during screening, individuals with infectious diseases that can be transmitted by blood, such as malaria, especially when the parasite densities are very low. This problem is particularly severe in endemic areas, such as the Brazilian Amazon. In the present study, molecular diagnostic (real-time PCR) of Plasmodium vivax was used to identify blood donors infected with malaria parasites.
   Methods: Samples from 595 blood donors were collected in seven haemotherapy centres in northern Brazil located in areas at risk for malaria transmission, and the analyses were performed by real-time PCR with TaqMan probes on 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems, to genotype the mitochondrial DNA region specific to P. vivax. The experiment was designed for hybridization of the cytochrome c oxidase genes of the mitochondrial genome (GenBank GI63022502). The serological data were obtained using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay - ELISA (Anti-HIV, Anti-HTLV I-II; Anti-HVC, HBsAg, Anti-HBc, Chagas disease) and VDRL (Syphilis) from the Blood Bank System of the Haematology and Haemotherapy Centre of Para.
   Results: The assay identified eight individuals in the sample (1.34%) infected with P. vivax at the time of blood donation. This percentage was higher than the altered serological results (reactive or inconclusive) of the prevalence of anti-HIV (0.67%), anti-hepatitis C virus (0.34%), anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (0.67%), anti-human T-lymphotropic virus I/II (1.18%), anti-Chagas disease (0.17%) and syphilis (VDRL) (0.50%), but not higher than anti-hepatitis B core antigen antibodies (4.37%). This result indicates the need to use more sensitive methods of diagnosing malaria in blood banks.
   Conclusion: The real-time PCR with TaqMan probes enabled the identification of P. vivax in a high proportion of clinically healthy donors, highlighting the potential risk for transfusion-transmitted malaria. Additionally, this molecular diagnostic tool can be adopted as a new laboratory screening method in haemotherapy centres, especially in malaria-endemic areas.

AB  - Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a significant public health problem in Brazil and several regions of the world. This study investigated the magnitude, temporal trends and spatial distribution of mortality related to VL in Brazil.
   Methods: We performed a study based on secondary data obtained from the Brazilian Mortality Information System. We included all deaths in Brazil from 2000 to 2011, in which VL was recorded as cause of death. We present epidemiological characteristics, trend analysis of mortality and case fatality rates by joinpoint regression models, and spatial analysis using municipalities as geographical units of analysis.
   Results: In the study period, 12,491,280 deaths were recorded in Brazil. VL was mentioned in 3,322 (0.03%) deaths. Average annual age-adjusted mortality rate was 0.15 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants and case fatality rate 8.1%. Highest mortality rates were observed in males (0.19 deaths/100,000 inhabitants), <1 year-olds (1.03 deaths/100,000 inhabitants) and residents in Northeast region (0.30 deaths/100,000 inhabitants). Highest case fatality rates were observed in males (8.8%), >= 70 year-olds (43.8%) and residents in South region (17.7%). Mortality and case fatality rates showed a significant increase in Brazil over the period, with different patterns between regions: increasing mortality rates in the North (Annual Percent Change - APC: 9.4%; 95% confidence interval - CI: 5.3 to 13.6), and Southeast (APC: 8.1%; 95% CI: 2.6 to 13.9); and increasing case fatality rates in the Northeast (APC: 4.0%; 95% CI: 0.8 to 7.4). Spatial analysis identified a major cluster of high mortality encompassing a wide geographic range in North and Northeast Brazil.
   Conclusions: Despite ongoing control strategies, mortality related to VL in Brazil is increasing. Mortality and case fatality vary considerably between regions, and surveillance and control measures should be prioritized in high-risk clusters. Early diagnosis and treatment are fundamental strategies for reducing case fatality of VL in Brazil.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is one of the most serious worldwide diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus, affecting millions of people around the world. All currently available treatments present severe toxic side effects, require long-term compliance, cause serious side effects and are uncomfortable for patients. Leishmania amazonensis, a species endemic to Brazil, causes severe localised or diffuse skin lesions in humans. Owing to the unsatisfactory nature of the currently available chemotherapies, new approaches have been assessed for improved therapeutic intervention strategies against leishmaniasis. Miltefosine is an alkylphospholipid analogue that exhibits potent activity against the different clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the long-term efficacy of miltefosine in BALB/c mice infected with L. amazonensis owing to the lack of a profound study demonstrating its dose-dependent and long-term effects. It was observed that animals treated with 20-50 mg/kg/day of miltefosine exhibited a significant dose-dependent reduction in lesion size; furthermore, in mice receiving higher doses, lesions disappeared after the end of treatment. To confirm a possible parasitological cure, mice up to 250 days after the end of treatment were analysed. No lesions or presence of parasite DNA were found in mice treated with 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg/day of miltefosine. In summary, these results show that miltefosine may be used to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. amazonensis, alone or as combination therapy.

AB  - Arthropod pests in forest and agricultural systems are affected by many pathogenic organisms. Among them, entomopathogenic fungi are the one most common control agents that regulate their populations. This review compiles the information available from Argentina and Brazil about the entomopathogenic fungi occurring in agricultural and natural environments. The scientific names of the fungi are listed according to the latest phylogenetically based classification of fungi. We present an updated list of arthropod-pathogenic fungi occurring in 15 of the 23 provinces of Argentina and 20 of the 27 states of Brazil based on published literature and our personal observations. The list includes a total of 114 fungal species from 53 genera: of Blastocladiomycetes (2 genera), Entomophthorales (8 genera), Harpellales (13 genera), and a diverse assortment of ascomycetes (primarily from Hypocreales) in 22 anamorphic and 5 teleomorphic genera. In the both countries, molecular studies on arthropod-pathogenic fungi are still in their early stages and have focused primarily on intraspecific variability and adequate generic assignment. This listing seeks to encourage more active collection and characterization of these fungi by both traditional and molecular approaches from the obviously rich but underexplored flora of fungi affecting arthropods throughout this large region of South America.

AB  - In order to investigate the prevalence of chagasic heart disease in Brazil, a national electrocardiographic survey was carried out from 1977 to 1981. A total of 5,347 electrocardiograms (ECG) were performed and paired by age and gender. The results obtained in relation with the autochthonous cases, were distributed by Brazilian states, as follows: Rio Grande do Sul (1,078), Minas Gerais (760), Bahia (612), Parana (400), Paraiba (340), Piaui (218), Sergipe (216), Goias (176), Pernambuco (170), Ceara (136) and Alagoas 134. The higher proportions of altered ECGs among seropositive individuals were found in the States of Goias (63.6%), Minas Gerais (57.6%), Ceara (57.3%), Parana (54.5%), Piaui (53.2%) and Paraiba (52.3%). Among the control individuals, these proportions were respectively 25%, 25.7%, 25%, 12.5%, 22.9% and 26.5%. A significant statistical difference of altered ECGs between positive and negative individuals was verified in all the States, with a single exception (Alagoas). The estimation of the gradient showed to be higher in Parana State (42%), followed by Goias (38.6%), Ceara (32.3%), Minas Gerais (31.9%), Piaui (30.3%), Paraiba (25.8%), Pernambuco (22.3%), Bahia (18.9%), Sergipe (16.7%), Rio Grande do Sul (9.9%) and Alagoas (7.5%). Concerning the distribution of the electrocardiographical alterations found in the eleven states, the main alterations find among the seropositive group were: ventricular extrasystoles, complete right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, the association of complete right bundle branch block with left anterior fascicular block and primary alterations of the ST segment and of the T wave. Furthermore, these ECG alterations were more prevalent in the group of infected individuals.

AB  - Schistosomiasis is an infectious parasitic disease caused by helminths from the genus Schistosoma; it affects over 200 million people globally and is endemic in 70 countries. In Brazil, 6 million individuals are infected with Schistosoma mansoni. Furthermore, as the prevalence of S. mansoni infections is increasing, approximately 26 million citizens in 19 Brazilian states are at risk for infection. Schistosomiasis disease control involves predominately the administration of a single drug, praziquantel. Although praziquantel exhibits chemotherapeutic efficacy and safety, its massive use in endemic zones, the possibility of the emergence of drug-resistant Schistosoma parasites, and the lack of another efficacious antischistosomal drug demand the discovery of new schistosomicidal compounds. First developed as anti-tumor drug, miltefosine is an alkylphospholipid derivative that exhibits bioactivity against Leishmania and Trypanosoma parasites, free-living protozoa, bacteria, and fungi. With its anti-parasite activity, miltefosine was the first orally administered drug against visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis approved. Previously, by means of the MTT cytotoxic assay and a DNA fragmentation test, we verified that, at doses of 100 and 200 mu M (40 and 80 mu g/mL), miltefosine exhibited in vitro schistosomicidal activity against adult S. mansoni worms. Here, we present ultrastructural evidence of rapid, severe miltefosine-induced surface membrane damage in S. mansoni following drug treatment. The number of dead parasites was concentration- and time-dependent following miltefosine treatment. At a miltefosine concentration of 200 mu M (similar to 80 mu g/mL), in vitro parasite killing was initiated as early as 3 h post-incubation, and it was maximal after 24 h of treatment. The parasite death was preceded by progressive surface membrane damage, characterized by tegument peeling, spine reduction and erosion, blister formation and rupture, and the emergence of holes. According to our present results, miltefosine is very effective at inducing membrane destruction of S. mansoni with a short onset of pharmacological action.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the prevalence of serological markers for HIV-1/2, HBV, HCV, Treponema cruzi and T. pallidum infections. The association of these infections with risk factors in a population from Salvador, Bahia, Brazil was also analysed. Of the 780 enrolled individuals, 545 (70%) were female and 235 (30%) were male. Seroprevalence of 0.8% (6/702), 1.3% (9/678), 1.5% (10/684), 3.5% (23/663) and 11.5% (77/668) for HIV-1/2, HBV, HCV, T. cruzi and T. pallidum infections, respectively, was observed. The seroprevalence of T. pallidum was higher in males 20% (43/210) than in females 7% (34/458) (P<0.01). An association between age and seroprevalence for T. cruzi (P=0.02) and T. pallidum (P<0.01) was observed. HBsAg was associated with having tattoos (3/37 vs. 6/623, P=0.01) and not having a steady sexual partner (5/141 vs. 4/473, P=0.04), while anti-HIV-1/2 was associated with having tattoos (2/39 vs. 4/647, P=0.04); however, larger studies are needed to categorically state the relationship of these risk factors with infectious agents. The prevalence of serological markers for HIV-1/2, HBV, HCV and T. cruzi was consistent with other studies.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The role of Azadirachta indica (neem) against Chagas disease and its antibiotic and antidiabetic action have been demonstrated in non-pregnant animals. However, the effects of neem on lipid metabolism and oxidative stress during pregnancy remain to be investigated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Azadirachta indica (neem) on maternal reproductive performance and biochemical parameters in non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced mild diabetic rats (MD).
   Materials and methods: Pregnant rats were randomly distributed into six experimental groups: ND=non-treated non-diabetic (n=13); NDOil=non-diabetic treated with 1.2 mL/day neem seed oil (n=12); NDPA=non-diabetic treated with 1.0 mg/mL/day azadirachtin (n=12); D=non-treated diabetic (n=13); DOil: diabetic treated with neem seed oil (n=12), and DPA=diabetic treated with azadirachtin, n=13. Treatment with either neem oil (1.2 mL/day) or azadirachtin (1.0 mg/mL/day) was orally administered throughout pregnancy. Glucose test tolerance (GTT) was performed at day 17 of pregnancy and used as an inclusion criterion. At term pregnancy, maternal reproductive outcomes, lipid profile and oxidative stress status were assessed.
   Results: Treatment with neem oil and azadirachtin during pregnancy (1) had no hypoglycemic and anti-hyperglycemic effects on non-diabetic and diabetic rats, respectively; (2) affected OGTT glycemic levels in diabetic rats; (3) increased the proportion of fetuses classified as small for pregnancy age (SPA) in all groups; and (4) did not interfere with the lipid profile in non-diabetic dams. Neem oil reduced the rate of total cholesterol and NEFA in diabetic animals. Both neem oil and azadirachtin increased lipoperoxidation, characterized by increased MDA levels in non-diabetic rats.
   Conclusion: Both neem seed oil and azadirachtin impaired intrauterine development and altered antioxidant/oxidative status during pregnancy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: A sero-epidemiological survey was undertaken to detect the circulation of arboviruses in free-living non-human primates. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 16 non-human primates (13 Sapajus spp. and three Alouatta caraya) that were captured using terrestrial traps and anesthetic darts in woodland regions in the municipalities of Campo Grande, Aquidauana, Jardim, Miranda and Corumba in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The samples were sent to the Instituto Evandro Chagas (IEC) in Ananindeua, Para, Brazil, to detect antibodies against 19 species of arboviruses using a hemagglutination inhibition test (HI). Results: Of the 16 primates investigated in the present study, five (31.2%) were serologically positive for an arbovirus. Of these five, two (12.5%) exhibited antibodies to the Flavivirus genus, one (6.2%) exhibited a monotypic reaction to Cacipacore virus, one (6.2%) was associated with Mayaro virus, and one (6.2%) was positive for Oropouche virus. Conclusions: Based on the positive serology observed in the present study, it was possible to conclude that arboviruses circulate among free-living primates. The viruses in the areas studied might have been introduced by infected humans or by primates from endemic or enzootic areas. Studies of this nature, as well as efficient and continuous surveillance programs, are needed to monitor viral activities in endemic and enzootic regions.

AB  - Flight dispersion is recognized as one of the most important mechanisms for triatomine house infestation. Triatoma sherlocki and T. juazeirensis are closely related species that occur within the same ecotope and their possible reproductive boundaries are unknown. T. sherlocki has shorter wings than T. juazeirensis: a characteristic that possibly implies in reduced flight dispersion, however, this species has been found to invade and colonize homes in Bahia, Brazil. Here, we tested the flight potential of T. sherlocki, compared to that of T. juazeirensis and laboratory-bred hybrids. insects were kept in an apparatus designed to distinguish flyers from nonflyers. Fifty-one and 53% of T. juazeirensis and hybrids were flyers respectively, whereas no T. sherlocki were recorded to fly. Morphometric analysis of the main structures associated with the locomotor abilities showed that hybrids exhibited intermediate size for most of characters. The width of pronotum of both hybrids and T. juazeirensis was significantly larger than T. sherlocki. We suggested that lack of flight ability of T. sherlocki is possibly a result of reduced wing size and distinct shape, combined with undeveloped flight muscles in a shorter thoracic box. The mobility of T. sherlocki might be compensated by its significantly longer legs, and may possibly increase its ability to invade human dwellings by active dispersion. What is more, this study showed that hybrids between T. sherloki and T. juazeirensis have intermediate morphological characters that may give them higher fitness than their parents, and thus may advance the process of house infestation by either fight or walking in case of an eventual natural hybridization.

AB  - The objective of the study was to evaluate the hygienic conditions and practices of commercial foods of plant origin in establishments and street marketed by street vendors in cities in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Forty different sales points were evaluated (establishments that prepared and sold fruit juices and street vendors that commercialized fresh coconut water, sugarcane juice and orange juice) using a questionnaire with 12 items, divided into three blocks (salesmen/handlers, operations, installations). The results indicated that the activities related to the commerce of fruit beverages in the cities of Sao Goncalo and Rio de Janeiro required the elaboration of a set of actions by the Sanitary Vigilance Agency in order to improve the hygienic and sanitary level and minimize health risk to consumers. Important requirements in the legislation relevant to this type of food are still not followed; adequate packaging and storage of the raw material, obtaining the raw material from registered suppliers, hygiene of the handlers and adequate management of wastes produced during the activities in question are amongst the main items deserving attention.

AB  - In Northeastern Brazil visceral leishmaniasis is endemic with lethal cases among humans and dogs. Treatment is toxic and 5-10% of humans die despite treatment. The aim of this work was to survey natural active compounds to find new molecules with high activity and low toxicity against Leishmania infantum chagasi. The compounds thymol and eugenol were chosen to be starting compounds to synthesize acetyl and benzoyl derivatives and to test their antileishmanial activity in vitro and in vivo against L. i. chagasi. A screening assay using luciferase-expressing promastigotes was used to measure the growth inhibition of promastigotes, and an ELISA in situ was performed to evaluate the growth inhibition of amastigote. For the in vivo assay, thymol and eugenol derivatives were given IP to BALB/c mice at 100 mg/kg/day for 30 days. The thymol derivatives demonstrated the greater activity than the eugenol derivatives, and benzoyl-thymol was the best inhibitor (8.67 +/- 0.28 mu g/mL). All compounds demonstrated similar activity against amastigotes, and acetyl-thymol was more active than thymol and the positive control drug amphotericin B. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of Leishmania amastigote only in the spleen but not the liver of mice treated with acetyl-thymol. Thus, these synthesized derivatives demonstrated anti-leishmanial activity both in vitro and in vivo. These may constitute useful compounds to generate new agents for treatment of leishmaniasis.

AB  - Schistosomiasis is an important public health problem, with high morbidity and mortality in endemic countries. We analysed the epidemiological characteristics and time trends of schistosomiasis-related mortality in Brazil. We performed a nationwide study based on official mortality data obtained from the Brazilian Mortality Information System. We included all deaths in Brazil between 2000 and 2011, in which schistosomiasis was mentioned on the death certificate as an underlying or associated cause of death (multiple causes of death). We calculated crude and age-adjusted mortality rates (per 100,000 inhabitants), and proportional mortality rates. Trends over time were assessed using joinpoint regression models. Over the 12-year study period, 12,491,280 deaths were recorded in Brazil. Schistosomiasis was mentioned in 8,756 deaths, including in 6,319 (72.2%) as an underlying cause and in 2,437 (27.8%) as an associated cause. The average annual age-adjusted mortality rate was 0.49 deaths/100,000 inhabitants (95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.52) and proportional mortality rate was 0.070% (95% confidence interval: 0.069-0.072). Males (0.53 deaths/100,000 inhabitants), those aged >= 70 years (3.41 deaths/100,000 inhabitants), those of brown race/colour (0.44 deaths/100,000 inhabitants), and residents in the Northeast region of Brazil (1.19 deaths/100,000 inhabitants) had the highest schistosomiasis-related death rates. Age-adjusted mortality rates showed a significant decrease at a national level (Annual Percent Change: -2.8%; 95% confidence interval: -4.2 to -2.4) during the studied period. We observed decreasing mortality rates in the Northeast (Annual Percent Change: -2.5%; 95% confidence interval: -4.2 to -0.8), Southeast (Annual Percent Change: -2.2%; 95% confidence interval: -3.6 to -0.9), and Central-West (Annual Percent Change: -7.9%; 95% confidence interval: -11.3 to -4.3) regions, while the rates remained stable in the North and South regions. Despite the reduced mortality, schistosomiasis is still a neglected cause of death in Brazil, with considerable regional differences. Sustainable control measures should focus on increased coverage, and intensified and tailored control measures, to prevent the occurrence of severe forms of schistosomiasis and associated deaths.

AB  - Introduction: Leishmaniasis is an infectious and parasitic zoonotic, non-contagious, vector-borne disease caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania. In Brazil, the major vector of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi (Cunha & Chagas, 1934) is Lutzomyia longipalpis. Barra do Garcas, State of Mato Grosso, was designated as a priority area by the Brazilian Ministry of Health for american visceral leishmaniasis, and it is important to identify the vector species present in this municipality. Our objective was to raise sandflies and study the influence of environmental variables on the vector density of Lutzomyia longipalpis. Methods: We performed entomological monitoring in 3 districts using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps and recorded human cases of american visceral leishmaniasis in the city. We calculated the relative frequency and richness of sandflies and applied a transfer function model to the vector density correlate with relative humidity. Results: The sandfly population was composed of 2 genera and 27 species, totaling 8,097 individuals. Monitoring identified Lutzomyia longipalpis (44%), followed by Lutzomyia lenti (18.9%), Lutzomyia whitmani (13.9%), Lutzomyia carmelinoi (9.1%), Lutzomyia evandroi (5.1%), Lutzomyia termitophila (3.3%), Lutzomyia sordellii (1.9%), and 20 other species (<4%). The male: female ratio was 3.5:1. We observed high species diversity (Da = 6.65). Lutzomyia longipalpis showed occurrence peaks during the rainy season; there was a temporal correlation with humidity, but not with frequency or temperature. Conclusions: The presence of Lutzomyia longipalpis in the urban area of Barra do Garcas underscores the changing disease profile, which was previously restricted to the wild environment.

AB  - The male accessory glands in Triatoma are tubular and produce substances with some functions related to production of the spermatophore. In the current study, the cytochemistry of male accessory glands was evaluated in starved Triatoma brasiliensis and adult Triatoma melanica. The storage of carbohydrates and proteins in T. melanica male accessory glands occurs earlier than in T. brasiliensis. In addition, the occurrence of eletron-lucent granules without carbohydrates and proteins suggests that other substances are released by these glands, which may be used for lubrication of the male genitalia. Male T. brasiliensis has more intense secretory activity in the fifth day of adult life, which may indicate a higher reproductive capacity. The analysis of lipid production in male accessory glands can contribute to the knowledge of spermatophore formation in these species.

AB  - Brazilian red propolis was administered orally to Santa Ins ewes, and evaluation was made of general health and hematological, biochemical, and parasitic responses during and after flushing. Thirty mature, nonlactating, nonpregnant Santa Ins ewes (40 +/- 2 kg and 2.5 years old) were grazing tropical pasture (Brachiaria decumbens and Pennisetum purpureum) and, as flushing after synchronization, were supplemented with a concentrate-roughage mixture at a rate of 4 % body weight (BW). Ewes were divided according to BW and fecal egg count (FEC) into two groups (n = 15 each): control and propolis that received propolis ethanolic extract at rates of, respectively, 0 and 3 g/ewe/day. The treatments lasted 21 days until the end of flushing period. BW and body condition score (BCS) were recorded, and blood and fecal samples were taken weekly for 8 weeks. Mean values of BW and BCS were not (P > 0.05) affected by propolis administration. Propolis increased (P < 0.01) total leukocytes (WBC), but no significant differences were observed for other hematological parameters. Propolis increased (P < 0.01) total protein and globulin concentrations and decreased (P < 0.01) triglycerides, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamate pyruvate transaminase. Propolis decreased (P < 0.05) FEC. Propolis administration had good impact on ewe health and may be a promising feed additive during critical periods such as flushing.

AB  - This study analyzed the importance of zoonoses and communicable diseases common to man and animals as potential Public Health Emergencies of International Concern to build an evidence base for future efforts to reduce risk of infection at the animal/human health interface. The events recorded in the World Health Organization (WHO) Event Management System (EMS) database for the Americas during the 18 months since the implementation of the 2005 revised version of WHO's International Health Regulations (15 June 2007-31 December 2008) were the main source for this analysis. Of the 110 events recorded by the EMS for the Americas during the study period, 86 were classified as communicable diseases-77 (70.0%) "within the animal/human health interface," 9 (8.2%) "not common to man and animals," 16 (14.5%) "syndromes with unknown etiologies," and 8 (7.3%) "product- related/other." Of the 77 events within the animal/human health interface, 48 were "substantiated" (the presence of hazard was confirmed and/or human cases occurred clearly in excess of normal expectancy). These results confirm previous research and underscore the importance of the animal/human health interface as well as inter-sectoral collaboration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To evaluate the frequency and clinical features of endemic and other opportunistic infections in liver or kidney transplant recipients in four transplant centres in different geographical areas of Brazil.
   METHODS Retrospective analysis of medical and laboratory records of four transplant centres on endemic and other opportunistic infections in liver or kidney transplant recipients. Analyses were performed with spss statistical software.
   RESULTS From 2001 to 2006, 1046 kidney and 708 liver transplants were registered in all centres. The average age was 42 years. Among 82 (4.7%) cases with infections, the most frequent was tuberculosis (2.0%), followed by systemic protozoal infections (0.7%), toxoplasmosis (0.4%) and visceral leishmaniasis (0.3%). Systemic fungal infections occurred in 0.6%, of which 0.4% were cryptococcosis and 0.2% were histoplasmosis. Dengue was the only systemic viral infection and was registered in two cases (0.1%), of which one was classified as the classic form and the other as dengue haemorrhagic fever. Nocardiosis was described in one case (0.05%). The infectious agents most frequently associated with diarrhoea were Blastocystis sp., Schistosoma mansoni and Strongyloides stercoralis.
   CONCLUSIONS Opportunistic Infections in transplant patients have a wide spectrum and may vary from asymptomatic to severe infections with high mortality. A better understanding of the epidemiology of endemic pathogens and clinical manifestations can contribute to the establishment of an early diagnosis as well as correct treatment aimed at decreasing morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Canine visceral leishmaniasis is an important public health concern. In the epidemiological context of human visceral leishmaniasis, dogs are considered the main reservoir of Leishmania parasites; therefore, dogs must be epidemiologically monitored constantly in endemic areas. Furthermore, dog to human transmission has been correlated with emerging urbanization and increasing rates of leishmaniasis infection worldwide. Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum (L chagasi) is the etiologic agent of visceral leishmaniasis in the New World. In this work, a new L (14 infantum (L chagasi) recombinant antigen, named ATP diphosphohydrolase (rLic-NTPDase-2), intended for use in the immunodiagnosis of CVL was produced and validated. The extracellular domain of ATP diphosphohydrolase was cloned and expressed in the pET21b-Escherichia coli expression system. Indirect ELISA assays were used to detect the purified rLic-NTPDase-2 antigen using a standard canine sera library. This library contained CVL-positive samples, leishmaniasis-negative samples and samples from Trypanosoma cruzi-infected dogs. The results show a high sensitivity of 100% (95% CI = 92.60-100.0%) and a high specificity of 100% (95% CI = 86.77-100.0%), with a high degree of confidence (k = 1). These findings demonstrate the potential use of this recombinant protein in immune diagnosis of canine leishmaniasis and open the possibility of its application to other diagnostic approaches, such as immunochromatography fast lateral flow assays and human leishmaniasis diagnosis.

AB  - Background: Visceral Leishmaniasis is endemic to Brazil, where it is caused by Leishmania infantum (syn. Leishmania chagasi). Following parasite inoculation, individuals may experience asymptomatic infection, raising the possibility of parasite transmission through the transfusion of contaminated blood products. In the present work, we evaluated the prevalence of asymptomatic Leishmania infection among blood donors in Salvador, northeastern Brazil.
   Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from 700 blood donors attending the Blood Bank of Bahia (HEMOBA/SESAB), from January to September 2010. We evaluated anti-Leishmania serology by ELISA, employing Soluble Leishmania Antigen (sensitivity 90% and specificity 95%). The presence of parasite DNA was determined by qPCR, targeting a single copy gene (G6PD), and by end-point PCR, targeting multiple targets, namely a segment located in the Leishmania rRNA locus (ITS) and the conserved region of kinetoplastid DNA (kDNA) minicircles.
   Results: The blood-donor population was comprised of 74.5% of males with a mean age of 34 years. Anti-Leishmania serology by ELISA was positive in 5.4% (38/700) individuals. One individual was also positive for Chagas' disease and another tested positive for Syphilis. Employing qPCR, parasite DNA was not found in any of 38 seropositive samples. However, by ITS PCR, 8/38 (21%) samples were positive and this positivity increased to 26/38 (68%) when we targeted kDNA amplification. Agreement between both techniques (ITS and kDNA PCR) was fair (kappa = 0.219).
   Conclusions: These results indicate that asymptomatic infection is present among the blood donor population of Salvador, a finding that warrants a broader discussion regarding the need to implement specific screening strategies.

AB  - Toxoplasma (T.) gondii is known to infect various cell types including macrophages. In the present study, we generated monocyte-derived macrophage cultures from chicken blood. By flow cytometrical analysis, 84.5 % of the cultivated cells showed typical macrophage properties. Macrophage cultures were cultivated at either 37 A degrees C or 40 A degrees C, respectively, and were infected 72 to 96 h post isolationem with tachyzoites of the T. gondii type II strain ME49 at a rate of 7.5 tachyzoites per host cell. Light microscopical investigations revealed incorporation of tachyzoites into the macrophages and gradual destruction of the infected macrophage culture. Parasite multiplication was observed by a quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) based on the 529-bp fragment specific for T. gondii. Samples were drawn 1 h post infectionem (p.i.), as well as 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h p.i. The parasite replication curve showed a transient decrease of parasite stages 12 h p.i. followed by a tachyzoite multiplication. The comparison of different culture conditions showed a significantly higher replication rate of T. gondii at 37 A degrees C (median value 48 h p.i., 289.2 % of the initial tachyzoite number) compared to cultures incubated at 40 A degrees C (median value 48 h p.i., 73.1 % of the initial tachyzoite number) throughout the observation period (P < 0.05). In general, replication rates were significantly lower than in a standard VERO cell cultures at 37 A degrees C (P < 0.05). The observed differences were attributed to the physiological chicken macrophage reaction at 40 A degrees C probably approximating the situation in vivo.

AB  - Background The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is better than antiarrhythmic drug therapy for the primary and secondary prevention of all-cause mortality and sudden cardiac death in patients with either coronary artery disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. This study aims to assess whether the ICD also has this effect for primary prevention in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC).
   Methods In this randomized (concealed allocation) open-label trial, we aim to enroll up to 1,100 patients with CCC, a Rassi risk score for death prediction of >= 10 points, and at least 1 episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia on a 24-hour Holter monitoring. Patients from 28 centers in Brazil will be randomly assigned in a 1: 1 ratio to receive an ICD or amiodarone (600 mg/d for 10 days, then 200-400 mg/d until the end of the study). The randomization sequence will be generated by computer, and the members of the committees responsible for end point validation and data analysis will be blinded to study assignment. The primary end point is all-cause death, and enrolment will continue until 256 patients have reached this end point. Key secondary end points include cardiovascular death, sudden cardiac death, hospitalization for heart failure, and quality of life. We expect follow-up to last 3 to 6 years, and data analysis will be done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01722942.
   Conclusion CHAGASICS is the first large-scale trial to assess the benefit of ICD therapy for the primary prevention of death in patients with CCC and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, who have a moderate to high risk of death.

AB  - Objective: To determine the extent of population movement after diagnosis with leprosy and to describe the underlying motives and determinants for relocation.
   Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted among those newly diagnosed with leprosy in 79 endemic municipalities in the state of Tocantins, central Brazil. Individuals were identified through the National Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN) database and interviewed with structured questionnaires.
   Results: In total, 224(20.9%) out of 1070 individuals relocated after their diagnosis with leprosy. Respondents moved to another neighbourhood in the same municipality (n = 178, 79.5%), followed by another municipality in Tocantins state (n = 26, 11.6%) and in another state (n = 11, 4.9%). The primary motives and/or determinants for relocation were: home ownership (n = 55, 28.4%), familial reasons (n = 43, 19.2%), to seek better living conditions (n = 27, 13.9%), employment (n = 26, 11.6%), and better neighbourhood (n = 22, 9.8%). Other motives were related to better access to leprosy diagnosis/treatment (n = 11, 4.9%), owner-terminated rental (n = 5, 2.2%), personal finances/could not afford housing (n = 4, 1.8%). Perceived stigma due to leprosy was mentioned by one participant (0.5%).
   Conclusion: In Tocantins state, population movement is lower among individuals recently diagnosed with leprosy, as compared to the overall population. The primary motives for relocation after leprosy diagnosis were related to lifestyle changes. Stigma and treatment-related reasons did not appear to be common motives for population movement. These results may reflect policy changes instituted from the Brazilian Program of Leprosy Control to decentralise leprosy services and intensify health education campaigns within a broader concept of Information, Education and Communication.

AB  - Byrsonima verbascifolia, popularly known in Brazil as murici, is a medicinal plant widely used in the treatment of bacterial and viral infections, Chagas's disease, diarrhea, bronchitis, cough and fever, as well as for protection of the intestinal mucosa. Since chemotherapy and radiotherapy, broadly employed in the treatment of cancer, can have undesirable side effects, such as inducing DNA damage in normal cells, it would be useful to investigate compounds that inhibit or reduce these effects. A lyophilized water extract of murici, used at three different concentrations (25, 50, and 100 mg/mL), was tested to determine if it could reduce damage induced by the antineoplastic compound doxorubicin in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster, analyzed by SMART/wing. The frequency of mutant spots in descendants from standard and high bioactivation crosses was significantly reduced by treatment with murici extract. Further studies are needed using other experimental models, to determine if murici has the potential to be employed by cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to identify mosquito fauna and to evaluate whether different light bulb colors influence the attraction of light traps in the Guapiacu Ecological Reserve. Samples were obtained monthly during the period of February, 2012 to January, 2013. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light traps with incandescent light bulbs and LED (ultraviolet, blue, green, and red) bulbs were utilized. In total, 8,170 specimens were captured, including 59 species. The presence of Anopheles nimbus (Theobald 1902) and Orthopodomyia fascipes Coquillet 1906 were recorded for the first time in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The green LED trap attracted the highest number of specimens and presented the highest diversity and mosquito average. The blue and green LED traps attracted the highest number of species. However, the differences between lights were not significant. The most common species were Coquillettidia juxtamansonia (Chagas 1907), Culex declarator Dyar and Knab 1906, and Culex ribeirensis Forattini and Sallum 1985.

AB  - A near-threatened species, the maned wolf's (Chrysocyon brachyurus) range extends from central Brazil, northern and eastern Bolivia, and southeastern Peru to the southeast of the Gran Chaco ecoregion and adjacent scrubland in Argentina. Rural domestic dogs under ownership may pose threats to maned wolves as reservoir hosts of multiple pathogens. A serologic survey of rural domestic dogs and maned wolves was conducted to document exposure to canine pathogens in southeastern Santiago del Estero, Argentina, with a parallel questionnaire of knowledge, attitudes, and perception of local villagers in relation to maned wolves. The three maned wolves examined had evidence of exposure to canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, Leptospira interrogans spp., and Dirofilaria immitis. Dogs had very high seroprevalence for Neospora caninum and canine coronavirus (67%), canine adenovirus (59%), D. immitis (58%), canine distemper virus (57%), Toxoplasma gondii (33%), and L. interrogans spp. (20%). Antibodies for canine parvovirus, Brucella canis and Trypanosoma cruzi were rare or absent. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that dog seroprevalence was not significantly associated with age, sex, and function for any of the pathogens investigated. The frequency distribution of seroreactivity to specific pathogens per dog was highly aggregated. Villagers considered that illegal trade, hunting, vehicular collisions, and interactions with dogs were the most serious local threats for maned wolves. The multiple threats faced by the maned wolf populations in southeastern Santiago del Estero suggest that their populations are unlikely to remain viable unless specific protection measures are taken.

AB  - Background: Offspring of women with schistosomiasis may exhibit immune responsiveness to schistosomes due to in utero sensitisation or trans-placental transfer of antibodies. Praziquantel treatment during pregnancy boosts maternal immune responses to schistosome antigens and reduces worm burden. Effects of praziquantel treatment during pregnancy on responses among offspring are unknown.
   Methods: In a trial of anthelminthic treatment during pregnancy in Uganda (ISRCTN32849447; http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN32849447/elliott), offspring of women with Schistosoma mansoni were examined for cytokine and antibody responses to schistosome worm (SWA) and egg (SEA) antigen, in cord blood and at age one year. Relationships to maternal responses and pre-treatment infection intensities were examined, and responses were compared between the offspring of women who did, or did not receive praziquantel treatment during pregnancy.
   Results: Of 388 S. mansoni-infected women studied, samples were obtained at age one year from 215 of their infants. Stool examination for S. mansoni eggs was negative for all infants. Cord and infant samples were characterised by very low cytokine production in response to schistosome antigens with the exception of cord IL-10 responses, which were substantial. Cord and infant cytokine responses showed no association with maternal responses. As expected, cord blood levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G to SWA and SEA were high and correlated with maternal antibodies. However, by age one year IgG levels had waned and were hardly detectable. Praziquantel treatment during pregnancy showed no effect on cytokine responses or antibodies levels to SWA or SEA either in cord blood or at age one year, except for IgG1 to SWA, which was elevated in infants of treated mothers, reflecting maternal levels. There was some evidence that maternal infection intensity was positively associated with cord blood IL-5 and IL-13 responses to SWA, and IL-5 responses to SEA, and that this association was modified by treatment with praziquantel.
   Conclusions: Despite strong effects on maternal infection intensity and maternal immune responses, praziquantel treatment of infected women during pregnancy had no effect on anti-schistosome immune responses among offspring by age one year. Whether the treatment will impact upon the offspring's responses on exposure to primary schistosome infection remains to be elucidated.

AB  - Autoimmunity against laminins has been described in several autoimmune diseases (including mucous membrane pemphigoid, anti laminin gamma 1 pemphigoid, and connective tissue diseases), in pregnancy loss, and in infections such as Chagas disease. Except for anti Laminin-332 mucous membrane pemphigoid, adequate evidence has been lacking for the tissue injury potential of laminin-specific antibodies and the pathogenic epitopes. We evaluated the pathogenic potential of antibodies targeting Laminin gamma 1, a major constituent of basement membranes and the main antigen in anti Laminin gamma 1 pemphigoid. Rabbit antibodies were generated against fragments of the N-terminus and C-terminus of murine laminin gamma 1, and their ability to disrupt Ligand interactions and/or to activate complement and granulocytes was assessed using previously established ex vivo assays. Our findings document a pathogenic potential of antibodies targeting the laminin gamma 1 N-terminus. These antibodies interfere with the binding of nidogen to Laminin and can activate granulocytes and the complement cascade. We detected antibodies with different degrees of reactivity with laminin gamma 1 N-terminus in patients with anti Laminin gamma 1 pemphigoid, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and scleroderma. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the tissue damage associated with Laminin autoimmunity and could facilitate development of appropriate diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies.

AB  - The high prevalence neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) exhibit a global disease burden that exceeds malaria, tuberculosis, and other better known global health conditions: they also represent a potent force in trapping the world's poorest people in poverty. Through extremely low cost national programs of disease mapping and mass drug administration (MDA) for the seven most common NTDs, integrated NTD control and elimination efforts are now in place in more than 14 countries through the support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the British Department for International Development (DFID), and the Global Network for NTDs and its partners. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 2008 some 670 million people in 75 countries received NTD treatments through these and other sponsored programs. With continued successes the next decade could witness the global elimination of blinding trachoma, human Africa trypanosomiasis (HAT), lymphatic filariasis (LF), onchocerciasis, trachoma, and leprosy as public health problems, in addition to the eradication of dracunculiasis. For other high prevalence NTDs, including hookworm infection, schistosomiasis. Chagas disease and leishmaniasis, new drugs and vaccines may still be required. Increasingly it is recognized that the high prevalence NTDs exhibit extensive geographic overlap and polyparasitism is commonly found throughout the world's low income countries. Therefore, global elimination will also require integrated packages of drugs together with vaccine-linked chemotherapy. Ultimately, the global elimination of the high prevalence NTDs will require continued large-scale support from the U.S. Government and selected European governments, however, the emerging market economies, such as Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Nigeria, and wealthy countries in the Middle East will also have to substantially contribute.

AB  - Background: Late presentation to HIV clinical care increases individual risk for (multiple) clinical events and death, and decreases successful response to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In Brazil, provision of HAART free of charge to all individuals infected with HIV could lead to increased testing and linkage to care.
   Methods: We assessed the immune status of 2555 patients who newly presented for HIV clinical care between 1997 and 2009 at the Johns Hopkins Clinical Cohort, in Baltimore, Md, and at the Instituto de Pesquisa Clinica Evandro Chagas Clinical Cohort, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The mean change in the CD4 cell count per year was estimated using multivariate linear regression models.
   Results: Overall, from 1997 to 2009, 56% and 54% of the patients presented for HIV clinical care with CD4 count <= 350 cells per cubic millimeter in Baltimore and Rio de Janeiro, respectively. On average, 75% of the patients presented with viral load >10,000 copies per millimeter. In Rio de Janeiro only, the overall adjusted per year increase in the mean CD4 cell count was statistically significant (5 cells/mm(3), 95% confidence interval: 1 to 10 cells/mm(3)).
   Conclusions : We found that, over years, the majority of patients presented late, that is, with a CD4 count <350 cells per cubic millimeter. Our findings indicate that, despite the availability of HAART for more than a decade, and mass media campaigns stimulating HIV testing in both countries, the proportion of patients who start therapy at an advanced stage of the disease is still high.

AB  - Background: Reliable information on severe morbidity is essential for identifying priorities for case management and to guide resource allocation within the health sector.
   Methods: This study describes overall, AIDS-and non-AIDS-related severe morbidity as well as mortality and its determinants in an urban cohort of HIV-infected individuals from a public healthcare institution, the Evandro Chagas Research Institute (IPEC) of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Severe morbid events were defined as all clinical diagnoses listed in hospitalization discharge records; all diagnoses were checked and validated. Generalized estimating equation models were used to estimate incidence rates while adjusting for within-subject correlation.
   Results: Between 2000 and 2010, 3,537 patients were followed for a total of 16,960 person-years (PY) of follow-up. Over the years, annual incidence rate of severe morbid events, AIDS-related events, non-AIDS-related events, and deaths significantly decreased from, respectively, 36.6, 12.9, 23.7 and 3.2 per 100 PY in 2000 to 25.3, 7.9, 17.4 and 1.9 per 100 PY in 2010. Patients' immunological profiles significantly improved with time; 84% of the patients used combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) per year. Immunodeficiency was associated with a higher incidence rate of AIDS-and non-AIDS-related events as well as with the incidence rate of specific non-AIDS events (bacterial infections, toxicities, cardiovascular, renal and respiratory diseases).
   Conclusions: Our results show that in a middle income country with access to cART, non-AIDS-related events represent an important cause of severe morbidity alongside a still high incidence rate of AIDS-related events.

AB  - This work evaluated the occurrence and genetic structure of Rhodnius nasutus sampled in two sites using morphometry and microsatellites. These sites, presented distinct abiotic features and palm trees: (i) nine Attalea speciosa palm trees, so called babacu, were sampled from the Meruoca Mountain Ridge, a sloping region of reminiscent forest in the state of Ceara, Brazil, and (ii) 17 Copernicia prunifera palm trees, so called carnauba, were sampled in the scrub savanna region (Sobral district) that surrounds the mountain ridge. Of the twenty-six palm trees dissected, 70.6% of carnauba and 88.9% of babacu were infested by R. nasutus. The micro-climatic data where R. nasutus were sheltered demonstrated that the babacu and carnauba palm trees presented significant differences (p < 0.05) in relation to the external environment, except for temperature and relative humidity regulation, suggesting that the architecture of the babacu crown keeps a more stable micro-environment. The morphometric studies of the F1 generation demonstrated that insects from the babacu (A. speciosa) were significantly larger (p = 0.000) than those collected in carnauba (C. prunifera) palm trees. Also, microsatellite analysis demonstrated a high genetic differentiation between the two groups of R. nasutus (R(st) = -0.77). Our results suggest that the difference in size between the populations is probably related to an incipient process of genetic drift in populations associated to each palm tree, probably also driven by the different climatic features observed in these micro-environments.

AB  - A case-control study was conducted to examine the association among the Montenegro skin test (MST), age of skin lesion and therapeutic response in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) treated at Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INI), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For each treatment failure (case), two controls showing skin lesion healing following treatment, paired by sex and age, were randomly selected. All patients were treated with 5 mg Sb5+/kg/day of intramuscular meglumine antimoniate (Sb5+) for 30 successive days. Patients with CL were approximately five times more likely to fail when lesions were less than two months old at the first appointment. Patients with treatment failure showed less intense MST reactions than patients progressing to clinical cure. For each 10 mm of increase in MST response, there was a 26% reduction in the chance of treatment failure. An early treatment - defined as a treatment applied for skin lesions, which starts when they are less than two months old at the first appointment -, as well as a poor cellular immune response, reflected by lower reactivity in MST, were associated with treatment failure in cutaneous leishmaniasis.

AB  - The introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy during the 1990s was crucial to the decline in the rates of morbidity and death related to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and turned human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection into a chronic condition. Consequently, the HIV/AIDS population is becoming older. The aim of this study was to describe the immunological, clinical and comorbidity profile of an urban cohort of patients with HIV/AIDS followed up at Instituto de Pesquisa Clinica Evandro Chagas, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Retrospective data from 2307 patients during January 1st, 2008 and December 31st, 2008 were collected. For continuous variables, Cuzick's non-parametric test was used. For categorical variables, the Cochran-Armitage non-parametric test for tendency was used. For all tests, the threshold for statistical significance was set at 5%. In 2008, 1023 (44.3%), 823 (35.7%), 352 (15.3%) and 109 (4.7%) were aged 18-39, 40-49, 50-59 and >= 60 years-old, respectively. Older and elderly patients (>= 40 years) were more likely to have viral suppression than younger patients (18-39 years) (p < 0.001). No significant difference in the latest CD4(+) T lymphocyte count in the different age strata was observed, although elderly patients (>= 50 years) had lower CD4(+) T lymphocyte nadir (p < 0.02). The number of comorbidities increased with age and the same pattern was observed for the majority of the comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, erectile dysfunction, HCV, renal dysfunction and also for non-AIDS-related cancers (p < 0.001). With the survival increase associated to successful antiretroviral therapy and with the increasing new infections among elderly group, the burden associated to the diagnosis and treatment of the non-AIDS related HIV comorbidities will grow. Longitudinal studies on the impact of aging on the HIV/AIDS population are still necessary, especially in resource-limited countries. (c) 2013 Elsevier Editora Ltda. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Byrsonima verbascifolia is used in folk medicine to treat diarrhea, intestinal infections, chronic wounds, Chagas disease, inflammation and as a diuretic. However there is no investigation regarding the Byrsonima verbascifolia hydrometanolic extract (BVHME) used during gestation.
   Materials and methods: The pregnant females were randomly divided into 5 groups. Control group received saline plus DMSO (1%) in a volume of 0.1 mL/10 g (b.w.), via gavage, for at least 15 days prior to mating and throughout the gestational period. The Pre-treatment group received the BVHME, via gavage, at a dose of 50 mg/kg (b.w.) for at least 15 days prior to mating and up to the appearance of the vaginal plug. The Organogenesis group received the BVHME at a dose of 50 mg/kg (b.w.), via gavage, on the 5-15th gestational day. The Gestational group received the BVHME at a dose of 50 mg/kg (b.w.), via gavage, throughout the gestational period (from the 1st to the 18th day of pregnancy). The Pre+Gestational group received the BVHME at a dose of 50 mg/kg (b.w.), via gavage, for at least 15 days prior to mating and up to throughout the gestational period. The clinical signals of maternal and fetuses toxicity were evaluated, as the mutagenicity and immunomodulation tests were performed.
   Results and conclusions: The present investigation shows, for the first time, that the use of Byrsonima verbascifolia extract in pregnant Swiss mice, did not alter the female reproductive function, mutagenicity or immunostimulation as well as not interfere with embryofetal development at least in our experimental conditions.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the potential for infestation of man-made environments by Triatoma vitticeps, correlating the epidemiological importance of this species with that of others present in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. In addition, climatic variables that could help explain the distribution of this species and clarify its population dynamics were sought. This was done by carrying out a historical survey of the presence of T. vitticeps in artificial ecotopes, using data from the Fundacao Nacional de Saude (FUNASA). Monthly records of bioclimatic variables averaged for the period 1950-2000 and pixel size of 1 km x 1 km provided a reference for spatial distribution analysis. Annual rainfall and rainfall of the most humid trimester are the best indicators of the species distribution. To confirm the importance of these variables, T. vitticeps eggs were exposed to different levels of relative humidity. Hatching was found to vary significantly, and low humidity showed a significant negative effect on egg hatching. Our results demonstrate a strong association between T. vitticeps and high environmental humidity, which apparently acts as a limiting factor on the distribution of this triatomine.

AB  - The Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS), conducted from 1989 to 2001, and the REDS-II, conducted from 2004 to 2012, were National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute funded, multicenter programs focused on improving blood safety and availability in the United States. The REDS-II also included international study sites in Brazil and China. The 3 major research domains of REDS/REDS-II have been infectious disease risk evaluation, blood donation availability, and blood donor characterization. Both programs have made significant contributions to transfusion medicine research methodology by the use of mathematical modeling, large-scale donor surveys, innovative methods of repository sample storage, and establishing an infrastructure that responded to potential emerging blood safety threats such as xenotropic murine leukemia virus related virus. Blood safety studies have included protocols evaluating epidemiologic and/or laboratory aspects of human immunodeficiency virus, human T-lymphotropic virus 112, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, West Nile virus, cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 8, parvovirus B19, malaria, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, influenza, and Trypanosoma cruzi infections. Other analyses have characterized blood donor demographics, motivations to donate, factors influencing donor return, behavioral risk factors, donors' perception of the blood donation screening process, and aspects of donor deferral. In REDS-II, 2 large-scale blood donor protocols examined iron deficiency in donors and the prevalence of leukocyte antibodies. This review describes the major study results from over 150 peer-reviewed articles published by these 2 REDS programs. In 2011, a new 7-year program, the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study-III, was launched. The Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study-III expands beyond donor-based research to include studies of blood transfusion recipients in the hospital setting and adds a third country, South Africa, to the international program.

AB  - The importance of the genus Thrichomys in the retention of infection and transmission of Leishmania species is supported by previous studies that describe an ancient interaction between caviomorphs and trypanosomatids and report the natural infection of Thrichomys spp. Moreover, these rodents are widely dispersed in Brazil and recognized as important hosts of other tripanosomatids. Our main purpose was to evaluate the putative role of Thrichomys laurentius in the retention of infection and amplification of the transmission cycle of Leishmania infantum and L. braziliensis. Male and female T. laurentius (n = 24) born in captivity were evaluated for the retention of infection with these Leishmania species and followed up by parasitological, serological, hematological, biochemical, histological, and molecular assays for 3, 6, 9, or 12 months post infection (mpi). T. laurentius showed its competence as maintenance host for the two inoculated Leishmania species. Four aspects should be highlighted: (i) re-isolation of parasites 12 mpi; (ii) the low parasitic burden displayed by T. laurentius tissues; (iii) the early onset and maintenance of humoral response, and (iv) the similar pattern of infection by the two Leishmania species. Both Leishmania species demonstrated the ability to invade and maintain itself in viscera and skin of T. laurentius, and no rodent displayed any lesion, histological changes, or clinical evidence of infection. We also wish to point out the irrelevance of the adjective dermotropic or viscerotropic to qualify L. braziliensis and L. infantum, respectively, when these species are hosted by nonhuman hosts. Our data suggest that T. laurentius may act at least as a maintenance host of both tested Leishmania species since it maintained long-lasting infections. Moreover, it cannot be discarded that Leishmania spp. infection in free-ranging T. laurentius could result in higher parasite burden due the more stressing conditions in the wild. Therefore the tissular parasitism of the skin, infectiveness to the vector, and amplification of the transmission cycle of both Leishmania species could be expected.

AB  - In South America, visceral leishmaniasis is a zoonosis caused by the protozoan species Leishmania infantum (syn. L. chagasi) and is primarily transmitted through the bite of the female Lutzomyia longipalpis. Its main reservoir in urban areas is the dog. The application of control measures recommended by health agencies have not achieved significant results in reducing the incidence of human cases, and the lack of effective drugs to treat dogs resulted in the prohibition of this course of action in Brazil. Therefore, it is necessary to search new alternatives for the treatment of canine and human visceral leishmaniasis. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the in vitro effect of fractions from Aloe vera (aloe), Coriandrum sativum (coriander), and Ricinus communis (castor) on promastigotes and amastigotes of L. infantum and to analyze the toxicity against the murine monocytic cells RAW 264.7. To determine the viability of these substances on 50% parasites (IC50), we used a tetrazolium dye (MU) colorimetric assay (bromide 3-4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-dephenyltetrazolium), and on amastigotes we performed an in situ ELISA. All fractions were effective against L. infantum promastigotes and did not differ from the positive control pentamidine (p > 0.05). However, the R. communis ethyl acetate and chloroform fractions, as well as the C. sativum methanol fraction, were the most effective against amastigotes and did not differ from the positive control amphotericin B (p > 0.05). The R. communis ethyl acetate fraction was the least toxic, presenting 83.5% viability of RAW 264.7 cells, which was similar to the results obtained with amphotericin B (p > 0.05). Based on these results, we intend to undertake in vivo studies with R. communis ethyl acetate fractions due the high effectiveness against amastigotes and promastigotes of L. infantum and the low cytotoxicity towards murine monocytic cells.

AB  - Background: In high-income settings, the spectrum of morbidity and mortality experienced by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected individuals receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has switched from predominantly AIDS-related to non-AIDS-related conditions. In the context of universal access to care, we evaluated whether that shift would apply in Brazil, a middle-income country with universal access to treatment, as compared to France.
   Methods: Two hospital-based cohorts of HIV-infected individuals were used for this analysis: the ANRS CO3 Aquitaine Cohort in South Western France and the Evandro Chagas Research Institute (IPEC) Cohort of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Severe morbid events (AIDS-and non-AIDS-related) were defined as all clinical diagnoses associated with a hospitalization of >= 48 hours. Trends in the incidence rate of events and their determinants were estimated while adjusting for within-subject correlation using generalized estimating equations models with an auto-regressive correlation structure and robust standard errors.
   Result: Between January 2000 and December 2008, 7812 adult patients were followed for a total of 41,668 personyears (PY) of follow-up. Throughout the study period, 90% of the patients were treated with cART. The annual incidence rate of AIDS and non-AIDS events, and of deaths significantly decreased over the years, from 6.2, 21.1, and 1.9 AIDS, non-AIDS events, and deaths per 100 PY in 2000 to 4.3, 14.9, and 1.5/100 PY in 2008. The annual incidence rates of non-AIDS events surpassed that of AIDS-events during the entire study period. High CD4 cell counts were associated with a lower incidence rate of AIDS and non-AIDS events as well as with lower rates of specific non-AIDS events, such as bacterial, hepatic, viral, neurological, and cardiovascular conditions. Adjusted analysis showed that severe morbidity was associated with lower CD4 counts and higher plasma HIV RNAs but not with setting (IPEC versus Aquitaine).
   Conclusions: As information on severe morbidities for HIV-infected patients remain scarce, data on hospitalizations are valuable to identify priorities for case management and to improve the quality of life of patients with a chronic disease requiring life-long treatment. Immune restoration is highly effective in reducing AIDS and non-AIDS severe morbid events irrespective of the setting.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis is a disease whose etiological agent in Brazil is Leishmania infantum chagasi. Dogs are considered urban reservoirs of the disease, being an indicator of the human cases occurrence. The present study aimed to diagnose L. infantum chagasi infection in stray and owned dogs in Bel m, Par State, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using two different antigens. Venous blood samples from adult dogs, regardless of gender or breed, of different neighborhoods in Belem-PA, were collected in tubes with and without anticoagulant to obtain DNA and serum, respectively. These animals were divided into two groups: stray dogs captured by the Center for Zoonosis Control (Group A) and owned dogs (Group B). Sera were analyzed by IFA testing for IgG using two different antigens: 1) Bio-Manguinhos/Fiocruz antigen kit (Ag-PRO) containing promastigotes of Leishmania sp. (Complex Major-Like), 2) Instituto Evandro Chagas Antigen (Ag-AMA) consisting of amastigotes of L. infantum chagasi. The evaluation of the two antigens was performed considering positive the reactions above the 1: 80 dilution. Already PCR was performed with DNA isolated from whole blood of animals and amplified with the primers RV1 and RV2. Of the 335 samples analyzed, 10.4% (35/335) were positive by IFA (Ag-PRO) and 0.9% (3/335) with the Ag-AMA. The distribution of positive samples is given as follows: Group A 14.8% (25/169) with Ag-PRO and 1.2% (2/169) with Ag-AMA; Group B 6% (10/166) with Ag-PRO and 0.6% (1/166) with Ag-AMA, being that all samples positive by IFA with Ag-AMA also reacted with Ag-PRO, and none of the samples detected DNA of L. infantum chagasi. The findings of this study indicate that Bel m can still be considered non-endemic area for canine visceral leishmaniasis and the nature of the antigen influences the result of the IFA for the detection of anti-L. infantum chagasi antibodies in dogs, and the IFA using promastigotes of Leishmania major-like antigen should be used with caution as a confirmatory diagnostic on epidemiological studies in non-endemic areas.

AB  - Triatoma virus (TrV) is a small, non-enveloped virus that has a _ssRNA genome and is currently classified under the Cripavirus genus of the Dicistroviridae family. TrV infects haematophagous triatomine insects (Hemiptera: Reduviidae), which are vectors of American trypanosomosis (Chagas disease). TrV can be transmitted through the horizontal faecal-oral route, and causes either deleterious sublethal effects or even the death of laboratory insect colonies. Various species of triatomines from different regions of Latin America are currently being reared in research laboratories, with little or no awareness of the presence of TrV; therefore, any biological conclusion drawn from experiments on insects infected with this virus is inherently affected by the side effects of its infection. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to estimate the sample size required for detecting a TrV infection. We applied this model to screen the infection in the faeces of triatomines belonging to insectaries from 13 Latin American countries, carrying out the identification of TrV by using RT-PCR. TrV was detected in samples coming from Argentina, which is where the virus was first isolated from Triatoma infestans (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) several years ago. Interestingly, several colonies from Brazil were also found infected with the virus. This positive result widens the TrV's host range to a total of 14 triatomine species. Our findings suggest that many triatomine species distributed over a large region of South America may be naturally infected with TrV.

AB  - The objective of this study is to report on the colonization of palm trees by Rhodnius neglectus, its invasion in an urban area, in Aracatuba - Sao Paulo, and the control and surveillance measures that have been put in place. Domiciliary triatomine searches occurred in apartments upon the inhabitants' notification. The collected insects were identified and examined for natural infection and food sources with a precipitin test. To search the palm trees, tarps were used to cover the floor, and a "Munck" truck equipped with a tree-pruning device was utilized. Chemical control was performed with the utilization of a manual compression. In 2009, 81 specimens of Rhodnius neglectus were collected from the domiciles by the population. The precipitin test revealed a presence of human blood in 2.7% of the samples. Entomological studies were carried out in these domiciles and in those located within a radius of 200 meters. The search performed in the palm trees resulted in the capture of 882 specimens of triatomines, negative for tripanosomatids. Mechanical and chemical controls were carried out. New searches conducted in the palm trees in the same year resulted in the capture of six specimens. The mechanical and chemical controls of the palm trees, together with the population's work, proved to be effective, therefore preventing these insects' colonization of the city's domiciles.

AB  - Background: Trypanosoma evansi is a flagellate which belongs to the salivate section, commonly observed parasitizing blood of equines, ruminants, pigs, dogs and wild animals in different regions of the world. It causes many losses to farmers due to death of animals and drug spending in endemic areas. The treatment of this disease in Brazil is only performed with diminazene aceturate; however it has been ineffective for many animals. During the lats years many studies have been carried out with natural products such as the essential oils. Copaiba oil stands out due some properties described as anti-inflammatory, healing, antiedematogenic, antitumor, parasitic and antibacterial. Therefore, this study aimed to test, in vitro and in vivo, the susceptibility of T. evansi to copaiba oil.
   Materials, Methods & Results: The oils used in this study were obtained from Copaifera reticulata and Copaifera duckei trees, commonly found in the Tapajos National Forest. The procedure received authorization of IBAMA due the scientific purposes. This study identified three oils identified as copaiba 4-C (C. reticulata), copaiba 5-C (C. duckei) and copaiba 8-C (C. reticulata). The bioassay was performed in vitro using specific culture medium for T. evansi, previously described by Baltz, 1985. Copaiba oil was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and tested in three concentrations (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0%) in culture medium containing the parasite. To the control test (without oil) the same volume of DMSO (10 mu L) was added. Dimnazene aceturate was also used as a positive control at 0.5% of concentration. The counting of trypanosomes was performed in triplicate in a Neubauer chamber after 1, 3, and 6 hours after the experiment onset. For the tests in vivo, mice were infected (n = 40) and divided in 5 groups of 8 animals each. Group A consisted of healthy animals and Group B comprised animals infected with T. evansi and untreated. The other groups were infected and treated orally with oil of copaiba 4-C (Group C), copaiba 5-C (Group D) and copaiba 8-C (Group E), using a dose of 0.63 mL/kg/day for five consecutive days at intervals of 24 hours. In vitro tests with copaiba oil showed a reduction in the number of alive trypanosomes for the three tested concentrations, when compared to the control test after 1 and 3 h, similar to what occurred with testing aceturate. At 6 hours, it was not observed alive parasites in the test groups, differently from the control group which had an increase of trypanosomes compared to the time zero. The trypanocidal activity had a dose-dependent effect. In the in vivo experiment, the oil of copaiba administered orally had no curative efficacy for any of the groups; however group D treated with C. duckei showed prolonged longevity of the mice when compared to the groups B and C.
   Discussion: Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania amazonensis have been challenged on their susceptibility to oil of copaiba, with obtention of trypanocidal and leishmanicidal effects, similar process thet occurred in this study with T. evansi. According to scientific literature the copaiba oil increases the membrane permeability, as well as provides the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane in parasite cells. A group of mice in this study showed prolonged longevity, showing that the variation of their compositions influence the trypanocidal effect. Based on these results it was concluded that the T. evansi may is susceptible to the oil of copaiba. Therefore, it can be natural product used as a new alternative and supplementar activity in the treatment of this protozoan, as have been suggested for leishmaniasis.

AB  - Background: In the Amazon rainforest, biodiversity is a significant resource for traditional communities, as it can be used as a relevant source of protein and it has a promising zootherapeutic potential. Studies on knowledge and ways how local peoples use the fauna are still incipient. This paper presents both the knowledge on and food and medicinal uses of common opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) by riverine communities in an Amazon floodplain region.
   Methods: The study was conducted with riverine communities in the municipality of Abaetetuba, Par, Brazil. The main methods used were structured and semi-structured interviews, the "snowball" technique, and participant observation.
   Results: The study showed that D. marsupialis has an undeniable cultural significance for the local community, both in terms of food and medicine. Its meat is prized by inhabitants as it is classified as tasty, soft and, in some cases, it is designated as the best bushmeat in the region. The interviewees have demonstrated a thorough knowledge on various aspects of the animal's biology, such as its diet, behavior, and places of occurrence. The hunting activity is practiced by men, but the preparation of meat and medicinal oil are tasks mainly performed by women. In medical terms, common opossum is used in the treatment of various diseases, such as rheumatism, asthma, sore throat, and inflammation. Given the importance of this species, its meat or live individuals are often sold in the city fair at prices that can reach R$ 40.00 (U$D 18,00) per individual.
   Conclusions: D. marsupialis is an important source of protein for riverine communities in the region studied. Its fat is used as a traditional medicine and it is indicated for many types of diseases. Although the species concerned is treated with hostility in various Brazilian regions, in the case of Abaetetuba this animal is strongly prized due to the good quality of its meat. However, despite the value assigned to the species, its consumption should be the subject of further studies, as this marsupial species has been described as a reservoir for parasites that cause severe diseases.

AB  - Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) patients have a high risk of infection. We retrospectively investigated the prevalence of infection among SCA patients from Bahia, Brazil. A total of 1415 SCA patients were studied between 1995 and 2009: 190(13.4%) had hepatitis C virus (HCV), 67 (4.7%) had human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), 44(3.1%) had hepatitis B virus (HBV), 40 (2.8%) had Chagas' disease, 11(0.8%) had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and 5 (0.4%) had syphilis. Patients with HCV infection had a higher risk of hospitalisation (OR=1.52, 95% CI: 1.07-2.17, P=0.020), bone disorders (OR=1.94, 95% CI: 1.15-3.27, P=0.011), stroke (OR=2.17, 95% CI: 1.12-4.14, P=0.017), painful crisis (OR=1.61, 95% CI: 1.17-2.22, P=0.004) and leg ulcers (OR=1.61, 95% CI: 1.04-3.03, P=0.031). Patients with HBV infection had a higher risk for bone disorders (OR=4.90, 95% CI: 2.08-11.54, P<.010), stroke (OR=3.01, 95% CI: 1.29-6.04, P=0.007), painful crisis (OR=3.51, 95% CI: 1.62-7.63, P<0.001), acute chest syndrome (ACS) (OR=2.66, 95% CI: 1.34-5.28, P=0.004), leg ulcers (OR=6.60, 95% CI: 3.37-12.91, P<.001) and vaso-occlusive crisis (OR=6.34, 95% CI: 1.96-20.66, P<0.001). Patients with HTLV-I infection had a high risk for bone disorders (OR=2.94, 95% CI: 1.28-6.74, P=0.011), respiratory failure (OR=2.66.95% CI: 1.26-5.51, P=0.012), leg ulcers (OR=3.27, 95% CI: 1.69-6.11, P<.001), painful crisis (OR=1.82, 95% CI: 1.07-3.13, P=0.025) and ACS (OR=1.85, 95% CI: 1.10-3.41, P<.047). SCA patients with HCV infection had increased triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.036; P=0.027), iron serum (P=0.016) and ferritin (P=0.007). These results reveal important roles for these infections in SCA patients' clinical outcomes, and studies are warranted to determine the mechanisms utilised by these agents and their involvement in disease severity.

AB  - Background: Irregularly shaped spatial clusters are difficult to delineate. A cluster found by an algorithm often spreads through large portions of the map, impacting its geographical meaning. Penalized likelihood methods for Kulldorff's spatial scan statistics have been used to control the excessive freedom of the shape of clusters. Penalty functions based on cluster geometry and non-connectivity have been proposed recently. Another approach involves the use of a multi-objective algorithm to maximize two objectives: the spatial scan statistics and the geometric penalty function.
   Results & Discussion: We present a novel scan statistic algorithm employing a function based on the graph topology to penalize the presence of under-populated disconnection nodes in candidate clusters, the disconnection nodes cohesion function. A disconnection node is defined as a region within a cluster, such that its removal disconnects the cluster. By applying this function, the most geographically meaningful clusters are sifted through the immense set of possible irregularly shaped candidate cluster solutions. To evaluate the statistical significance of solutions for multi-objective scans, a statistical approach based on the concept of attainment function is used. In this paper we compared different penalized likelihoods employing the geometric and non-connectivity regularity functions and the novel disconnection nodes cohesion function. We also build multi-objective scans using those three functions and compare them with the previous penalized likelihood scans. An application is presented using comprehensive state-wide data for Chagas' disease in puerperal women in Minas Gerais state, Brazil.
   Conclusions: We show that, compared to the other single-objective algorithms, multi-objective scans present better performance, regarding power, sensitivity and positive predicted value. The multi-objective non-connectivity scan is faster and better suited for the detection of moderately irregularly shaped clusters. The multi-objective cohesion scan is most effective for the detection of highly irregularly shaped clusters.

AB  - Background: Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii species complex, which is distributed worldwide, especially in regions of tropical and subtropical climates. It can affect both humans and a great variety of animals, among which, the domestic dog and cat. Today is considered the subcutaneous mycosis more frequent in Brazil, due to the progressive increase of zoonotic transmission of the disease in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro.
   Review: In the endemic region of zoonotic sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro, veterinarians, their assistants and owners of cats with sporotrichosis are considered risk groups for acquiring the infection. Of the human cases of sporotrichosis in this endemic region that were accompanied by the Clinical Research Institute Evandro Chagas (IPEC / Fiocruz) in the period from 1998 to 2001, 5% of the patients diagnosed for the disease were veterinarians, demonstrating the occurrence of the infection in this occupational group. Biosafety is defined as a condition of security achieved by a set of measures aimed at the prevention, control, reduction or elimination of risks involved in activities that could endanger the health of humans, animals, plants and the environment. However, small animal veterinary pratictioners from the endemic region of Rio de Janeiro usually do not follow biosafety measures, which increases the risk of acquisition of sporotrichosis. In most cases, the infection results from traumatic inoculation of the fungus in skin and in humans, clinical forms may be: fixed or localized cutaneous, lymphatic-cutaneous, spread-cutaneous, mucosal and extra-cutaneous or systemic. In the endemic form of this disease that occurs in Rio de Janeiro, the cat is seen as a source of infection, The zoonotic potential of the cat is characterized by the abundance of yeasts found in their skin lesions and proximity with humans. Cats acquire the disease after fights with other infected cats and the skin lesions more frequently found are nodules and ulcers, covered or not by crusts, which can progress to necrosis with exposure of bones and muscles. The presence of respiratory signs, especially sneezing, with or without lesions in the mucosal and in the nasal region is common. The azole itraconazole is considered the drug of choice for humans and cats. However, unlike humans, the treatment is considered difficult in cats. The definitive diagnosis of sporotrichosis is obtained by isolation of Sporothrix in culture. Nonetheless, in cats, due to the great quantity of yeasts in their lesions, cytopathological test is strongly indicated in the presumptive diagnosis because of the speed in processing, low cost and no requirement of sophisticated technical training or complex laboratory structure.
   Discussion: A zoonotic form of sporotrichosis has become endemic in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro and the veterinarians are a high risk group for acquiring the disease as well as have a very important role in the application of measures for the prevention and control of sporotrichosis. Therefore, in this review, specific biosafety procedures to reduce risks during the handling of cats with suspected sporotrichosis by veterinarians, technicians, caretakers and owners of cats were described. The topics aproached were: clinical care of the cat (where were appointed the recommended personal protective equipment, animal restraint and good practices), decontamination of the environment, equipment and items used in the cat care and management of waste. Aspects related to the fungus and the disease itself were also discussed.

AB  - P>Objective
   To define the insecticide resistance status of Triatoma infestans to deltamethrin (pyrethroid), malathion (organophosphate) and bendiocarb (carbamate) in Bolivia.
   Methods
   Fifty populations of T. infestans were sampled in Bolivian human dwellings. Quantal response data were obtained by topical applications of 0.2 mu l of insecticide-acetone solutions on nymphs N1 of the F1 generations. For most populations, dose-mortality relationships and resistance ratios (RR) were analysed. Discriminating concentrations were established for each insecticide with a susceptible reference strain and used on the other field populations. A tarsal-contact diagnostic test using insecticide impregnated papers was designed to rapidly identify deltamethrin-resistant populations in the field.
   Results
   Discriminating concentrations for topical applications were 5, 70 and 120 ng active ingredient per insect for deltamethrin, bendiocarb and malathion, respectively. The diagnostic concentration for deltamethrin was 0.30% for the 1-h exposure by tarsal contact. All populations sampled in human dwellings exhibited significant levels of resistance to deltamethrin, from 6 to 491 and varied among regions. Resistant populations did not recover complete susceptibility to deltamethrin when the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) was used. None of the sampled populations exhibited significant resistance to bendiocarb (all RR(50) < 1.8) or malathion (all RR(50) < 2.2).
   Conclusion
   In Bolivia, most 'domestic'T. infestans populations are resistant to deltamethrin. Because insecticide vector control is the only selection pressure, resistance likely originates from it. Switching from pyrethroids to organophosphates or carbamates could be a short-term solution to control this vector, but other alternative integrated control strategies should also be considered in the long term.

AB  - The entomopathogenic anamorphic genus Evlachovaea was described to differ from other fungi in forming its conidia obliquely to the axis of the conidiogenous cell and with successive conidia having alternate orientations with a zipper- or chevron-like arrangement resulting in flat, ribbon-like chains. Morphological and molecular studies of six Evlachovaea-like isolates baited from Central Brazilian soils using Triatoma infestans (a vector of Chagas disease) and of other entomopathogens with Evlachovaea-like conidiogenesis led to a re-evaluation of the status of this little known fungal genus. The Brazilian isolates formed two distinct groups based on gene sequences for both the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and translation elongation factor (EF-1 alpha) genes, morphology, and growth patterns; both groups also differed from the type species, Evlachovaea kintrischica. More detailed studies of these fungi indicated that the altematingly oblique orientations of forming conidia are neither a stable nor invariant character (even on single phialides). Furthermore, the molecular cladistic analysis unambiguously placed the Eulachovaea isolates firmly within the genus Isaria (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae). The ITS sequences of E. kintrischica were very similar or even identical to those of Isaria amoenerosea and Isaria cateniobliqua, thereby suggesting that E. kintrischica is a synonym of one of these species, and that the genus Eulachovaea must be treated as a later synonym of Isaria, which must now be recognized to include several highly divergent modes of conidiogenesis. These taxonomic findings are discussed in the context of dramatic changes recently imposed on the nomen-clatural standards used to determine the correct names of all pleomorphic fungi.

AB  - Aim
   The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the dispersal of sylvatic triatomines to anthropic habitats is stimulated by degradation of their natural habitat.
   Location
   State of Espirito Santo, south-eastern Brazil.
   Methods
   We georeferenced records of domiciliary captures of sylvatic triatomines (1996-2005) obtained from the database of the entomological surveillance programme of the Brazilian National Health Foundation. We partitioned the study area into 543 equal hexagons and attributed information on the presence/absence of triatomines and climatic, topographic and biological variables to each. Using generalized additive models (GAMs), we defined the determinant variables for triatomine presence/absence and demarcated the potential areas in which they might occur. We then subjected the hexagons with a high probability of triatomine presence to a second analysis, adding information on the number of domiciliary captures of triatomines and landscape indices that measured quantitative and spatial patterns of forest fragments. We used GAMs to determine the indices that influenced the number of domiciliary captures of triatomines.
   Results
   The presence of triatomines was characterized by a strong positive correlation with variability of terrain slope. This variable was used to demarcate the areas where triatomines were likely to occur. Landscape indices associated with the number of domiciliary captures of triatomines were the number of patches, the fractal dimension index, the total core area and the clumpiness index.
   Main conclusions
   Our results do not support the hypothesis that domiciliary invasion by sylvatic triatomines is stimulated by environmental degradation. Instead, the results suggest that less degraded areas maintain larger populations of triatomines and consequently present higher indices of dispersal and domiciliary invasion. Particular landscape patterns and dispositions of human dwellings, however, may enhance the probability of triatomines being attracted to the artificial light of dwellings. Initiation of flight and consequent dispersal is a naturally occurring process that allows triatomines to find and colonize areas that favour the survival of their offspring.

AB  - Background: Leishmania (V.) braziliensis is a causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Brazil. During the parasite life cycle, the promastigotes adhere to the gut of sandflies, to avoid being eliminated with the dejection. The Lulo cell line, derived from Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae), is a suitable in vitro study model to understand the features of parasite adhesion. Here, we analyze the role of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) from Lulo cells and proteins from the parasites in this event.
   Methods: Flagellar (F-f) and membrane (M-f) fractions from promastigotes were obtained by differential centrifugation and the purity of fractions confirmed by western blot assays, using specific antibodies for cellular compartments. Heparin-binding proteins (HBP) were isolated from both fractions using a HiTrap-Heparin column. In addition, binding of promastigotes to Lulo cells or to a heparin-coated surface was assessed by inhibition assays or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis.
   Results: The success of promastigotes subcellular fractionation led to the obtainment of F-f and M-f proteins, both of which presented two main protein bands (65.0 and 55.0kDa) with affinity to heparin. The contribution of HBPs in the adherence of promastigotes to Lulo cells was assessed through competition assays, using HS or the purified HBPs fractions. All tested samples presented a measurable inhibition rate when compared to control adhesion rate (17 +/- 2.0% of culture cells with adhered parasites): 30% (for HS 20 mu g/ml) and 16% (for HS 10 mu g/ml); HBP M-f (35.2% for 10 mu g/ml and 25.4% for 20 mu g/ml) and HBP F-f (10.0% for 10 mu g/ml and 31.4% for 20 mu g/ml). Additionally, to verify the presence of sulfated GAGs in Lulo cells surface and intracellular compartment, metabolic labeling with radioactive sulfate was performed, indicating the presence of an HS and chondroitin sulfate in both cell sections. The SPR analysis performed further confirmed the presence of GAGs ligands on L. (V.) braziliensis promastigote surfaces.
   Conclusions: The data presented here point to evidences that HBPs present on the surface of L. (V.) braziliensis promastigotes participate in adhesion of these parasites to Lulo cells through HS participation.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy is a common neurological disorder. There may be important differences and similarities in the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy between North America (NA) and South America (SA). Neuromuscular databases were searched for neuropathy diagnosis at two North American sites, University of Kansas Medical Center and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and one South American site, Federal Fluminense University in Brazil. All patients were included into one of the six major categories: immune-mediated, diabetic, hereditary, infectious/inflammatory, systemic/metabolic/toxic (not diabetic) and cryptogenic. A comparison of the number of patients in each category was made between North America and South America databases. Total number of cases in North America was 1090 and in South America was 1034 [immune-mediated: NA 215 (19.7%), SA 191 (18%); diabetic: NA 148 (13.5%), SA 236 (23%); hereditary: NA 292 (26.7%), SA 103 (10%); infectious/inflammatory: NA 53 (4.8%), SA 141 (14%); systemic/metabolic/toxic: NA 71 (6.5%), SA 124 (12%); cryptogenic: NA 311 (28.5%), SA 239 (23%)]. Some specific neuropathy comparisons were hereditary neuropathies [Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) cases] in NA 246/292 (84.2%) and SA 60/103 (58%); familial amyloid neuropathy in SA 31/103 (30%) and none in NA. Among infectious neuropathies, cases of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) neuropathy in SA were 36/141(25%), Chagas disease in SA were 13/141(9%) and none for either in NA; cases of neuropathy due to leprosy in NA were 26/53 (49%) and in SA were 39/141(28%). South American tertiary care centers are more likely to see patients with infectious, diabetic and hereditary disorders such as familial amyloid neuropathies. North American tertiary centers are more likely to see patients with CMT. Immune neuropathies and cryptogenic neuropathies were seen equally in North America and South America.

AB  - Because infected dogs are widely considered to be the main domestic reservoir for Leishmania infantum (syn Leishmania chagasi) parasites in Brazil, the diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) must be made both accurately and promptly. The present study attempted to standardize a conventional polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) protocol for the detection of L infantum DNA in canine spleen samples. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) technique was used to confirm the presence of Leishmania DNA in the canine spleen fragments. A comparison was made between the efficacies of these molecular diagnostic techniques and conventional parasitological and serological methods. cPCR protocols for spleen samples were standardized using primers that amplify a 145 bp fragment, located at the parasite kinetoplast minicircle. The genus specificity of the cPCR protocol was assessed by its inability to amplify the DNA of other common canine pathogens, such as Ehrlichia canis, Babesia canis, Toxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma cruzi. cPCR protocol sensitivity was tested by assessing the reaction detection limit, determined to be 10 fg of L infantum reference strain DNA, which corresponds to a range of 0.03-0.1 parasites per fragment. Standardized cPCR protocol was used to detect the presence of Leishmania in 45 dog spleen samples. Our results showed that 40% of the spleen fragment cultures were positive for Leishmania parasites, 58% of the dog serum samples tested positive using ELISA, and parasite DNA was detected in 44% using qPCR, while 47% of the spleen samples using cPCR. Diagnostic methods performance was assessed and revealed a better degree of ascertainment for cPCR when compared to other diagnostic methods. The sensitivity of ELISA was 83.3%, qPCR was 83.3%, and cPCR was 88.9%; PPV for ELISA was 57.7%, qPCR was 75% and cPCR was 76.2%; the Kappa coefficients were found to be 0.40 (fair) for ELISA, 0.64 (substantial) for qPCR and 0.68 (substantial) for cPCR. In both oligosymptomatic and polysymptomatic dogs, cPCR revealed the better performance analysis when compared to other diagnostic methods. The findings presented herein establish cPCR as the most indicated test to detect Leishmania when compared to the other two diagnostic methods evaluated. Despite the fact that the qPCR protocol provides a highly accurate quantification of parasites when targeting the SSU rRNA gene, this technique does not significantly improve the diagnosis of CVL when compared with the performance of the cPCR protocol, which focused on the kinetoplast minicircle.

AB  - Study design: Cross-sectional study.
   Objectives: To determine the prevalence of falls in human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients and possible factors associated to their occurrence.
   Setting: Instituto de Pesquisa Clinica Evandro Chagas, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ) - Brazil.
   Methods: Thirty-six HAM/TSP patients able to walk at least 20 m were assessed by a questionnaire. Data regarding gender, age, duration of disease (DD), HTLV-I proviral load (HPL), frequency of physical activity (FCA), use of walking aids, functional ambulation level, the number of falls and associated injuries in the last year were reviewed. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to group characteristics of this sample according to the fall occurrence.
   Results: The prevalence of falls was 63.9% and we observed injuries in 47.8% of the cases. Four groups were identified in the descriptive analysis. One group was formed by faller individuals, men <60 years, independent ambulation, FCA >= 3 times per week and HPL <6.6 copies per 100 cells (group B). The other one comprised non-faller patients, women >= 60 years, restricted ambulation, DD >= 7 years, use of orthosis, FCA 0-1 time per week and HPL >= 6.6 copies per 100 cells (group D). The others two groups comprised individuals that did not use orthosis (group A) and those that FCA was two times per week and DD <7 years (group C).
   Conclusion: Falls occur in roughly two-thirds of ambulatory HAM/TSP patients and are associated with significant morbidity. Further studies with a larger number of patients are necessarily to identify risk factors in order to elaborate specific programs to prevent falls in this population.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Rourea induta Planch. is a small tree or shrub growing wild in Brazil and belonging to the Connaraceae family. It is used for the treatment of Chagas disease and as antirheumatic in folk medicine. This study was designed to investigate the antinociceptive activity of the aqueous extract (AERi) of Rourea induta leaves in rodents, as well as isolate and identify components that can be responsible for its effect.
   Material and methods: The antinociceptive effect of orally administered AERi was evaluated in behavioral models of acute (formalin) and chronic [complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)] pain in mice. We also investigated the possible involvement of opioid receptors and proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-Ill and tumor necrosis factor-a) in the antinociceptive effect of the AERi. In addition, a nonspecific effect of AERi was evaluated by measuring locomotor activity and corporal temperature. Finally, we performed a phytochemical analysis of AERi.
   Results: HPLC titration revealed the presence of hyperin (21.6 mg/g), quercetin-3-O-beta-xyloside (4.4 mg/g), quercetin-3-O-alpha-arabinofuranoside (12.0 mg/g), and quercetin (2.1 mg/g). It was also possible to isolate minor constituents' chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid and procyanidin Cl. The oral administration of AERi (100 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the neurogenic (37 +/- 5%) and inflammatory (34 +/- 7%) phases of formalin-induced pain. Acute and repeated treatment of animals with AERi (100 mg/kg, p.o.) once a day markedly reduced the mechanical hypersensitivity response induced by CFA, and this effect was evident until the day 10. Moreover, repeated treatment with AERi (100 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced the levels of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in the paw (22 +/- 7% and 50 +/- 19%) and in the spinal cord (100% and 100%) when compared to the CFA group. The AERi (100 mg/kg, p.o.) markedly reduced biting behavior induced by intrathecal injection of TNF-alpha (81 +/- 11%). Finally, the effect of AERi was not associated with changes in locomotor activity or the corporal temperature of animals.
   Conclusion: These data show that aqueous extract of Rourea induta has significant antinociceptive action, which seems to be associated with an inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines activated pathways. These findings support the ethnomedical uses of this plant. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
