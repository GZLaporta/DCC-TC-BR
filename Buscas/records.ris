N2  - Aims: Throughout gestation, proteins in the diet are a source of essential amino acids that are crucial for proper healthy fetal growth and development. The present study was proposed to investigate the effect of high-protein diet consumption throughout pregnancy on redox homeostasis, neuroinflammatory status and amino acid levels, including homocysteine, in the male adolescent rats offspring's cerebral cortex. We also performed a battery of behavioral tests to evaluate maternal care, olfactory preference, exploratory capacity, habituation, memory, anxiety- and depression-like behavior motor activity in the offspring. Main methods: After pregnancy confirmation, the pregnant rats were randomly divided into two groups, according to the diet: group 1, (control) standard diet containing 20 % protein, and group 2, the high-protein diet containing 50 % protein. Throughout the gestational period, the pregnant rats received experimental diets. Key findings: Results showed an increase in homocysteine levels and neuroinflammatory mediators in the offspring's cerebral cortex from pregnant rats supplemented with a high-protein diet throughout pregnancy. Besides decreasing histidine levels in offspring's serum. The results also revealed an impairment in memory and motricity and an increase in anxiety-like behavior in the offspring supplemented with a high-protein diet throughout pregnancy. Our findings showed a significant effect of high-protein diet consumption throughout pregnancy on offspring's neurobiochemistry, which can negatively impact behavioral performance. Significance: Our results reinforce the importance of consuming a balanced diet during the gestational period, especially macronutrients such as proteins since the fetus is sensitive to the mother's diet during pregnancy which may impact the development of the offspring.

N2  - Human T-lymphotropic viruses 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/2) have a worldwide distribution. HTLV-1 has been associated with several diseases, including an aggressive malignant disease known as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and a chronic inflammatory neurological disease called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy, while HTLV-2 has not been definitively associated with diseases. HTLV-2 is most prevalent in specific groups such as injecting drug users and the indigenous population. In Brazil, most studies about HTLV in indigenous are carried out in indigenous communities from the north of the country. Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), Central Brazil, has the second-largest indigenous population in Brazil. However, there is no available data about HTLV infection in this group. We conducted the first investigation of HTLV-1/2 infection prevalence in the indigenous population from Jaguapiru and Bororó villages in Dourados City, MS, to provide the prevalence and molecular characterization of HTLV. For that, a total of 1875 indigenous participated in the study. All the serum samples were screened by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay commercial kit for the presence of anti-HTLV-1/2 antibodies. Positive samples were confirmed by HTLV-1/2 Western Blot assay. The HTLV-1 5'LTR region was detected by nested PCR amplification and sequenced by Sanger. Most of the study population declared belonging to Guarani-Kaiowá ethnicity (69.18%), 872 (46.51%), and 1003 (53.49%) were from Jaguapiru and Bororó villages, respectively. The median age of participants was 31 years, and 74.24% were females. Two individuals were detected with HTLV-1 (0.1%; CI 95% 0.1-0.2). The phylogenetic analysis revealed that isolates belong to the Cosmopolitan subtype and the Transcontinental subgroup (HTLV-1aA). The low HTLV-1 prevalence found in this study is similar to that observed among blood donors, and pregnant populations from Mato Grosso do Sul. The absence of HTLV-2 infection among these Brazilian indigenous communities would suggest a distinct behavior pattern from other indigenous populations in Brazil.

N2  - In Brazil, the notification of congenital (CS) and syphilis in pregnant women (SiP) is compulsory. Notification data provided by the Ministry of Health in combination with the mapping of vulnerable geographic areas is essential to forecasting possible outbreaks and more effectively combating infection through monitoring. We aim to evaluate the spatiotemporal distribution and epidemiological aspects of reported cases of CS and SiP in Brazil. A retrospective ecological study was carried out using secondary surveillance data obtained from the Brazilian National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) database, considering all reported cases of CS and SiP between 2001 to 2017. Epidemiological characteristics and time trends were analyzed using joinpoint regression models and spatial distribution, considering microregions or states/macroregions as units of analysis. A total of 188,630 (359/100,000 birth lives) CS and 235,895 of SiP (6.3/100,000 inhabitants) were reported during the period studied. In general, the epidemiologic profile of Brazil indicates most reported CS cases occurred in "mixed-race" newborns who were diagnosed within seven days of birth and whose mothers had received prenatal care, but the epidemiologic profile varies by Brazilian macroregion. Regarding SiP, most cases were among women who self-reported ‘mixed-race’, were aged 20–39 years, had up to eight years of formal education and were diagnosed with primary or latent syphilis. Approximately 549 (98.4%) and 558 (100%) microregions reported at least one case of CS and SiP, respectively. From 2012 to 2016, CS cases increased significantly in almost all Brazilian states, most notably in the South, Southeast, and Central-West macroregions, from 2001–2017 and the relative risk (RR) of SiP increased around 400% (RR: 1,00 to 445,50). Considering the epidemiological scenario of the infection in Brazil, it is necessary to enhance preventive, control and eradication measures.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical features and outcomes of infective endocarditis (IE) in pregnant women who do not inject drugs. METHODS: A multinational retrospective study was performed at 14 hospitals. All definite IE episodes between January 2000 and April 2021 were included. The main outcomes were maternal mortality and pregnancy-related complications. RESULTS: Twenty-five episodes of IE were included. Median age at IE diagnosis was 33.2 years (IQR 28.3-36.6) and median gestational age was 30 weeks (IQR 16-32). Thirteen (52%) patients had no previously known heart disease. Sixteen (64%) were native IE, 7 (28%) prosthetic and 2 (8%) cardiac implantable electronic device IE. The most common aetiologies were streptococci (n = 10, 40%), staphylococci (n = 5, 20%), HACEK group (n = 3, 12%) and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 3, 12%). Twenty (80%) patients presented at least one IE complication; the most common were heart failure (n = 13, 52%) and symptomatic embolism other than stroke (n = 4, 16%). Twenty-one (84%) patients had surgery indication and surgery was performed when indicated in 19 (90%). There was one maternal death and 16 (64%) patients presented pregnancy-related complications (11 patients ≥1 complication): 3 pregnancy losses, 9 urgent Caesarean sections, 2 emergency Caesarean sections, 1 fetal death, and 11 preterm births. Two patients presented a relapse during a median follow-up of 3.1 years (IQR 0.6-7.4). CONCLUSIONS: Strict medical surveillance of pregnant women with IE is required and must involve a multidisciplinary team including obstetricians and neonatologists. Furthermore, the potential risk of IE during pregnancy should never be underestimated in women with previously known underlying heart disease.

N2  - SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family. Other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were associated with complications in pregnant women. Therefore, this study aimed to report the clinical history of five pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (four symptomatic and one asymptomatic who gave birth to a stillborn child) during the COVID-19 pandemic. They gave birth between August 2020 to January 2021, a period in which there was still no vaccination for COVID-19 in Brazil. In addition, their placental alterations were later investigated, focusing on macroscopic, histopathological, and ultrastructural aspects compared to a prepandemic sample. Three of five placentas presented SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCRq at least two to twenty weeks after primary pregnancy infection symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was detected in all placentas by immunoperoxidase assay. The macroscopic evaluation of the placentas presented congested vascular trunks, massive deposition of fibrin, areas of infarctions, and calcifications. Histopathological analysis showed fibrin deposition, inflammatory infiltrate, necrosis, and blood vessel thrombosis. Ultrastructural aspects of the infected placentas showed a similar pattern of alterations between the samples, with predominant characteristics of apoptosis and detection of virus-like particles. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in placental tissue, vertical transmission.

N2  - We report the successful closure of Phase I clinical trials of the Schistosoma mansoni 14 kDa fatty acid-binding protein (Sm14) + glucopyranosyl lipid A in squalene emulsion (GLA-SE) vaccine candidate against human Schistosomiasis, comprising Phases Ia and Ib. Shown here are the results of Phase Ib, an open, not placebo-controlled, standardized-dose immunization trial, involving 10 healthy 18-49 years old women submitted to the same clinical protocol and the same batch of cGMP Sm14+GLA-SE used in Phase Ia, which was one on men. Fifty µg Sm14 protein plus 10 µg GLA-SE per dose were given intramuscularly thrice at 30-day intervals. Participants were assessed clinically, biochemically, and immunologically for up to 120 days. In preambular experiments involving vaccinated pregnant female rabbits, we did not find any toxicological feature either in offspring or mothers, as ascertained by histopathology and biochemical parameters. The vaccine induced adaptive immunity in the animals, as defined by the detection of anti-Sm14 antibodies in the sera. In women, neither serious nor light adverse events were observed. Sm14+GLA-SE vaccination induced high titers of anti-Sm14 serum IgG antibody production. Total anti-IgG serum levels remained high 120 days after the first vaccination dose. Significant increases in Sm14-specific total IgG, IgG1, and IgG3 were observed 30 days after the first vaccination, with specific IgG2 and IgG4 after 60 days. Sm14+GLA-SE vaccination also elicited robust cytokine responses with increased TNFα, IFNγ, and IL-2 profiles in all female vaccinees on days 90 and 120. As in Phase Ia, the Sm14+GLA-SE vaccine was shown to be strongly immunogenic and well tolerated. The completion of Phase I clinical trials performed to the highest standards set by the Good Clinical Research Practice (GCP) standards and pre-clinical data in pregnant rabbits enabled the vaccine candidate to proceed to Phase II clinical trials in endemic areas.

N2  - Aims: To evaluate the association of gestational weight gain and adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes among Brazilian women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: Cross-sectional study conducted in women with GDM, and their newborns, who attended a public maternity hospital. The Institute of Medicine criteria were adopted to assess adequacy of gestational weight gain (GWG). Cesarean delivery, maternal hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), premature birth, macrosomia, and birth weight adequacy for gestational age were analyzed as outcomes. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were tested to assess the effect of adequacy of GWG on maternal and newborn outcomes. Results: Among the 545 women studied, 64.2% (n = 344) had inadequate weight gain: 27.2% (n = 146) insufficient and 37% (n = 198) excessive. Women with insufficient GWG were more likely to have a preterm birth (OR 2.57; 95% CI: 1.06–6.19), while those with excessive GWG had a greater chance of HDP (OR 2.62; 95% CI: 1.54–4.45) and large for gestational age newborn (OR 1.88; 95% CI: 1.08–3.29), compared with those with adequate weight gain. Conclusions: Inadequate gestational weight gain was frequent in women with GDM, especially in pregnant women with overweight and obesity, and is associated with unfavorable outcomes.

N2  - Objectives: To describe the differences in clinical presentation and relative disease burden of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS)-associated microcephaly at 2 large hospitals in Salvador, Brazil that serve patients of different socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: Clinical and serologic data were collected prospectively from pregnant women and their infants, who delivered at 2 study centers during the 2015–2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Salvador, Brazil. Results: Pregnant women from Salvador, Brazil delivering in a low SES hospital had 3 times higher ZIKV exposure rate than women at a high SES hospital. However, different SES hospitals had similar prevalence of infants with CZS-associated microcephaly (10% vs 6%, p = 0.16) after controlling for ZIKV exposure in their mothers. Conclusions: Our study supports the positive association between low SES, high maternal ZIKV exposure, and high rates of CZS-associated microcephaly.

N2  - Thyroid hormones (THs) are required for the growth and development of the fetus, stimulating anabolism, and oxygen consumption from the early stages of pregnancy to the period of fetal differentiation close to delivery. Maternal changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis are also well known. In contrast, several open questions remain regarding the relationships between the placenta and the maternal and fetal TH systems. The exact mechanism by which the placenta participates in regulating the TH concentration in the fetus and mother and the role of TH in the placenta are still poorly studied. In this review, we aim to summarize the available data in the area and highlight significant gaps in our understanding of the ontogeny and cell-specific localization of TH transporters, TH receptors, and TH metabolic enzymes in the placenta in both human and rodent models. Significant deficiencies also exist in the knowledge of the contribution of genomic and nongenomic effects of TH on the placenta and finally, how the placenta reacts during pregnancy when the mother has thyroid disease. By addressing these key knowledge gaps, improved pregnancy outcomes and management of women with thyroid alterations may be possible.

N2  - Pregnancy diet can impact offspring’s neurodevelopment, metabolism, redox homeostasis, and inflammatory status. In pregnancy, folate demand is increased due to the requirement for one-carbon transfer reactions. The present study was proposed to investigate the effect of folic acid supplementation throughout pregnancy on a battery of behavior tests (olfactory preference, motor activity, exploratory capacity, habituation, memory, anxiety- and depression-like behavior). Redox homeostasis and neuroinflammatory status in cerebral cortex were also investigated. After pregnancy confirmation, the pregnant rats were randomly divided into two groups, according to the diet: group 1, (control) standard diet (2 mg/kg diet of folic acid) and group 2, supplemented diet with 4 mg/kg diet of folic acid. Throughout the gestational period, the pregnant rats received experimental diets. Results show that the supplemented diet with 4 mg/kg diet of folic acid throughout pregnancy impaired memory and motricity of the offspring when compared with control (standard diet). It was also observed an increase in anxiety- and depression-like behavior in this group. Nitrite levels increased in cerebral cortex of the offspring, when compared to control group. In contrast, iNOS expression and immunocontent were not altered. Moreover, we identify an increase in TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and MCP-1 gene expression in the cerebral cortex. In conclusion, our study showed that the supplemented diet with 4 mg/kg diet of folic acid throughout pregnancy may cause behavioral and biochemical changes in the male offspring Graphical abstract[Figure not available: see fulltext.]

N2  - Introduction Low birth weight (LBW) is associated with a wide range of short-term and long-term consequences and is related to maternal psychosocial and behavioural determinants. The objective of this study is to estimate the effect of implementing fast-track referral for early intervention on psychosocial and behavioural risk factors - smoking, alcohol consumption, depression and physical violence - in reducing the incidence of LBW. Methods and analysis Parallel superiority pragmatic clinical trial randomised by clusters. Primary healthcare units (PHCU) located in Portugal will be randomised (1:1) to intervention or control groups. Pregnant women over 18 years of age attending these PHCU will be eligible to the study. Risk factors will be assessed through face-to-face interviews. In the intervention group, women who report at least one risk factor will have immediate access to referral services. The comparison group will be the local standard of care for these risk factors. We will use intention-to-treat analyses to compare intervention and control groups. We estimated a sample size of 2832 pregnant women to detect a 30% reduction in the incidence rate of LBW between the control and intervention groups. Secondary outcomes are the reduction of preterm births, reduction of the four risk factors and acceptance of the intervention. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Public Health Institute of the University of Porto (no CE20140). The findings will be disseminated to the public, the funders, health professionals, health managers and other researchers. Trial registration number NCT04866277.

N2  - Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with increased risk of maternal and neonatal complications. We investigated obesity-related polymorphisms in the FTO gene (rs9939609, rs17817449) and ADRB2 (rs1042713, rs1042714) as candidate risk factors concerning excessive GWG in pregnant women with pregestational diabetes. This nutrigenetic trial, conducted in Brazil, randomly assigned 70 pregnant women to one of the groups: traditional diet (n = 41) or DASH diet (n = 29). Excessive GWG was the total weight gain above the upper limit of the recommendation, according to the Institute of Medicine guidelines. Genotyping was performed using real-time PCR. Time-to-event analysis was performed to investigate risk factors for progression to excessive GWG. Regardless the type of diet, AT carriers of rs9939609 (FTO) and AA carriers of rs1042713 (ADRB2) had higher risk of earlier exceeding GWG compared to TT (aHR 2.44; CI 95% 1.03–5.78; p = 0.04) and GG (aHR 3.91; CI 95% 1.12–13.70; p = 0.03) genotypes, respectively, as the AG carriers for FTO haplotype rs9939609:rs17817449 compared to TT carriers (aHR 1.79; CI 95% 1.04–3.06; p = 0.02).

N2  - This article aims to evaluate the completeness of the pregnant woman’s card filling according to a model standardized by the Ministry of Health. Hospital based, nationwide, cross-sectional study conducted between 2011 and 2012, evaluated data from pregnant women’s cards. Variables related to personal, obstetric history and current pregnancy data were used to assess completeness. We used the Kotelchuck index for quantitative evaluation. We analysed 6,577 cards, equivalent to 39% of the cards presented at the time of delivery. The mean completeness was overall “bad” in Brazil and macro-regions, except in the Southern region. Nationwide, the mean completion was “regular” for personal antecedents, “good” for obstetric history, and “bad” for fields related to the current pregnancy. Prenatal care was adequate for 58% of pregnant women. We observed a reduced use of the card recommended by the Ministry of Health and failures in the completeness of filling valuable information of the pregnant woman’s card, related to the current pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: To analyze the socioeconomic, demographic, environmental, reproductive, behavioral, and health-care factors associated with preterm birth. Methods: Case-control study, with case group composed of preterm infants and the control group by full term live births. Each case was paired with two controls according to sex and date of birth. Interviews were carried out with the mothers, as well as analysis of medical records. A logistic regression model was used for data analysis following the hierarchical order of entry of the blocks. Results: 221 live births were allocated in the case group and 442 in the control group. After analysis adjusted for other factors under study, the highest chances of prematurity were associated with being the first child (OR 1.96; 95%CI 1.34-2.86; p=0.001); mothers with the highest income (OR 2.08; 95%CI 1.41-3.08; p<0.001), mothers with previous preterm births (OR 3.98; 95%CI 2.04-7.79; p<0.001), mothers that suffered violence during pregnancy (OR 2.50; 95%CI 1.31-4.78; p=0.005) and underwent cesarean section (OR 2.35; 95%CI 1.63-3.38; p<0.001). Live births to mothers who had more than six prenatal consultations had a lower risk of prematurity (OR 0.39; 95%CI 0.26-0.58; p<0.001). Conclusions: The factors associated with a higher chance of prematurity were: higher family income, previous preterm child, primiparity, violence against pregnant women and cesarean section. Having attended more than six prenatal visits was associated with a lower chance of premature birth. Violence against pregnant women showed a strong and consistent association, remaining in all final models, and should serve as an alert for the population and professionals.

N2  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) caused neurological abnormalities in more than 3500 Brazilian newborns between 2015 and 2020. Data have pointed to oxidative stress in astrocytes as well as to dysregulations in neural cell proliferation and cell cycle as important events accounting for the cell death and neurological complications observed in Congenital Zika Syndrome. Copper imbalance has been shown to induce similar alterations in other pathologies, and disturbances in copper homeostasis have already been described in viral infections. Here, we investigated copper homeostasis imbalance as a factor that could contribute to the cytotoxic effects of ZIKV infection in astrocytes. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived astrocytes were infected with ZIKV; changes in the gene expression of copper homeostasis proteins were analyzed. The effect of the administration of CuCl2 or a copper chelator on oxidative stress, cell viability and percentage of infection were also studied. ZIKV infection leads to a downregulation of one of the transporters mediating copper release, ATP7B protein. We also observed the activation of mechanisms that counteract high copper levels, including the synthesis of copper chaperones and the reduction of the copper importer protein CTR1. Finally, we show that chelator-mediated copper sequestration in ZIKV-infected astrocytes reduces the levels of reactive oxygen species and improves cell viability, but does not change the overall percentage of infected cells. In summary, our results show that copper homeostasis imbalance plays a role in the pathology of ZIKV in astrocytes, indicating that it may also be a factor accounting for the developmental abnormalities in the central nervous system following viral infection. Evaluating micronutrient levels and the use of copper chelators in pregnant women susceptible to ZIKV infection may be promising strategies to manage novel cases of congenital ZIKV syndrome.

N2  - Objectives: We assessed real-world weight change and pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women living with HIV who used integrase strand transferase inhibitor (INSTI)-based combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Methods: In a retrospective cohort study from 2014 to 2021 for prevention of perinatal HIV infection, we evaluated changes in weight from the first prenatal visit to near delivery for two groups. The categories of change were: low (< 0.18 kg/week), normal (0.18–0.59 kg/week), and high (> 0.59 kg/week). The backbones were lamivudine + tenofovir disoproxil or lamivudine + zidovudine. The comparison groups were women with body mass index (BMI) < 25 kg/m2 versus BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 and INSTI-naïve versus INSTI-experienced. Continuous variables were analysed with a Kruskal–Wallis test and count or categorical data with χ2 tests. Results: We enrolled 198 pregnant women. At study entry, 74 had BMI < 25 kg/m2 and 124 had BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2. Excess gestational weight gain was more frequent among women who were INSTI-naïve among both BMI groups (< 25 and ≥ 25). However, the proportion of participants per weight change category was only significantly different between INSTI-naïve women with baseline BMI < 25 kg/m2 and INSTI-experienced women with BMI < 25 kg/m2. In particular, INSTI-naïve women with BMI < 25 kg/m2 had significantly higher rates of excess gestational weight gain (31.6%) compared with participants with BMI < 25 kg/m2 who conceived while on INSTIs (11.8%, p = 0.004). Rates of unfavourable pregnancy outcomes were low and did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusions: INSTI-naïve participants with BMI < 25 kg/m2 gained more weight during pregnancy than participants with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 who conceived while using INSTIs. Rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes did not differ between the groups.

N2  - Objective: to summarize literature regarding the effects of cannabis use during pregnancy on low birthweight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB) and small for gestational age (SGA). Study Design: systematic review and meta-analysis. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO and Web of Science in May 2021 and updated in November 2021. Only studies that assessed the isolated use of cannabis during pregnancy, controlling for cigarette smoking and other illicit drug use, were included. Data was synthesized using a narrative summary and pooled adjusted estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each outcome. Data was analyzed using Stata 13.0 with METAN software package, using random effects. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran's Q and Higgins I2 tests. Results: 32 studies were included with data from approximately 5.5 million women for the LBW outcome and 23 million for the PTB and SGA outcomes. Pregnant women using cannabis are at increased risk for LBW (aOR= 1.52; 95%CI= [1.18;1.96]), PTB (aOR= 1.39; 95%CI= [1.28;1.51]), and SGA (aOR= 1.47; 95%CI= [1.38;1.58]). Studies that assessed type of preterm birth and gestational age at birth indicate higher risks of spontaneous PTB and of early or very-early preterm births associated with cannabis use during pregnancy. The few studies that assessed the timing and frequency of consumption suggest a dose-response effect, with higher odds of negative outcomes among women who reported heavy use and with continued use during the second and third trimester of gestation. Conclusion: There is an effect of cannabis irrespectively of other illicit drugs and tobacco, despite high heterogeneity and low quality of evidence. There is a need to discuss public policies regarding cannabis' regulation and how it influences its consumption. Future studies should focus on the effects of cannabis's type (medicinal or recreational), timing and dosage during pregnancy on perinatal outcomes.

N2  - This review aims to update and discuss the main challenges in controlling emergent and reemergent forms of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission through organ transplantation, blood products and vertical transmission in endemic and non-endemic areas as well as emergent forms of transmission in endemic countries through contaminated food, currently representing the major cause of acute illness in several countries. As a neglected tropical disease potentially controllable with a major impact on morbimortality and socioeconomic aspects, Chagas disease (CD) was approved at the WHO global plan to interrupt four transmission routes by 2030 (vector/blood transfusion/organ transplant/congenital). Implementation of universal or target screening for CD are highly recommended in blood banks of non-endemic regions; in organ transplants donors in endemic/non-endemic areas as well as in women at risk from endemic areas (reproductive age women/pregnant women-respective babies). Moreover, main challenges for surveillance are the application of molecular methods for identification of infected babies, donor transmitted infection and of live parasites in the food. In addition, the systematic recording of acute/non-acute cases and transmission sources is crucial to establish databases for control and surveillance purposes. Remarkably, antiparasitic treatment of infected reproductive age women and infected babies is essential for the elimination of congenital CD by 2030.

N2  - A multi-epitope protein expressed in a prokaryotic system, including epitopes of Env, Gag, and Tax proteins of both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 was characterized for HTLV-1/2 serological screening. This tool can contribute to support the implementation of public policies to reduce HTLV-1/2 transmission in Brazil, the country with the highest absolute numbers of HTLV-1/2 infected individuals. The chimeric protein was tested in EIA using serum/plasma of HTLV-infected individuals and non-infected ones from four Brazilian states, including the North and Northeast regions (that present high prevalence of HTLV-1/2) and Southeast region (that presents intermediate prevalence rates) depicting different epidemiological context of HTLV-1/2 infection in our country. We enrolled samples from Pará (n = 114), Maranhão (n = 153), Minas Gerais (n = 225) and São Paulo (n = 59) states; they are from blood donors' candidates (Pará and Minas Gerais), pregnant women (Maranhão) and HIV+/high risk for sexually transmitted infection (STI; São Paulo). Among the HTLV-1/2 positive sera, there were co-infections with viral (HTLV-1 + HTLV-2, HIV, HCV, and HBV), bacterial (Treponema pallidum) and parasitic (Trypanosoma cruzi, Schistosma mansoni, Strongyloides stercoralis, Entamoeba coli, E. histolytica, and Endolimax nana) pathogens related to HTLV-1/2 co-morbidities that can contribute to inconclusive diagnostic results. Sera positive for HIV were included among the HTLV-1/2 negative samples. Considering both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2-infected samples from all states and different groups (blood donor candidates, pregnant women, and individuals with high risk for STI), mono or co-infected and HTLV-/HIV+, the test specificity ranged from 90.09 to 95.19% and the sensitivity from 82.41 to 92.36% with high accuracy (ROC AUC = 0.9552). This multi-epitope protein showed great potential to be used in serological screening of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 in different platforms, even taking into account the great regional variation and different profile of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 mono or co-infected individuals.

N2  - Chagas disease (CD) still imposes a heavy burden on most Latin American countries. Vector-borne and mother-to-child transmission cause several thousand new infections per year, and at least 5 million people carry Trypanosoma cruzi. Access to diagnosis and medical care, however, is far from universal. Starting in the 1990s, CD-endemic countries and the Pan American Health Organization-World Health Organization (PAHO-WHO) launched a series of multinational initiatives for CD control-surveillance. An overview of the initiatives' aims, achievements, and challenges reveals some key common themes that we discuss here in the context of the WHO 2030 goals for CD. Transmission of T. cruzi via blood transfusion and organ transplantation is effectively under control. T. cruzi, however, is a zoonotic pathogen with 100+ vector species widely spread across the Americas; interrupting vector-borne transmission seems therefore unfeasible. Stronger surveillance systems are, and will continue to be, needed to monitor and control CD. Prevention of vertical transmission demands boosting current efforts to screen pregnant and childbearing-aged women. Finally, integral patient care is a critical unmet need in most countries. The decades-long experience of the initiatives, in sum, hints at the practical impossibility of interrupting vector-borne T. cruzi transmission in the Americas. The concept of disease control seems to provide a more realistic description of what can in effect be achieved by 2030.

N2  - The Zika virus (ZIKV) caused neurological abnormalities in more than 3500 Brazilian newborns between 2015 and 2020. Data have pointed to oxidative stress in astrocytes as well as to dysregulations in neural cell proliferation and cell cycle as important events accounting for the cell death and neurological complications observed in Congenital Zika Syndrome. Copper imbalance has been shown to induce similar alterations in other pathologies, and disturbances in copper homeostasis have already been described in viral infections. For this reason, we investigated copper homeostasis imbalance as a factor that could contribute to the cytotoxic effects of ZIKV infection in iPSC-derived human astrocytes. Our results show that ZIKV infection leads to a downregulation of one of the transporters mediating copper release, ATP7B protein. We also observed the activation of mechanisms that counteract high copper levels, including the synthesis of copper chaperones and the reduction of the copper importer protein CTR1. Finally, we show that chelator-mediated copper sequestration in ZIKV-infected astrocytes reduces the levels of reactive oxygen species and improves cell viability, but does not change the overall percentage of infected cells. In summary, our results show that copper homeostasis imbalance plays a role in the pathology of ZIKV in astrocytes, indicating that it may also be a factor accounting for the developmental abnormalities in the central nervous system following viral infection. Evaluating micronutrient levels and the use of copper chelators in pregnant women susceptible to ZIKV infection may be promising strategies to manage novel cases of congenital ZIKV syndrome.

N2  - Background: Inadequate gestational weight gain (GWG) is associated with adverse outcomes in maternal and child health and can be enhanced by social inequalities, such as lower education and household food insecurity (HFI). Women are more vulnerable to HFI, which has been associated with negative health effects for pregnant women during the prenatal and puerperal periods, particularly in regard to the aggravation of pregnancy risks. This study investigated the association between sociodemographic characteristics and HFI with respect to adequacy of total GWG among women with high-risk pregnancies. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study that evaluated the total GWG of 169 pregnant women. The women were seen at a public university hospital in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Their sociodemographic and gestational characteristics and the Brazilian Scale of Domestic Food Insecurity were investigated. To estimate the total GWG, the difference between the patient weight at the last prenatal visit and the initial patient weight was verified, with both collected from the medical records of the pregnant women. The classification of the total GWG considered the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) (2009). A multinomial logistic regression model assessed the risk (odds ratio; OR) and confidence intervals (CI 95%)) of insufficient and excessive GWG with exposure to HFI and other covariates (p value <0.05). Results: Insufficient and excessive GWG were observed in 27.8% and 47.9% of the pregnant women, respectively. More than half of the women (74.6%) had a high education level. Exposure to mild HFI occurred in 44.2% of the women. After adjustment, the HFI was not associated with insufficient or excessive GWG. The educational level of women was the only variable significantly associated with a lower risk of GWG insufficiency (OR: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.01–0.89). Conclusions: In this population, higher maternal education was a protective factor against insufficient GWG. We highlight the importance of additional health support and counseling for women in the most vulnerable social conditions, considering the importance of access to information for reducing health risks.

N2  - Background:Pregnant women using antiretrovirals (ARVs) may have persistent vaginal viral shedding, which could be associated with sexual and perinatal HIV transmission. However, there are scant data on vaginal viral load (VVL) in pregnant women with undetectable plasma viral load (PVL).Methods:This study was a post hoc analysis of an open-label randomized trial to evaluate the virologic response of 2 ART regimens. The participants were ART-naive women living with HIV initiating ART regimens between 20 and 36 weeks of pregnancy recruited at 19 clinical sites in 6 countries. Participants were randomized to receive 400 mg of raltegravir 2 times a day or 600 mg of efavirenz 4 times a day in addition to 150 mg of lamivudine and 300 mg of zidovudine 2 times a day. VVL and PVL tests were performed at every study visit. The primary outcome measures were HIV-1 PVL and VVL at maternal study week 4 and rates of perinatal HIV transmission.Results:A total of 408 were enrolled, of whom 323 had VVL samples 4 weeks after enrollment and were included in this analysis. Among women with undetectable/nonquantifiable PVL during ART, the overall rate of quantifiable VVL at week 4 was 2.54% (7/275). Of the 275 with nonquantifiable PVL, 99.1% (115/116) and 96.2% (153/159) had nonquantifiable VVL in the efavirenz and raltegravir arms, respectively. None of the 7 women with quantifiable VVL at the week 4 study visit transmitted HIV to their infants.Conclusions:Detectable VVL in pregnant women with undetectable/nonquantifiable PVL while receiving ART was rare and not associated with perinatal HIV transmission.

N2  - While pregnancy increases the risk for severe COVID-19, the clinical and immunological implications of COVID-19 on maternal-fetal health remain unknown. Here, we present the clinical and immunological landscapes of 93 COVID-19 mothers and 45 of their SARS-CoV-2-exposed infants through comprehensive serum proteomics profiling for >1,400 cytokines of their peripheral and cord blood specimens. Prenatal SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory immune activation. Pregnant women with severe COVID-19 show increased inflammation and unique IFN-λ antiviral signaling, with elevated levels of IFNL1 and IFNLR1. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection re-shapes maternal immunity at delivery, altering the expression of pregnancy complication-associated cytokines, inducing MMP7, MDK, and ESM1 and reducing BGN and CD209. Finally, COVID-19-exposed infants exhibit induction of T cell-associated cytokines (IL33, NFATC3, and CCL21), while some undergo IL-1β/IL-18/CASP1 axis-driven neonatal respiratory distress despite birth at term. Our findings demonstrate COVID-19-induced immune rewiring in both mothers and neonates, warranting long-term clinical follow-up to mitigate potential health risks.

N2  - Background & aims: Most Brazilian women fail to gain weight within recommendations during pregnancy but current guidelines about gestational weight gain was based on North American population analysis. There are no standardized recommendations developed from Brazilian population data, which should be particularly analysed due to ethnic and sociodemographic characteristics. This study analyses the gestational weight gain of Brazilian women with favourable obstetric and neonatal outcomes according to the pre-pregnancy body mass index, considering maternal sociodemographic characteristics. Methods: We analysed data from the Birth in Brazil: national survey into labour and birth study, a nationwide hospital-based cohort carried out in 266 Brazilian hospitals from February/2011 to July 2012, including adult pregnant women who have no chronic diseases and who have single foetal gestation, born alive and without malformation. Favourable obstetric and neonatal outcomes considered were gestational age at birth greater than or equal to 37 and less than 42 weeks, birthweight between 2500 g and 4000 g, and birthweight suitable for gestational age. Sociodemographic characteristics were obtained from medical records and interviews. Weight and height information was obtained from the prenatal card or self-reported. The pre-pregnancy BMI was classified in low weight, normal weight, overweight, obesity I, obesity II, and obesity III. For the missing cases on pre-pregnancy weight or height, body mass index was imputed by multiple imputation prediction model. Gestational weight gain was the difference between the last weight before delivery and the pre-pregnancy weight and was presented as mean and confidence interval, mean and standard deviation, and percentiles distribution (10th to 90th) for each pre-pregnancy body mass index, thus compared to Institute of Medicine recommendations. Results: The analysis included 8184 Brazilian women. The gestational weight gain was lower in women with less favoured social conditions. The mean gestational weight gain according to pre-pregnancy body mass index was within the Institute of Medicine recommendations, except for women with overweight or obesity class I, who have the mean weight gain higher than upper limit of the Institute of Medicine range. Gestational weight gain decreased with an increase in the categories of body mass index; the mean (±standard deviation) were: 15.41 kg (±5.53), 13.54 kg (±4.97), 12.45 kg (±5.86), 9.38 kg (±6.31), 7.15 kg (±6.43), and 5.04 kg (±7.10), for low weight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity I, II and III, respectively. Women had favourable obstetric and neonatal outcomes gaining less, within or more than the recommendations with higher range of variation amongst obesity classes I, II, and III which do not have specific ranges stated in Institute of Medicine guidelines. Conclusion: Brazilian women had favourable obstetric and neonatal outcomes gaining less, within or more than the Institute of Medicine recommendations. We highlight the need of population-based high-quality research to investigate the optimal GWG recommendations for this population.

N2  - The Amazonian indigenous peoples depend on natural resources to live, but human activities’ growing impacts threaten their health and livelihoods. Our objectives were to present the principal results of an integrated and multidisciplinary analysis of the health parameters and assess the mercury (Hg) exposure levels in indigenous populations in the Brazilian Amazon. We carried out a cross-sectional study based on a census of three Munduruku indigenous villages (Sawré Muybu, Poxo Muybu, and Sawré Aboy), located in the Sawré Muybu Indigenous Land, between 29 October and 9 November 2019. The investigation included: (i) sociodemographic characterization of the participants, (ii) health assessment, (iii) genetic polymorphism analysis, (iv) hair mercury determination, and (v) fish mercury determination. We used the logistic regression model with conditional Prevalence Ratio (PR), with the respective 95% confidence intervals (CI95%) to explore factors associated with mercury exposure levels >6.0 ug/g. A total of 200 participants were interviewed. Mercury levels (197 hair samples) ranged from 1.4 to 23.9 ug/g, with significant differences between the villages (Kruskal–Wallis test: 19.9, p-value < 0.001). On average, the general prevalence of Hg exposure > 6.0 ug/g was 57.9%. For participants >12 years old, the Hg exposure >6.0 ug/g showed associated with no regular income (PR: 1.3, CI95%: 1.0–1.8), high blood pressure (PR: 1.6, CI95%: 1.3–2.1) and was more prominent in Sawré Aboy village (PR: 1.8, CI95%: 1.3–2.3). For women of childbearing age, the Hg exposure >6.0 ug/g was associated with high blood pressure (PR: 1.9, CI95%: 1.2–2.3), with pregnancy (PR: 1.5, CI95%: 1.0–2.1) and was more prominent among residents in Poxo Muybu (PR: 1.9, CI95%: 1.0–3.4) and Sawré Aboy (PR: 2.5, CI95%: 1.4–4.4) villages. Our findings suggest that chronic mercury exposure causes harmful effects to the studied indigenous communities, especially considering vulnerable groups of the population, such as women of childbearing age. Lastly, we propose to stop the illegal mining in these areas and develop a risk management plan that aims to ensure the health, livelihoods, and human rights of the indigenous people from Amazon Basin.

N2  - Plants of the genus Cannabis have been gaining attention in medicine. The most outstanding treatments include antispasmodic, analgesic, antiemetic, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory actions. The aim of the study was to describe patents associated with cannabis and cannabinoids as a treatment for pregnant women. A search was carried out on four patent bases: National Institute of Industrial Property, Latipat, Espacenet and Patentscope. The used search keys were “Cannabis”, “Cannabidiol”, “Cannabinoids”, “CBD” and “THC” associated with “pregnant women”. Patents in any language and year were considered. A total of 1,402 patents were found in all the used databases. After reading the title and abstract, patents were excluded if they did not meet the eligibility criteria and/or if they were duplicates, thus leaving 11 patents on the use of cannabis and/or cannabinoids as treatment in pregnant women. A critical analysis was carried out. All selected patents were from the Asian continent (China), focusing on traditional Chinese medicine for treating various possible changes during pregnancy and also for diseases prevention in the postpartum period. It was found that the main causes for the need of such treatments were related to spleen deficiencies, inability and/or moisture stagnation. Finally, the vast majority of treatments used Cannabis fruits associated with other plants. Given the above, patents related to cannabis and cannabinoids for the treatment of pregnant women in the peri and postnatal periods were found to be associated with traditional Chinese medicine.

N2  - Background: Despite high seroprevalence of asymptomatic infection in humans, toxoplasmosis can manifest as a severe systemic disease, as occurs in the congenital infection. Here we evaluate the seroprevalence of Toxoplasma infection among pregnant women in a highly urbanized area of Brazil. Methods: A robust seroepidemiological study was conducted using laboratory databases of anti-Toxoplasma gondii serological results together with information on age, month/year of diagnosis and place of residence of pregnant women in the public health system of the city of Juiz de Fora, Brazil. Results: Of 5895 pregnant women analysed, 54.7% showed seronegativity and 44.4% showed seropositivity for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii. This seropositivity rate increased to 68.3% when only considering participants from rural areas. Multivariate analysis revealed higher odds of being seropositive associated with age (odds ratio [OR] 1.06 [confidence interval {CI} 1.05 to 1.07]) and with living in rural areas (OR 2.96 [CI 1.64 to 5.36]). The spatial distribution of IgG seropositivity indicated a higher prevalence concentrated in rural and peripheral neighbourhoods. Conclusions: This is the first report to use spatial analysis to show a cluster of Toxoplasma infection in rural and peripheral neighbourhoods of a highly urbanized municipality, which highlights the need for adequate healthcare actions to be implemented for women living in these areas.

N2  - There are some reports and case series addressing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections during pregnancy in upper income countries, but there are few data on pregnant women with comorbid conditions in low and middle income Countries. This study evaluated the proportion and the maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women with comorbidities. Participants were recruited consecutively in order of admission to a maternity for pregnant women with comorbidities. Sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory data were prospectively collected during hospitalization. Pregnant women were screened at entry: nasopharyngeal swabs were tested by RT-PCR; serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies against spike protein by ELISA. From April to June 2020, 115 eligible women were included in the study. The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 28.7%. The rate of obesity was 60.9%, vascular hypertension 40.0%, and HIV 21.7%. The most common clinical presentations were ageusia (21.2%), anosmia (18.2%), and fever (18.2%). Prematurity was higher among mothers who had a SARS-CoV-2 infection based on RT-PCR. There were two cases of fetal demise. We found a high proportion of COVID-19 among pregnant women with comorbidities. This underscores the importance of antenatal care during the pandemic to implement universal SARS-CoV-2 screening, precautionary measures, and the rollout of vaccination programs for pregnant women.

N2  - Zika virus (ZIKV) caused global concern due to Brazil's unexpected epidemic, and it was associated with congenital microcephaly and other gestational intercurrences. The study aimed to analyze the placenta morphometric changes of ZIKV-infected pregnant women (ZIKV group; n = 23) compared to placentas of HIV-infected (HIV group; n = 24) and healthy pregnant women (N-control group; n = 22). It also analyzed the relationship between the morphometric results and pathological alterations on conventional microscopy, gestational trimester of infection, and presence of the congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). There was a significant increase in area (p = 0.0172), as well as a higher number of knots (p = 0.0027), sprouts (p < 0.0001), and CD163 +Hofbauer cells (HCs) (p < 0.0001) in the ZIKV group compared to the N-control group, suggesting that villous dysmaturity and HCs hyperplasia could be associated with ZIKV infections. The HIV group had a higher area (p < 0.0001), perimeter (p = 0.0001), sprouts (p < 0.0001), and CD163 + HCs (p < 0.0001) compared to the N-control group, demonstrating that the morphometric abnormalities found in the ZIKV and HIV group are probably similar. However, when ZIKV and HIV groups are compared, it was observed a higher number of sprouts (p = 0.0066) and CD163+ HCs (p < 0.0001) in the first one, suggesting that placental ZIKV congenital changes could be more pronounced.

N2  - The dengue surveillance system in Brazil has registered changes in the disease's morbidity and mortality profile over successive epidemics. Vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women, have been particularly hard hit. This study assessed the quality of notifications of dengue cases among pregnant women and non-pregnant women of childbearing age in Brazil, in addition to discussing the factors associated with arbovirus infection in the group of pregnant women. We carried out a retrospective study of cases registered in the national arbovirus surveillance system between 2007 and 2017. The indicator for assessing quality was incompleteness. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between dengue during pregnancy and sociodemographic, epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory variables. The incompleteness of the data in the notification form for dengue cases in women of childbearing age and pregnant women indicates a significant loss of information. Dengue was shown to be positively associated with Social Determinants of Health in both groups, with more severe effects among pregnant women. The incompleteness of the data can limit the quality of information from the notification system and the national assessment of the situation of the disease in women of childbearing age and pregnant women.

N2  - Since the beginning of the current coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), there has been great concern over a disease that has spread rapidly in several countries worldwide, with the result of several deaths, including deaths of pregnant women. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a literature review on placental changes in infected pregnant women and/or asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 during pregnancy, aiming at the possible vertical transmission. A systematic collection was carried out on the effects of that COVID-19 can cause directly and/or indirectly to pregnancy and the placenta in the following databases: Pubmed, Science Direct, Scielo, Lilacs, and Web of Science. For search, the following descriptors were used: placenta, pregnant woman, COVID-19, maternal–fetal. The results indicate transplacental transmission in some cases reviewed in many reports from this study. The presence of the virus was seen in the amniotic fluid, umbilical cord, and peripheral blood. Finally, pathological studies suggest that there are morphological changes related to infection in the placentas. We can conclude that, based on the researched material, there is little evidence of transplacental vertical viral transmission and its respective morphological changes related to viral infection in the placenta.

N2  - Depression and anxiety are common during pregnancy, but little is known about the influence of these disorders on gestational weight gain (GWG). Data from a prospective cohort of pregnant women followed in a public healthcare center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were used to evaluate the association of depression, anxiety, and suicide risk with GWG. GWG was evaluated at 5-13, 20-26, 30-36, and 37-42 weeks, and GWG adequacy was determined. Statistical analyses included linear mixed-effect models and Poisson regression. We evaluated 206 women, in which 15% (n = 31) presented major depressive disorder, 19.4% (n = 34) suicide risk and 10% (n = 21) generalized anxiety disorder at baseline. Women with depression at the first trimester, persistent depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms at the second trimester presented significantly lower rates of GWG per week compared to those without depression or anxiety, respectively. Persistent depressive symptoms represented a 2.40 (95% CI 1.20; 4.81; p = 0.013) increase in the risk of insufficient GWG. There was no significant association between generalized anxiety disorder or suicide risk with GWG. The presence of depression, depressive symptoms, and anxiety during pregnancy were associated with lower GWG rates. Persistent depressive symptoms during pregnancy were directly associated with insufficient GWG.

N2  - Background: HIV incidence among women of reproductive age and vertical HIV transmission rates remain high in Latin America. We, therefore, quantified HIV care continuum barriers and outcomes among pregnant women living with HIV (WLWH) in Latin America. Methods: WLWH (aged ≥16 years) enrolling at Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet) sites from 2000 to 2017 who had HIV diagnosis, pregnancy and delivery dates contributed. Logistic regression produced adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for retention in care (≥2 visits ≥3 months apart) and virological suppression (viral load <200 copies/mL) 12 months after pregnancy outcome. Cumulative incidences of loss to follow-up (LTFU) postpartum were estimated using Cox regression. Evidence of HIV status at pregnancy confirmation was the exposure. Covariates included pregnancy outcome (born alive vs. others); AIDS diagnosis prior to delivery; CD4, age, HIV-1 RNA and cART regimen at first delivery and CCASAnet country. Results: Among 579 WLWH, median postpartum follow-up was 4.34 years (IQR 1.91, 7.35); 459 (79%) were HIV-diagnosed before pregnancy confirmation, 445 (77%) retained in care and 259 (45%) virologically suppressed at 12 months of postpartum. Cumulative incidence of LTFU was 21% by 12 months and 40% by five years postpartum. Those HIV-diagnosed during pregnancy had lower odds of retention (aOR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.97) and virological suppression (aOR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.82) versus those HIV-diagnosed before. Conclusion: HIV diagnosis during pregnancy was associated with poorer 12-month retention and virological suppression. Young women should be tested and linked to HIV care earlier to narrow these disparities.

N2  - Background Serological diagnosis of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is challenging because of the antibody cross-reactivity among flaviviruses. At the same time, the role of Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) is limited by the low proportion of symptomatic infections and the low average viral load. Here, we compared the diagnostic performance of commercially available IgM, IgAM, and IgG ELISAs in sequential samples during the ZIKV and chikungunya (CHIKV) epidemics and co-circulation of dengue virus (DENV) in Brazil and Venezuela. Methodology/Principal findings Acute (day of illness 1–5) and follow-up (day of illness ≥ 6) blood samples were collected from nine hundred and seven symptomatic patients enrolled in a prospective multicenter study between June 2012 and August 2016. Acute samples were tested by RT-PCR for ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV. Acute and follow-up samples were tested for IgM, IgAM, and IgG antibodies to ZIKV using commercially available ELISAs. Among follow-up samples with a RT-PCR confirmed ZIKV infection, anti-ZIKV IgAM sensitivity was 93.5% (43/46), while IgM and IgG exhibited sensitivities of 30.3% (10/33) and 72% (18/25), respectively. An additional 24% (26/109) of ZIKV infections were detected via IgAM seroconversion in ZIKV/DENV/ CHIKV RT-PCR negative patients. The specificity of anti-ZIKV IgM was estimated at 93% and that of IgAM at 85%. Conclusions/Significance Our findings exemplify the challenges of the assessment of test performance for ZIKV serological tests in the real-world setting, during co-circulation of DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV. However, we can also demonstrate that the IgAM immunoassay exhibits superior sensitivity to detect ZIKV RT-PCR confirmed infections compared to IgG and IgM immunoassays. The IgAM assay also proves to be promising for detection of anti-ZIKV seroconversions in sequential samples, both in ZIKV PCR-positive as well as PCR-negative patients, making this a candidate assay for serological monitoring of pregnant women in future ZIKV outbreaks.

N2  - Despite great advances in our knowledge of the consequences of Zika virus to human health, many questions remain unanswered, and results are often inconsistent. The small sample size of individual studies has limited inference about the spectrum of congenital Zika manifestations and the prognosis of affected children. The Brazilian Zika Cohorts Consortium addresses these limitations by bringing together and harmonizing epidemiological data from a series of prospective cohort studies of pregnant women with rash and of children with microcephaly and/or other manifestations of congenital Zika. The objective is to estimate the absolute risk of congenital Zika manifestations and to characterize the full spectrum and natural history of the manifestations of congenital Zika in children with and without microcephaly. This protocol describes the assembly of the Consortium and protocol for the Individual Participant Data Meta-analyses (IPD Meta-analyses). The findings will address knowledge gaps and inform public policies related to Zika virus. The large harmonized dataset and joint analyses will facilitate more precise estimates of the absolute risk of congenital Zika manifestations among Zika virus-infected pregnancies and more complete descriptions of its full spectrum, including rare manifestations. It will enable sensitivity analyses using different definitions of exposure and outcomes, and the investigation of the sources of heterogeneity between studies and regions.

N2  - Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) can cause life-threatening diseases for which there are no effective treatments. Prevention of HTLV-1 infection requires massive testing of pregnant women, blood for transfusion, and organs for transplantation, as well as safe sex. In this context, serological assays are widely used for monitoring HTLV-1 infections. Despite the necessity for recombinant antigens to compose serological tests, there is little information available on procedures to produce recombinant HTLV-1/2 antigens for serological diagnostic purposes. In this work, we tested a series of genetic constructions to select those more amenable for production in bacterial systems. To overcome the constraints in expressing sections of viral envelope proteins in bacteria, we have used the p24 segment of the gag protein as a scaffold to display the immunogenic regions of gp46 and gp21. Nine recombinant antigenic proteins derived from HTLV-1 and five derived from HTLV-2 were successfully purified. The HTLV-1 antigens showed high efficiency in discriminating HTLV-positive samples from HTLV-negative samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Interestingly, HTLV-1-positive samples showed a high level of cross-reaction with HTLV-2 antigens. This finding is explained by the high sequence conservation between the structural proteins of these two highly related viruses. In summary, the results presented in this work provide a detailed description of the methods used to produce recombinant HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 antigens, and they demonstrate that the HTLV-1 antigens show strong potential for serological diagnosis of HTLV-1 infections.

N2  - The absence of an adequate animal model for studies has limited the understanding of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) in humans during the outbreak in America. In this study, we used squirrel monkeys (Saimiri collinsi), a neotropical primate (which mimics the stages of human pregnancy), as a model of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Seven pregnant female squirrel monkeys were experimentally infected at three different gestational stages, and we were able reproduce a broad range of clinical manifestations of ZIKV lesions observed in newborn humans. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of early-infected newborns (2/4) revealed damage to various areas of the brain and ZIKV antigens in the cytoplasm of neurons and glial cells, indicative of CZS. The changes caused by ZIKV infection were intrauterine developmental delay, ventriculomegaly, simplified brain gyri, vascular impairment and neuroprogenitor cell dysfunction. Our data show that the ZIKV infection outcome in squirrel monkeys is similar to that in humans, indicating that this model can be used to help answer questions about the effect of ZIKV infection on neuroembryonic development and the morphological changes induced by CZS.

N2  - Exposure to stressful environmental events during the perinatal period can increase vulnerability to psychopathologies that cause neuroendocrine changes associated with deficits in emotional behavior that can appear early in life. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a frequent, chronic, and disabling disorder that negatively impacts the emotional, social, and cognitive behaviors of affected individuals. Thus, we induced PTSD in pregnant rats by applying inescapable footshocks and then investigated the behavioral parameters similar to anxiety in offspring at prepubertal age, in addition to the plasma levels of maternal and offspring corticosterone and expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the offspring's hippocampus. With the dams, maternal behavior, open field, and object recognition tests were performed. With the male and female offspring, we performed the following: quantification of ultrasonic vocalizations, elevated plus-maze test, evaluation of exploratory activity in the open field, and hole board test, as well as plasma corticosterone measurements and Western blotting for GR. Our results showed that gestational PTSD affected maternal behavior, led to anxiety-like symptoms, increased corticosterone levels, and increased GR expression in the offspring's hippocampus. Therefore, our data can contribute to the understanding of the onset of early (childhood and juvenile/pre-pubertal phases) anxiety owing to exposure to a traumatic event during the gestation period.

N2  - Most animal model studies of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) were performed in males. Thus, little is known about the mechanisms underlying disease progression in females. Here, we searched for potential influences of sex and environment on gestational valproic acid-induced behavioral abnormalities using hippocampal-dependent tasks, and on number and morphometry of microglia of the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (Mol-DG). We compared male and females BALB/c control mice with BALB/c mice gestationally exposed to VPA with regards to exploratory activity and risk assessment in novel environments. Pregnant females and males on gestational day 12.5 received VPA in saline (600 mg/kg body weight) or an equal volume of saline by gavage. After weaning, female and male offspring were housed separately either in standard laboratory cages (SE) or enriched cages (EE). At 5 months of age, these mice underwent behavioral testing and had their brains processed for microglia IBA1 immunolabeling. Compared with control mice, VPA-exposed mice exhibited abnormal behavior in exploring novel environments and assessing risk, and these effects were significantly greater in females than in males and less intense among mice from enriched cages. Three-way ANOVA revealed that environment, sex and valproic acid conditions interacted and altered the behavior results. Microglia number and volume of the Mol-DG were significantly higher in VPA-exposed groups raised in standard cages. The results of counting the intersects of microglia branching on Sholl's circles analyzed with permutational MANOVA, demonstrated that in comparison with males, there was a greater reduction in the number of intersections in females raised in standard cages. These findings suggest that the increased microglia and morphological changes might be associated with behavioral dysfunction in ASD. Moreover, the somatomotor and cognitive stimulation of environmental enrichment started at weaning may be beneficial for reducing behavioral abnormalities and reduction of microglia response in adulthood.

N2  - During the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil (2015-2016), the clinical manifestations associated with its infection were complex and included miscarriage and congenital malformations, not previously described. In this study, we evaluated the prenatal conditions of pregnant female squirrel monkeys (Saimiri collinsi) infected during different gestational thirds (GTs) and assessed all clinical aspects, diagnostic imaging, viremia and the immune response. In our study, 75% of the infected animals in the 1st GT group had significant clinical manifestations, such as miscarriage and prolonged viremia associated with a late immune response. Consequently, their neonates showed fetal neuropathology, such as cerebral hemorrhage, lissencephaly or malformations of the brain grooves, ventriculomegaly, and craniofacial malformations. Thus, our study demonstrated the relevance of pregnant squirrel monkeys as a model for the study of ZIKV infection in neonates due to the broad clinical manifestations presented, including the typical congenital Zika syndrome manifestations described in humans.

N2  - Long-term exposure to high concentrations of fluoride (F) can damage mineralized and soft tissues such as bones, liver, kidney, intestine, and nervous system of adult rats. The high permeability of the blood–brain barrier and placenta to F during pregnancy and lactation may be critical to neurological development. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of F exposure during pregnancy and lactation on molecular processes and oxidative biochemistry of offspring rats’ hippocampus. Pregnant Wistar rats were randomly assigned into 3 groups in accordance with the drinking water received: G1 – deionized water (control); G2 – 10 mg/L of F and G3 – 50 mg/L of F. The exposure to fluoridated water began on the first day of pregnancy and lasted until the 21st day of breastfeeding (when the offspring rats were weaned). Blood plasma samples of the offspring rats were collected to determine F levels. Hippocampi samples were collected for oxidative biochemistry analyses through antioxidant capacity against peroxyl (ACAP), lipid peroxidation (LPO), and nitrite (NO2−) levels. Also, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression (RT-qPCR) and proteomic profile analyses were performed. The results showed that exposure to both F concentrations during pregnancy and lactation increased the F bioavailability, triggered redox imbalance featured by a decrease of ACAP, increase of LPO and NO2− levels, BDNF overexpression and changes in the hippocampus proteome. These findings raise novel questions regarding potential repercussions on the hippocampus structure and functioning in the different cognitive domains.

N2  - Objectives: Using dynamic transmission models we evaluated the health and cost outcomes of adding acellular pertussis (aP) vaccination of pregnant women to infant vaccination in three Brazilian states that represent different socioeconomic conditions. The primary objective was to determine whether the same model structure could be used to represent pertussis disease dynamics in differing socioeconomic conditions. Methods: We tested three model structures (SIR, SIRS, SIRSIs) to represent population-level transmission in three socio-demographically distinct Brazilian states: São Paulo, Paraná and Bahia. Two strategies were evaluated: infant wP vaccination alone versus maternal aP immunization plus infant wP vaccination. Model projections for 2014–2029 include outpatient and inpatient pertussis cases, pertussis deaths, years of life lost, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost, and costs (in 2014 USD) of maternal aP vaccination, infant vaccination, and pertussis medical treatment. Incremental cost per DALY averted is presented from the perspective of the Brazilian National Health System. Results: Based on goodness-of-fit statistics, the SIRSIs model fit best, although it had only a modest improvement in statistical quantitative assessments relative to the SIRS model. For all three Brazilian states, maternal aP immunization led to higher costs but also saved infant lives and averted DALYs. The 2014 USD cost/DALY averted was $3068 in Sao Paulo, $2962 in Parana, and $2022 in Bahia. These results were robust in sensitivity analyses with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios exceeding per capita gross regional product only when the probability that a pertussis case is reported was assumed higher than base case implying more overt cases and deaths and therefore more medical costs. Conclusions: The same model structure fit all three states best, supporting the idea that the disease behaves similarly across different socioeconomic conditions. We also found that immunization of pregnant women with aP is cost-effective in diverse Brazilian states.

N2  - Chagas disease (CD) is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and it is mainly acquired through the vector route, however, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are implicated in the spread of the illness worldwide. The congenital route can occur at any stage of pregnancy and its frequency varies. In the Federal District, in Brazil, the frequency of T. cruzi infection in pregnant women and their offspring has not been updated. Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in pregnant women and the rate of congenital transmission in the Federal District. A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of T. cruzi from 2014 to 2016 in the population of pregnant women attended by the public health service throughout the Federal District and a descriptive cohort for the evaluation of congenital transmission. During the study, prenatal data of 98,895 women were consulted and pregnant women registered in 2016, presenting with positive T. cruzi serology, were part of the descriptive cohort. The estimated prevalence of T. cruzi infection in the three years was 0.19% and the congenital transmission rate was 1/40 (2.5%). Our results have shown that, although the main routes of transmission of CD have been interrupted, there is still a risk of congenital transmission in the Federal District. This present study highlights the need for the continuous implementation of a screening program for pregnant women and timely treatment of infected newborns and children.

N2  - This study describes difficulties in the monitoring of a child born during an oral outbreak of Chagas disease, in which there are several indications that the transmission occurred through the congenital route: 1. the mother was in the third trimester of pregnancy when she was infected; 2. She presented high parasitemia at the time of delivery; 3. In both, the mother and her daughter, T. cruzi was classified as DTU TcIV. The parasites were not found in the blood at birth and the infection was detected only three months later in an asymptomatic infant. As the mother and her child live in a highly endemic area, vector transmission could not be excluded during this period.

N2  - Background: Dolutegravir has been widely available in Brazil since 2017. Following the signal that infants born to women with dolutegravir exposure at conception in Botswana had a higher risk of neural tube defects (NTDs), public health leaders initiated a national investigation to evaluate periconception dolutegravir exposure among all pregnant Brazilian women with HIV and its potential association with risk of NTDs, stillbirth, or miscarriage before 22 weeks (also called spontaneous abortion). Methods: In this retrospective, observational, national, cohort study, we identified all women with pregnancies and possible dolutegravir exposure within 8 weeks of estimated date of conception between Jan 1, 2017, and May 31, 2018, and approximately 3:1 matched pregnant women exposed to efavirenz between Jan 1, 2015, and May 31, 2018, using the Brazilian antiretroviral therapy database. We did detailed chart reviews for identified women. The primary outcomes were NTD and a composite measure of NTD, stillbirth, or miscarriage. NTD incidences were calculated with 95% CI. The composite outcome was examined with logistic regression using propensity score matching weights to balance confounders. Findings: Of 1427 included women, 382 were exposed to dolutegravir within 8 weeks of estimated date of conception. During pregnancy, 183 (48%) of 382 dolutegravir-exposed and 465 (44%) of 1045 efavirenz-exposed women received folic acid supplementation. There were 1452 birth outcomes. There were no NTDs in either dolutegravir-exposed (0, 95% CI 0–0·0010) or efavirenz-exposed groups (0, 95% CI 0–0·0036). There were 23 (6%) stillbirths or miscarriages in 384 dolutegravir-exposed fetuses and 28 (3%) in the 1068 efavirenz-exposed fetuses (p=0·0037). Logistic regression models did not consistently indicate an association between dolutegravir exposure and risk of stillbirths or miscarriages. After study closure, two confirmed NTD outcomes in fetuses with periconception dolutegravir exposure were reported to public health officials. An updated estimate of NTD incidence incorporating these cases and the estimated number of additional dolutegravir-exposed pregnancies between Jan 1, 2015 and Feb 28, 2019, is 0·0018 (95% CI 0·0005–0·0067). Interpretation: Neither dolutegravir nor efavirenz exposure was associated with NTDs in our national cohort; incidence of NTDs is probably well under 1% in dolutegravir-exposed HIV-positive women but still slightly above HIV-uninfected women (0·06%) in Brazil. Funding: The Brazilian Ministry of Health and the United States’ National Institutes of Health.

N2  - Objective: To analyze the characteristics and the factors associated with mortality of cases hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome in a health region, in pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. Methods: A retrospective documentary study of epidemiological surveillance carried out with secondary data from the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System, regarding the cases of patients belonging to a health region of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Results: During the pandemic period, there was an increase in the number of hospitalizations and deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome, in addition to differences between sociodemographic and clinical-epidemiological characteristics. In both periods, the age and the use of invasive ventilatory support were the predictors of hospital mortality. The mortality in the pandemic period was also associated with male gender, presence of risk factors, admission to an intensive care unit, use of non-invasive ventilatory support, and infection by COVID-19. Conclusions: In 2020, the detection rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome was 21 times higher than in 2019 and new symptoms, such as anosmia and ageusia, were included in their investigation. In both periods evaluated, elderly patients and patients on invasive mechanical ventilation had a higher risk of mortality. With the pandemic, there was a greater number of hospitalizations and factors associated with mortality.

N2  - Objectives: Severe consequences of mother-to-child transmission of syphilis and high increasing incidence of congenital syphilis remains an important public health problem in Brazil. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a rapid point-of-care test (RT) and treatment of positive mothers immediately compared with a laboratory-based standard test (ST) with treatment at next follow-up visit. Methods: A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between antenatal syphilis screening strategies. The model was built with lifetime horizon from Brazilian health system perspective using 3% and 5% discount rates. A hypothetical cohort of pregnant women at reproductive age were used in the model. Health outcomes: low birth weight, stillbirths, neonatal deaths and congenital syphilis were estimated in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost. Microcosting study and secondary data provided parameters of direct medical costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken. Results: For base case, the mean cost per pregnant woman screened was $2.63 (RT) and $2.48 (ST), respectively. Maternal syphilis was associated with a loss of 0.0043 DALYs (RT) and 0.0048 DALYs (ST) per mother screened. Expected value of incremental cost per DALY averted was $298.08. After 10 000 probabilistic sensitivity analysis model runs, incremental cost and health benefits were $0.15 (95% credible interval –1.56 to 1.92) and 0.00042 DALYs (95% credible interval –0.0036 to 0.0044), respectively, with a mean ICER of $357.44 per DALY. Screening with RT has a 58% chance of being the optimal strategy at a threshold of $3,200 per DALY. Conclusions: In Brazil, antenatal screening with syphilis RT and immediate treatment is likely to be cost-effective compared with standard screening and must be prioritized in local settings.

N2  - Saxitoxins (STXs) are neurotoxins produced by cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates, and they are primarily known to block voltage-gated sodium channels in neurons. The present study aimed to obtain further information regarding the effects of these toxins on neurodevelopment by investigating the responses of murine subventricular zone (SVZ) neural progenitors to STXs. An in vitro neonatal mouse SVZ explant model was exposed to different concentrations of toxic cyanobacterial extracts to evaluate the migration and differentiation of SVZ-derived progenitor cells. To test the ability of STX to cross the placental barrier, pregnant mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of STXs (7.5 μg/kg body weight) on gestational day fifteen. Immunocytochemistry was performed to detect proliferating and differentiating progenitors, including oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). It was found that specific proliferation of OPCs was significantly increased, but there was no corresponding increase in the number of differentiated oligodendrocytes, which may indicate a negative effect on the maturation process of these cells. Additionally, the data showed that STXs crossed the placental barrier. Thus, STXs can be considered a potential risk to fetal neurodevelopment.

N2  - Few studies have compared the clinical efficacy and adverse events of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimens in pregnant women seeking obstetrical care. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy (virus load response), adverse events, and obstetrical and neonatal outcomes of three different regimens of cART in HIV-infected pregnant women initiating treatment in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This was a retrospective cohort study of cART-naive pregnant women who initiated either ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (atazanavir or lopinavir), efavirenz, or raltegravir plus a backbone regimen. From 2014 to 2018, 390 pregnant women were followed over time. At baseline, the median viral load (VL) for HIV was 4.1 log copies/ml. Among participants who received cART for 2 to 7 weeks, the VL decline was greater for raltegravir (2.24 log copies/ml) than for efavirenz or protease inhibitors (P < 0.001). Virologic suppression was achieved in 87% of women on raltegravir near delivery versus 73% on efavirenz and 70% on protease inhibitors (P = 0.011). Patients on raltegravir achieved virologic suppression faster than those on other regimens (P = 0.019). Overall, the HIV perinatal infection rate was 1.5%. This clinical study compared three potent and well-tolerated cART regimens and demonstrated that a higher proportion of participants on raltegravir achieved an undetectable HIV VL near delivery (P = 0.011) compared to the other arms. These findings suggest that raltegravir-containing regimens are optimal regimens for women with HIV initiating treatment late in pregnancy.

N2  - Objectives: Screening for genes differentially expressed in placental tissues, aiming to identify transcriptional signatures that may be involved in ZIKV congenital pathogenesis. Methods: Transcriptome data from placental tissues of pregnant women naturally infected with Zika virus during the third trimester were compared to those from women who tested negative for Zika infection. The findings were validated using both a cell culture model and an immunohistochemistry/morphological analysis of naturally infected placental tissues. Results: Transcriptome analysis revealed that Zika virus infection induces downregulation of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) gene, an essential factor for fetal development. The Caco-2 cell culture model that constitutively expresses IGF2 was used for the transcriptome validation. Asiatic and African Zika virus strains infection caused downregulated IGF2 gene expression in Caco-2 cells, whereas other flaviviruses, such as dengue serotype 1, West Nile and wild-type yellow fever viruses, had no effect on this gene expression. Immunohistochemical assays on decidual tissues corroborated our transcriptome analysis, showing that IGF2 is reduced in the decidua of Zika virus-infected women. Conclusions: Our results draw attention to IGF2 modulation in uterine tissues, and this finding is expected to support future studies on strategies to ameliorate the harmful effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy.

N2  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is associated with a congenital syndrome. Although the virus can be detected in human placental tissue and sexual transmission has been verified, it is not clear how the virus reaches the fetus. Despite the emerging severity caused by ZIKV infection, no specific prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment is available. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness antiviral of nitazoxanide (NTZ) in two important congenital transmission targets: (i) a primary culture of human placental chorionic cells, and (ii) human cervical epithelial cells (C33-A) infected with Brazilian ZIKV strain. Initially, NTZ activity was screened in ZIKV infected Vero cells under different treatment regimens with non-toxic drug concentrations for 48 h. Antiviral effect was found only when the treatment was carried out after the viral inoculum. A strong effect against the dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) was also observed suggesting the possibility of treating other Flaviviruses. Additionally, it was shown that the treatment did not reduce the production of infectious viruses in insect cells (C6/36) infected with ZIKV, indicating that the activity of this drug is also related to host factors. Importantly, we demonstrated that NTZ treatment in chorionic and cervical cells caused a reduction of infected cells in a dose-dependent manner and decreased viral loads in up to 2 logs. Pre-clinical in vitro testing evidenced excellent therapeutic response of infected chorionic and cervical cells and point to future NTZ activity investigation in ZIKV congenital transmission models with the perspective of possible repurposing of NTZ to treat Zika fever, especially in pregnant women.

N2  - Toxoplasmosis in pregnant women can cause significant morbidity and mortality in the fetus, which may be mitigated by early diagnosis and treatment. Social factors have also been related to the risk of developing the congenital form of toxoplasmosis, since some of these factors interfere directly in the quality of prenatal care. This study aimed to describe the clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data of pregnant women diagnosed with toxoplasmosis and their newborns followed up at a referral hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This was descriptive cohort study of 334 pregnant women with toxoplasmosis followed from May 2014 to December 2017. We conducted interviews to assess knowledge about the disease and its preventive measures, analyzed clinical and laboratory data during antenatal visits, and collected data from the newborns’ medical charts. Results: This was a predominantly low-income women cohort study, with little schooling, mainly referred from public health services late in pregnancy (178; 53.3%), in the second and third trimesters (286; 85.6%). Diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis had not been confirmed in 171 cases (51.2%). Out of 183 (54.9%) women who had initiated treatment at the original health services, 45 (24.6%) received an incorrect prescription. Seventy-two amniocenteses were performed, with positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in the amniotic fluid in two cases (2.8%). Congenital toxoplasmosis at birth was identified in eight newborns (5.4%). Conclusion: Late referral to specialized medical services, inadequate toxoplasmosis management at the original prenatal care services, and social vulnerabilities are contributing factors to the persistent occurrence of congenital toxoplasmosis cases.

N2  - This commentary describes the creation of the Zika Virus Individual Participant Data Consortium, a global collaboration to address outstanding questions in Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemiology through conducting an individual participant data meta-analysis (IPD-MA). The aims of the IPD-MA are to (1) estimate the absolute and relative risks of miscarriage, fetal loss, and short- and long-term sequelae of fetal exposure; (2) identify and quantify the relative importance of different sources of heterogeneity (e.g., immune profiles, concurrent flavivirus infection) for the risk of adverse fetal, infant, and child outcomes among infants exposed to ZIKV in utero; and (3) develop and validate a prognostic model for the early identification of high-risk pregnancies and inform communication between health care providers and their patients and public health interventions (e.g., vector control strategies, antenatal care, and family planning programs). By leveraging data from a diversity of populations across the world, the IPD-MA will provide a more precise estimate of the risk of adverse ZIKV-related outcomes within clinically relevant subgroups and a quantitative assessment of the generalizability of these estimates across populations and settings. The ZIKV IPD Consortium effort is indicative of the growing recognition that data sharing is a central component of global health security and outbreak response.

N2  - Purpose: Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of folate inadequacy (POFI) according to life stage, socio-economic status, and geographical regions after the mandatory fortification of wheat and maize flour in Brazil. Methods: This was a population-based study. Data from two non-consecutive food records from the National Dietary Survey/Household Budget Survey 2008–2009 were used to estimate the usual dietary folate intake in µg dietary folate equivalents (DFEs). The National Cancer Institute method was used to account for within-person variance and the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) cut-point method was used to calculate the POFI. The survey included 32,749 individuals, 15,700 males and 17,049 females, over 10 years old. Pregnant women, lactating women, and individuals with unreliable energy intake data were excluded. Results: Overall POFI was 31.5% and mean dietary folate intake was 411.1 µg DFE. The lowest POFI occurred in the youngest age group of 10–13 years in both sexes, while the highest POFI was observed in the group ≥ 71 years. In women of childbearing age, POFI was around 32%. The lowest income strata had the highest POFI. The most developed regions (South and Southeast) had the lowest POFI compared to less developed regions. Conclusions: Our data show that folate inadequacy is still prevalent in Brazil mainly in low-income groups and less developed regions. Actions need to be taken to ensure that women of childbearing age, who presented a high prevalence of inadequate folate intake, achieve the recommended daily intake of 400 µg DFEs.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal toxoplasmosis remains a neglected disease worldwide and few government programs focusing on its prevention are available. Success in these programs has been extensively reported in the literature, yet the strategies used for their implementation, as a model for such actions in different communities, have not been described. OBJECTIVES: To describe the aspects of prenatal care strategies in 13 municipalities within the regional healthcare unit of Araçatuba, in the northwestern region of the state of São Paulo in 2017, focusing on congenital toxoplasmosis. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive study on prenatal healthcare within the Brazilian National Health Sys-tem, in 13 participating municipalities. METHODS: Data on serological tests, referral clinics, notifications, healthcare strategies, health education and drugs for infected children were requested through a questionnaire that was sent via e-mail to people responsible for healthcare services in these municipalities. RESULTS: Major differences relating to diagnoses, reference outpatient clinics, notifications, health education and healthcare and drugs for infected children were reported among the prenatal strategies of these 13 municipal healthcare services. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of standardized prenatal strategy in the study area may compromise the prevention of infection. However, our identification of each aspect of prenatal care corroborates the need to implement a healthcare surveillance program relating to congenital toxoplasmosis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and is endemic of the Americas. The control of the disease is restricted to toxic and potentially teratogenic drugs, which limit the use during pregnancy. The use of food supplementation offers a safe and low-cost form to alleviate Chagas disease symptoms, mostly in areas with alimentary risk. For example, zinc demonstrates positive effects in immune response, including in Chagas disease during pregnancy. PURPOSE: This study describes the innate response in pregnant rats chronically infected with T. cruzi and supplemented with zinc. METHODS: Pregnant female Wistar rats, infected with T. cruzi, were treated with 20 mg/kg/day zinc sulfate and euthanized on the 18th day. Samples (plasma, splenocytes, and peritoneal exudate) were collected and several immune parameters (nitric oxide, RT1B, CD80/CD86, MCP-1, CD11b/c, NK/NKT, IL-2, IL-10, INF-cc, and apoptosis) evaluated. RESULTS: Under Zinc supplementation and/or T. cruzi infection, the gestation developed normally. Several innate immune parameters such as RT1B, CD80/CD86, MCP-1 expressing lymphocytes, IL-2, and IL-17 were positively altered, whereas nitric oxide, CD11b/c, NK/NKT, apoptosis, INF-γ, and corticosterone demonstrated a pro-pregnancy pattern. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that zinc has diverse effects on immune response during pregnancy. An anti-T. cruzi immunity, as well as a pro-gestation response, were observed after zinc supplementation. The complete comprehension of zinc supplementation in pregnancy will base an adequate strategy to alleviate Chagas disease symptoms and propagation, especially for populations from endemic areas.

N2  - Background: Retrospective observational studies suggest that transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi does not occur in treated women when pregnant later in life. The level of parasitemia is a known risk factor for congenital transmission. Benznidazole (BZN) is the drug of choice for preconceptional treatment to reduce parasitic load. The fear of treatment-related side effects limits the implementation of the Argentine guideline recommending BZN 60d/300 mg (or equivalent) treatment of T. cruzi seropositive women during the postpartum period to prevent transmission in a future pregnancy. A short and low dose BZN treatment might reduce major side effects and increase compliance, but its efficacy to reduce T. cruzi parasitic load compared to the standard 60d/300 mg course is not yet established. Clinical trials testing alternative BZN courses among women of reproductive age are urgently needed. Methods and design: We are proposing to perform a double-blinded, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial comparing a short low dose 30-day treatment with BZN 150 mg/day (30d/150 mg) vs. BZN 60d/300 mg. We will recruit not previously treated T. cruzi seropositive women with a live birth during the postpartum period in Argentina, randomize them at 6 months postpartum, and follow them up with the following specific aims: Specific aim 1: to measure the effect of BZN 30d/150 mg compared to 60d/300 mg preconceptional treatment on parasitic load measured by the frequency of positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (primary outcome) and by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), immediately and 10 months after treatment. Specific aim 2: to measure the frequency of serious adverse events and/or any adverse event leading to treatment interruption. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier: NCT03672487.

N2  - Elasmobranchs are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation and population depletion, especially due to their life-history traits, such as low reproductive output and slow growth. Given that capture-induced parturition (abortion or premature birth) is a common consequence of fisheries in elasmobranchs, but still little studied, we investigated how the abortion/premature birth process varies in response to reproductive traits in a freshwater stingray, Potamotrygon amandae. Our results revealed that capture-induced parturition was affected by reproductive traits, such as litter size (one to seven) and gestation stage. The event occurred faster in pregnant females with high litter size during late pregnancy. Also, as found in other elasmobranchs, litter size was positively correlated with maternal size. These findings indicate that larger pregnant females in late pregnancy are more vulnerable to capture-induced parturition. This study improves our understanding of the capture-induced parturition process in stingrays, and provides useful information for management strategies and future recommendations for elasmobranch conservation.

N2  - Objective: To compare the nutritional status of vitamin D, calcium, and serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) between women undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) who became pregnant and women who did not become pregnant during the same postoperative period, as well as the impact of these changes on maternal and child health. Methods: This is a longitudinal and retrospective study of women who previously underwent RYGB, paired by age and preoperative body mass index (BMI), divided into two groups: group 1 (G1), comprising 79 women who did not become pregnant, and group 2 (G2), comprising 40 pregnant women assessed in the overall trimesters. Both groups were analyzed before surgery (T0) and in the same interval after surgery: less than or equal to 1 year (T1) or greater than 1 year (T2), with a 2-year period at the most. Serum concentrations of vitamin D, calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and gestational and neonatal complications were investigated. Statistical analysis was performed by the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 21.0 (p < 0.05). Results: Despite the additional nutritional demands at pregnancy, women evaluated after 1 year of RYGB had the highest demands of vitamin D when compared with pregnant women in the second trimester(p = 0.04). Women who became pregnant within 1 year of bariatric surgery were more likely to develop a urinary tract infection which, in turn, was associated with vitamin D inadequacy (p = 0.02).In the same period, the concentrations of calcium in the second and third trimesters showed a strong correlation with the number of pregnancies (R = 0.8, p = 0.008, R = 0.8, p = 0.003) and deliveries (R = 0.7, p = 0.013, R = 0.8, p = 0.006) and its nutritional status in the first trimester also showed a strong correlation with the occurrence of small newborns for gestational age/large for gestational age (SGA/LGA) (R = 0.8, p = 0.007). Conclusion: Since the highest vitamin D depletions occurred in G1 when compared with G2, the study suggests that a period of time for supplementation and its adjustments in post-bariatric pregnancy may be beneficial. It also encourages further investigation on the number of pregnancies/deliveries during prenatal care, due to vitamin D influence on the nutritional status of calcium, and it points out that changes in concentrations of this vitamin in pregnant women may lead to SGA/LGA newborns’ births.

N2  - Each year, 4.3 million pregnant women are exposed to malaria risk in Latin America and the Caribbean. Plasmodium vivax causes 76% of the regional malaria burden and appears to be less affected than P. falciparum by current elimination efforts. This is in part due to the parasi-te’s ability to stay dormant in the liver and originate relapses within months after a single mos-quito inoculation. Primaquine (PQ) is routinely combined with chloroquine (CQ) or other schizontocidal drugs to supress P. vivax relapses and reduce the risk of late blood-stage recrudescences of parasites with low-grade CQ resistance. However, PQ is contraindicated for pregnant women, who remain at increased risk of repeated infections following CQ-only treatment. Here we apply a mathematical model to time-to-recurrence data from Juruá Val-ley, Brazil0 s main malaria transmission hotspot, to quantify the extra burden of parasite recurrences attributable to PQ ineligibility in pregnant women. The model accounts for competing risks, since relapses and late recrudescences (that may be at least partially prevented by PQ) and new infections (that are not affected by PQ use) all contribute to recurrences. We compare recurrence rates observed after primary P. vivax infections in 158 pregnant women treated with CQ only and 316 P. vivax infections in non-pregnant control women, matched for age, date of infection, and place of residence, who were administered a standard CQ-PQ combination. We estimate that, once infected with P. vivax, 23% of the pregnant women have one or more vivax malaria recurrences over the next 12 weeks; 86% of these early P. vivax recurrences are attributable to relapses or late recrudescences, rather than new infections that could be prevented by reducing malaria exposure during pregnancy. Model simulations indicate that weekly CQ chemoprophylaxis extending over 4 to 12 weeks, starting after the first vivax malaria episode diagnosed in pregnancy, might reduce the risk of P. vivax recurrences over the next 12 months by 20% to 65%. We conclude that post-treatment CQ prophylaxis could be further explored as a measure to prevent vivax malaria recurrences in pregnancy and avert their adverse effects on maternal and neonatal health.

N2  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women and the vertical transmission of the disease. Methods: Observational studies were identified from eight electronic databases, and details on study design, population and prevalence of Chagas disease were extracted. The data were pooled using a random-effects model, and choropleth maps were created based on geopolitical regions and countries. Results: The search identified 7788 articles, of which 50 were eligible. We observed a 9% prevalence of Chagas disease among pregnant women in the Americas (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8–10, I2 = 99.96%). High disease prevalence was identified in pregnant women in South American countries (12%, 95% CI: 11–13), while lower values were identified in pregnant women in North America (2%, 95% CI: 1–3). Countries with medium Human Development Index (HDI) had a higher prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women (15%, 95% CI: 13–16, I2 = 99.98%) than countries with high HDI (3%, 95% CI: 2–3). The rate of vertical transmission in the continent was 2% (95% CI: 1–2). The statistical analysis showed that this heterogeneity was explained by the study design, region of the Americas and mean income of the country. Conclusion: South and Central American countries have a high prevalence and vertical transmission of Chagas disease. Therefore, systematic screens for this disease during the prenatal period are necessary in addition to the diagnosis and treatment of children at risk for Trypanosoma cruzi infection.

N2  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and to identify the risk factors associated with T. gondii infection in pregnant individuals living in the Ponta de Pedras municipality, Marajó Archipelago, State of Pará, where an outbreak of toxoplasmosis occurred in 2013. From 2014 to March 2017, a cross-sectional study was conducted, including 555 pregnant individuals aged 13- to 42-years-old. Serological tests (enzyme immunoassays) were performed, and socioenvironmental and behavioral information were obtained through the application of a questionnaire. A prevalence of 68.3% was detected, and older age, having contact with soil and living in an urban area were the risk factors associated with seropositivity. The study confirmed the high prevalence of infection among pregnant individuals in the region. The association of the infection with the variables of residential area and contact with soil indicates that there was environmental contamination by T. gondii oocysts in the municipality.

N2  - Background: Food insecurity (FI) occurs when people lack secure access to sufficient amounts of safe and nutritious food. FI has been associated with negative effects on human health, including during the prenatal and neonatal periods. The objective of this study is to evaluate the consequences of FI for pregnant women's and newborns' health. Methods: A literature search was performed with three independent researchers based on the PRISMA guidelines; the search covered the period of November 2008 to July 2019 and was conducted in the following databases: the US National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health (PubMed), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS), Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus and OpenGrey. The terms and descriptors were defined by consulting the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS) platforms and mainly included "food security", "food insecurity", "pregnancy" and "newborn". The studies were selected through a title and abstract review and then a reading of the full text. The quality of the studies and the risk of bias were analysed based on the criteria defined in the "Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewers' Manual" and by Guyatt and colleagues for interventional studies. The population, study design, FI measurement instruments, FI proportions, outcomes, confounders and results were extracted from the 37 studies that were selected according to the eligibility and quality criteria. Results: FI ​​proportions ranged from 5.2 to 87%. Most studies were conducted with African populations (42.2%) and applied globally used scales to assess FI (56.7%); 27% of the studies adapted scales. There were wide variations in the instruments used to estimate FI. The main outcomes related to FI included stress, anxiety and depression during pregnancy, followed by dietary quality and dietary diversity. Associations of FI with birth defects, neonatal mortality and the early introduction of animal milk to the infant's diet were also observed. Conclusions: It is necessary to pay attention to the diversity of FI measurement instruments before FI results are compared. FI can be a risk factor for depression and stress during pregnancy, as well as for neonatal mortality, newborn health problems and breastfeeding interruption. Trial registration: This systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42018109478).

N2  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emergent arthropod-borne virus whose outbreak in Brazil has brought major public health problems. Infected individuals have different symptoms, including rash and pruritus, which can be relieved by the administration of antiallergics. In the case of pregnant women, ZIKV can cross the placenta and infect the fetus leading to congenital defects. We have identified that mast cells in the placentae of patients who had Zika during pregnancy can be infected. This led to our investigation on the possible role of mast cells during a ZIKV infection, using the HMC-1 cell line. We analyzed their permissiveness to infection, release of mediators and ultrastructural changes. Flow cytometry detection of ZIKV-NS1 expression 24 h post infection in 45.3% of cells showed that HMC-1 cells are permissive to ZIKV infection. Following infection, β-hexosaminidase was measured in the supernatant of the cells with a notable release at 30 min. In addition, an increase in TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and VEGF levels were measured at 6 h and 24 h post infection. Lastly, different intracellular changes were observed in an ultrastructural analysis of infected cells. Our findings suggest that mast cells may represent an important source of mediators that can activate other immune cell types during a ZIKV infection, which has the potential to be a major contributor in the spread of the virus in cases of vertical transmission.

N2  - Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of mortality among people living with HIV (PLHIV). An invigorated global END TB Strategy seeks to increase efforts in scaling up TB preventive therapy (TPT) as a central intervention for HIV programmes in an effort to contribute to a 90% reduction in TB incidence and 95% reduction in mortality by 2035. TPT in PLHIV should be part of a comprehensive approach to reduce TB transmission, illness and death that also includes TB active case-finding and prompt, effective and timely initiation of anti-TB therapy among PLHIV. However, the use and implementation of preventive strategies has remained deplorably inadequate and today TB prevention among PLHIV has become an urgent priority globally. Discussion: We present a summary of the current and novel TPT regimens, including current evidence of use with antiretroviral regimens (ART). We review challenges and opportunities to scale-up TB prevention within HIV programmes, including the use of differentiated care approaches and demand creation for effective TB/HIV services delivery. TB preventive vaccines and diagnostics, including optimal algorithms, while important topics, are outside of the focus of this commentary. Conclusions: A number of new tools and strategies to make TPT a standard of care in HIV programmes have become available. The new TPT regimens are safe and effective and can be used with current ART, with attention being paid to potential drug-drug interactions between rifamycins and some classes of antiretrovirals. More research and development is needed to optimize TPT for small children, pregnant women and drug-resistant TB (DR-TB). Effective programmatic scale-up can be supported through context-adapted demand creation strategies and the inclusion of TPT in client-centred services, such as differentiated service delivery (DSD) models. Robust collaboration between the HIV and TB programmes represents a unique opportunity to ensure that TB, a preventable and curable condition, is no longer the number one cause of death in PLHIV.

N2  - Recently, in China, in 2019, a new type of disease has arisen caused by a new strain of coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, considered extremely worrying due to its high infectivity power and the easy ability to spread geographically. For patients in general, the clinical features resulting from respiratory syndromes can trigger an asymptomatic condition. However, 25 % of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 can progress to severity. Pregnant women are an unknown field in this complex process, and although they have symptoms similar to non-pregnant women, some points should be considered, such as complications during pregnancy and postpartum. Thus, the aim of this study was to understand the consequences of pregnancy and fetal development, caused by infections by the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Among the aforementioned infections, MERS-CoV seems to be the most dangerous for newborns, inducing high blood pressure, pre-eclampsia, pneumonia, acute renal failure, and multiple organ failure in mother. This also causes a higher occurrence of emergency cesarean deliveries and premature births, in addition, some deaths of mothers and fetuses were recorded. Meanwhile, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 appear to have less severe symptoms. Furthermore, although a study found the ACE2 receptor, used by SARS-CoV-2, widely distributed in specific cell types of the maternal-fetal interface, there is no evidence of vertical transmission for any of the coronaviruses. Thus, the limited reported obstetric cases alert to the need for advanced life support for pregnant women infected with coronaviruses and to the need for further investigation for application in clinical practice.

N2  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is associated with a spectrum of developmental impairments known as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). The prevalence of this syndrome varies across ZIKV endemic regions, suggesting that its occurrence could depend on cofactors. Here, we evaluate the relevance of protein malnutrition for the emergence of CZS. Epidemiological data from the ZIKV outbreak in the Americas suggest a relationship between undernutrition and cases of microcephaly. To experimentally examine this relationship, we use immunocompetent pregnant mice, which were subjected to protein malnutrition and infected with a Brazilian ZIKV strain. We found that the combination of protein restriction and ZIKV infection leads to severe alterations of placental structure and embryonic body growth, with offspring displaying a reduction in neurogenesis and postnatal brain size. RNA-seq analysis reveals gene expression deregulation required for brain development in infected low-protein progeny. These results suggest that maternal protein malnutrition increases susceptibility to CZS.

N2  - The outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Brazil and in many countries was marked by the occurrences of fetal malformations and neurological effects upon infection of pregnant women. Like other members of the Flaviviridae family, ZIKV in semen is infectious and sexually transmitted. Viral persistence in the male genital tract is unresolved and still needs further understanding. A regular semen donor was followed from the acute phase of ZIKV infection, up to 8 months after ZIKV in his body fluids became undetected. Immunofluorescence assay was performed in semen samples before and after the infection. A significant decrease in sperm concentration and in the percentage of progressive motility of sperm was observed. The methodology adopted for clearance of sexually transmitted viruses decreased virus load, but the complete clearance of ZIKV from semen was not achieved.

N2  - OBJECTIVE To analyze the many factors regarding socioeconomic and healthcare-related variables linked to maternal diseases and the possible impact of the environmental disaster of Mariana, given the prenatal exposure to different water sources for human consumption that were associated with low birthweight in full-term live births in the Municipal Hospital of Governador Valadares, Minas Gerais. METHODS Case-control study, carried out with live births at the Municipal Hospital of Governador Valadares, from May 2017 to July 2018. The case group consisted of full-term live births and low birthweight, and the control group consisted of full-term live births with adequate weight, matched by gender and date of birth. For each case, two controls were selected. Data collection was performed through interviews with the puerperal women, and complementary information was obtained by analyzing the prenatal card and medical records. For data analysis, logistic regression was performed. RESULTS The study included 65 live births from the case group and 130 from the control group. After the analysis was adjusted for other factors under study, we found that the higher risks of low birthweight are associated with the first childbirth (OR = 2.033; 95%CI = 1.047-3.948; p = 0.036), smoking during pregnancy (OR = 2.850; 95%CI = 1.013-8.021; p = 0.047) and consumption of water supplied by the municipalities affected by the tailings from the Fundão dam failure (RC = 2.444; 95%CI = 1.203-4.965; p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS The variables "water consumed during pregnancy," "previous pregnancies" and "maternal smoking" were associated with low birthweight in the population studied. The importance of epidemiological studies that assess water quality and its adverse health effects is reinforced, as well as greater prenatal control of first-time pregnant women and greater support of policies against smoking, especially during pregnancy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize violence against women during pregnancy and to verify its association with socioeconomic, demographic, obstetric, behavioral factors, health care and diseases during pregnancy. METHODS: Cross-sectional study carried out with puerperal women whose birth took place at the Municipal Hospital of Governador Valadares, in Minas Gerais, from May 2017 to July 2018. Data collection was performed through interviews, and complementary information was obtained by analyzing the prenatal file and medical records. For data analysis, logistic regression was used. RESULTS: The total of 771 puerperal women participated in the study. Of these, 62 (8.0%) reported having suffered physical, psychological or sexual violence during pregnancy. The pregnant women most likely to have suffered violence were alcohol dependent (OR = 4.97; 95%CI 2.30-10.75; p < 0.001), those who did not perform prenatal care (OR = 3.88; 95%CI 1.00-15.09; p = 0.050), those who used health services in an emergency during pregnancy (OR = 2.47; 95%CI 1.42-4.30; p = 0.001) and who had gestational diabetes (OR = 2.59; 95%CI 1.06-6.32; p = 0.037) and sexually transmitted diseases (OR = 3.85; 95%CI 1.41-10.50; p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Violence against pregnant women is associated with behavioral factors and related to health care and diseases during pregnancy. It is essential to recognize factors associated by health professionals through actions to track situations of violence against women since the beginning of prenatal care, in order to enable early intervention.

N2  - Background: The European Commission (EC) Horizon 2020 (H2020)-funded ZIKAlliance Consortium designed a multicentre study including pregnant women (PW), children (CH) and natural history (NH) cohorts. Clinical sites were selected over a wide geographic range within Latin America and the Caribbean, taking into account the dynamic course of the ZIKV epidemic. Methods: Recruitment to the PW cohort will take place in antenatal care clinics. PW will be enrolled regardless of symptoms and followed over the course of pregnancy, approximately every 4 weeks. PW will be revisited at delivery (or after miscarriage/abortion) to assess birth outcomes, including microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities according to the evolving definition of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). After birth, children will be followed for 2 years in the CH cohort. Follow-up visits are scheduled at ages 1-3, 4-6, 12, and 24 months to assess neurocognitive and developmental milestones. In addition, a NH cohort for the characterization of symptomatic rash/fever illness was designed, including follow-up to capture persisting health problems. Blood, urine, and other biological materials will be collected, and tested for ZIKV and other relevant arboviral diseases (dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever) using RT-PCR or serological methods. A virtual, decentralized biobank will be created. Reciprocal clinical monitoring has been established between partner sites. Substudies of ZIKV seroprevalence, transmission clustering, disabilities and health economics, viral kinetics, the potential role of antibody enhancement, and co-infections will be linked to the cohort studies. Discussion: Results of these large cohort studies will provide better risk estimates for birth defects and other developmental abnormalities associated with ZIKV infection including possible co-factors for the variability of risk estimates between other countries and regions. Additional outcomes include incidence and transmission estimates of ZIKV during and after pregnancy, characterization of short and long-term clinical course following infection and viral kinetics of ZIKV. Study registrations: clinicaltrials.gov NCT03188731 (PW cohort), June 15, 2017; clinicaltrials.gov NCT03393286 (CH cohort), January 8, 2018; clinicaltrials.gov NCT03204409 (NH cohort), July 2, 2017.

N2  - Exposure of pregnant women to pesticides in an occupational or incidental manner has been pointed out as a possible cause of health problems in newborns. Cypermethrin and methomyl are insecticides whose active compounds and metabolites can cause harm to the health of pregnant women and their offspring. Both contribute to increases in the concentrations of oxidizing agents that damage DNA, causing mutations. Thus, the use of antioxidant substances, such as melatonin, could serve as protection against genetic damage, reducing the problems caused by insecticides. Here, we evaluated the protective effect of exogenous melatonin in adult rats and their offspring exposed to methomyl and cypermethrin during the gestational period. Thirty adult rats were divided into five groups from the first day of pregnancy: NC - negative control, Mth received 0.02 mg/kg/day of methomyl, Cyp received 0.05 mg/kg/day cypermethrin, MthMl received 0.02 mg/kg/day methomyl combined with 10 mg/kg/day melatonin, and CypMl received 0.05 mg/kg/day cypermethrin combined with 10 mg/kg/day melatonin. Blood and liver samples were collected from the dams; blood, liver, and brain samples were collected from the offspring. All tissues were used for comet assay; blood was used for micronucleus test. Our results demonstrate that cypermethrin and methomyl induce significant genetic damage in the tissues of dams and offspring. Treatment with melatonin significantly reduced cypermethrin-induced genetic damage in dams and pups; however, melatonin was not effective against the genetic damage caused by methomyl. Thus, melatonin may be considered a promising agent for the reduction of genotoxic effects induced by cypermethrin but appears to be inefficient against the genotoxic effects caused by methomyl, probably due to differences in the metabolism of each pesticide.

N2  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy causes congenital abnormalities, including microcephaly. However, rates vary widely, and the contributing risk factors remain unclear. We examined the serum antibody response to ZIKV and other flaviviruses in Brazilian women giving birth during the 2015–2016 outbreak. Infected pregnancies with intermediate or higher ZIKV antibody enhancement titers were at increased risk to give birth to microcephalic infants compared with those with lower titers (P < 0.0001). Similarly, analysis of ZIKV-infected pregnant macaques revealed that fetal brain damage was more frequent in mothers with higher enhancement titers. Thus, features of the maternal antibodies are associated with and may contribute to the genesis of ZIKV-associated microcephaly.

N2  - Background: To assess the influence of the time interval between pregnancy and the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) on maternal-infant complications. Methods: This is an analytical, longitudinal and retrospective study comprising 42 pregnant women who had previously undergone RYGB, subdivided according to the time interval between pregnancy and bariatric surgery: ≤12 months (G1), >12 and <24 months (G2) and ≥24 months (G3). Anthropometric variables of mothers, newborns and information on pregnancy complications were collected. Results: G1 was the group more likely to develop urinary tract infection, dumping syndrome and inadequacy of birth weight than G2. Pregnancy complications were similar and >80.0% both in the first 12 months and after 24 months of the RYGB and the smallest percentages occurred in the time interval of 12-24 months after it. In addition, the percentage of neonatal complications was the highest in G1 when compared to the other times studied. Conclusion: Our findings indicate less predisposition to maternal-infant complications in pregnancies occurring in the time interval of >12 and <24 months and suggest that pregnancy after 24 months can be as harmful as pregnancies occurring before the first 12 postoperative months, since a great catabolism occurs at this time as it has been shown in the literature.

N2  - Introduction: The state of Sergipe showed the second highest prevalence (227.2 cases per 100,000 live births) of microcephaly associated with Zika virus (ZIKV) in the 2015 epidemic year in Brazil, although no cases of ZIKV infection were reported in Sergipe that year. This situation reveals problems in differential diagnosis and reporting of arboviruses faced by the State. Aim: To investigate ZIKV infection inmosquitoes from cities located along one of the highways linking Sergipe to the State of Bahia. Methods: Mosquitoes were collected using battery-powered aspirator in neighborhoods of high mosquito infestation in the counties of Sao Cristovao, Laranjeiras, Itabaiana e Simao Dias. After collection, they were transferred to cups and brought alive to the laboratory, where they were frozen and quickly screened for species and sex. Females were sectioned at the waist and the heads and thorax were inserted into microtubes and macerated. Viral RNA was extracted using PureLinkR Viral RNA / DNA Mini Kit and then a reaction was performed for the complementary DNA (cDNA) using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The diagnosis for arboviruses was performed by PCR with Flavivirus-specific primers. Positive samples were submitted to PCR with the use of primers specific for ZIKV. Results: From February to October 2018, 423 households were sampled, and 3,451 mosquitoes were collected, of which 184 were Ae. aegypti females. The highest density of females (female / house) was detected in Itabaiana (0.68), followed by Simao Dias (0.43), Laranjeiras (0.35) and Sao Cristovao (0,24). Flavivirus infection was detected in 35 females, of which 10 were positive for ZIKV, all them from Itabaiana, showing an infection rate of 5.4% (10/75) for that city. Conclusion: Our results showed that although three of the counties were negative, ZIKV is circulating in the state and may be causing asymptomatic or mild infections. In 2018 only 8 cases of Zika were reported across the state, which is inconsistent with the mosquito infection rate we found and alert to the need for surveillance of neurological diseases, care for the pregnant woman and intensification of vector control and infrastructure improvement.

N2  - Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) is characterized by placental accumulation of Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preterm delivery (PTD). Placental ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters mediate the efflux of nutrients, cytokines and xenobiotics. The expression and activity of these transporters are highly responsive to infection. We hypothesized that MiP would perturb the expression of placental ABC transporters, promoting PTD. Peripheral blood, spleens, livers and placentas of pregnant mice, infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA on gestational day (GD) 13.5, were collected and analyzed on GD18.5. The primary consequences of human MiP, including IUGR, PTD (20%) and placental inflammation, were recapitulated in our mouse model. Electron microscopy revealed attenuated presence of labyrinthine microvilli and dilated spongiotrophoblasts -granular endoplasmic reticulum cisternae. Additionally, a decrease in placental Abca1 (ABCA1), Abcb1b (P-glycoprotein), Abcb9 and Abcg2 (BCRP) expression was observed in MiP mice. In conclusion, MiP associated with PTD impairs placental ABC transporters' expression, potentially modulating placental nutrient, environmental toxin and xenobiotic biodistribution within the fetal compartment, and may, at some degree, be involved with pregnancy outcome in MiP.

N2  - Objectives: The visceral yolk sac is an important fetal membrane that accomplishes vital maternal-fetal transport functions. We hypothesized that placental malaria modifies the expression of key yolk sac ABC transporters. Our objective was to investigate the impact of pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) on the morphometry and expression of key ABC transporters in the murine visceral yolk sac. Methods: Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (i.p.) on gestational day (GD) 13.5. On GD18.5, yolk sac membranes were harvested for morphometric analysis and gene expression assessment of selected ABC transporters and pro-inflammatory cytokines, using qPCR. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Abca1 expression and localization. Statistical analysis was undertaken using the student T-test. Results: P. berghei ANKA infection did not alter the volumetric proportion of the yolk sac’s histological components. However, it increased yolk sac Abcb1a mRNA expression while decreasing Abcg1 mRNA (P<0.05). No differences in the mRNA levels for the Abca1, Abcb1b, Abcg2 transporters were observed. There were also no differences in the expression of the chemokine Ccl2. Yolk sac P-gp and Abca1 protein were highly localized in the endodermic epithelium but were also detected in the mesothelium and in the endothelium of mesodermic blood vessels. The intensity of yolk sac P-gp immunolabeling was stronger in both endodermic epithelium and mesothelium, whereas Abca1 labeling increased in the endothelium of the mesodermic blood vessels (P<0.05). Conclusion: The mouse yolk sac is responsive to infectious agents. Altered expression of P-gp and Abca1 has the potential to change biodisposition of drugs, environmental toxins and nutrients in the fetal compartment and may be involved in the pathogenesis of IUGR and PTL that is observed in cases of human PAM.

N2  - Background: In May 2018, a potential risk of neural tube defects (NTD) in infants born to HIV-positive women exposed to dolutegravir (DTG) at pregnancy conception was announced. With widespread availability of DTG since 2016, Brazilian public health leaders initiated a national evaluation of birth outcomes of women exposed to DTG at conception. Methods: Women who became pregnant while on ART containing DTG, efavirenz (EFV), or raltegravir (RAL) within ± 8 weeks from estimated date of conception (EDC) between January 2015 and May 2018 were identified using the Brazilian ART database. Every woman with DTG exposure and three women receiving EFV-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) from similar locations were investigated. Trained personnel systematically collected demographic, medical, obstetric, radiographic, laboratory, and birth outcome data. The primary outcome was the occurrence of NTD; 95% Wilson confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Characteristics at EDC and during antenatal care were evaluated. Results: Overall, 1468 women were included, of which 382 were DTG-exposed and 1086 EFV-and/or RAL-exposed. At conception, DTG-exposed women were slightly younger, more recently diagnosed with HIV, had lower CD4 cell counts, and were less likely to have virological suppression. During pregnancy, 48 and 45% of DTGexposed and-unexposed women, respectively, received folic acid supplementation. Prenatal syphilis occurred in 11% of DTG-exposed women (vs. 6% in unexposed, p < 0.01) and gestational hypertension occurred in 7% (vs. 3%, p < 0.01). There were a total of 1493 birth outcomes (Table 1). There were no NTD in either exposure group (0 [95%CI 0, 0.0099] in DTG-exposed and 0 [95%CI 0, 0.003] in DTGunexposed). Twenty-five (6.5%) and 48 (4.3%) stillbirths/abortions occurred among DTG-exposed and-unexposed fetuses, respectively (p = 0.09). Conclusions: DTG-exposure was not associated with NTD in our cohort; the incidence of NTD is likely well under 1% among DTGexposed HIV-positive women in Brazil. Ongoing pharmacovigilance of pregnancy outcomes from diverse settings is necessary for clarification of NTD risk associated with DTG.

N2  - Introduction Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is a known cause of microcephaly and other congenital and developmental anomalies. In the absence of a ZIKV vaccine or prophylactics, principal investigators (PIs) and international leaders in ZIKV research have formed the ZIKV Individual Participant Data (IPD) Consortium to identify, collect and synthesise IPD from longitudinal studies of pregnant women that measure ZIKV infection during pregnancy and fetal, infant or child outcomes. Methods and analysis We will identify eligible studies through the ZIKV IPD Consortium membership and a systematic review and invite study PIs to participate in the IPD meta-analysis (IPD-MA). We will use the combined dataset to estimate the relative and absolute risk of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), including microcephaly and late symptomatic congenital infections; identify and explore sources of heterogeneity in those estimates and develop and validate a risk prediction model to identify the pregnancies at the highest risk of CZS or adverse developmental outcomes. The variable accuracy of diagnostic assays and differences in exposure and outcome definitions means that included studies will have a higher level of systematic variability, a component of measurement error, than an IPD-MA of studies of an established pathogen. We will use expert testimony, existing internal and external diagnostic accuracy validation studies and laboratory external quality assessments to inform the distribution of measurement error in our models. We will apply both Bayesian and frequentist methods to directly account for these and other sources of uncertainty. Ethics and dissemination The IPD-MA was deemed exempt from ethical review. We will convene a group of patient advocates to evaluate the ethical implications and utility of the risk stratification tool. Findings from these analyses will be shared via national and international conferences and through publication in open access, peer-reviewed journals.

N2  - The study aimed to assess conformity with Brazil's standard protocol for diagnostic and therapeutic practices in the management of congenital syphilis by pediatricians in public maternity hospitals. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2015 with 41 pediatricians working in all the public maternity hospitals in Teresina, the capital of Piauí State, Northeast Brazil, through self-completed questionnaires. The study assessed the conformity of knowledge and practices according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health protocols. The study has made evident low access to training courses (54%) and insufficient knowledge of the case definition of congenital syphilis (42%) and rapid tests for syphilis (39%). Flaws were observed in the diagnostic workup and treatment of newborns. Requesting VDRL (88%) and correct treatment of neurosyphilis (88%) were the practices that showed the highest conformity with standard protocols. Low conformity with protocols leads to missed opportunities for identifying and adequately treating congenital syphilis. Based on the barriers identified in the study, better access to diagnostic and treatment protocols, improved recording on prenatal cards and hospital patient charts, availability of tests and medicines, and educational work with pregnant women should be urgently implemented, aiming to reverse the currently inadequate management of congenital syphilis and to curb its spread.

N2  - Purpose: Studies with foods, known to promote health benefits in addition to the nutritive value, show that their consumption by pregnant and/or lactating females could induce negative outcomes to the offspring. It is well characterized that cinnamon intake promotes benefits to energy homeostasis. The present study aimed to analyze the effects of the consumption of an aqueous extract of cinnamon by lactating female rats on the endocrine-metabolic outcomes in the adult offspring. Methods: Lactating dams (Wistar rats) were supplemented with cinnamon aqueous extract (400 mg/kg body weight/day) for the entire lactating period. The male adult offspring were evaluated at 180 days old (CinLac). Results: The offspring presented visceral obesity (P = 0.001), hyperleptinemia (P = 0.002), and hyperinsulinemia (P = 0.016). In the liver, CinLac exhibited reduced p-IRβ (P = 0.018) suggesting insulin resistance. However, phosphorylation of IRS1 (P = 0.041) and AKT (P = 0.050) were increased. JAK2 (P = 0.030) and p-STAT3 (P = 0.015) expressions were higher, suggesting that the activation of IRS1/AKT in the CinLac group could have resulted from the increased activation of leptin signaling. Although we observed no changes in the gluconeogenic pathway, the CinLac group exhibited lower hepatic glycogen content (P = 0.005) accompanied by increased p-GSK3β (P = 0.011). In addition, the CinLac group showed increased hepatic triacylglycerol content (P = 0.049) and a mild steatosis (P = 0.001), accompanied by reduced PPARα mRNA expression (P = 0.005). Conclusion: We conclude that maternal intake of aqueous extract of cinnamon induces long-term molecular, metabolic, and hormonal changes in the adult progeny, including visceral obesity, higher lipid accumulation, and lower glycogen content in the liver.

N2  - Background: Chronic Chagas Disease (CD) diagnosis is based on serological methods employing crude, semipurified or recombinant antigens, which may result in low sensitivity or cross-reactivity. To reduce these restrictions, we developed a strategy involving use of molecules containing repetitive fragments of Trypanosoma cruzi conserved proteins. Diagnostic performance of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens (Molecular Biology Institute of Paraná - IBMP in Portuguese acronym) was assessed to diagnose T. cruzi-infected and non-infected immigrants living in Barcelona (Spain), a non-endemic setting for Chagas disease. Methods: Reactivity of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 was assessed using an in-house automated ELISA with 347 positive and 331 negative individuals to Chagas disease. Antigenic cross-reactivity was measured with sera samples from pregnant women with Toxoplasma gondii (n = 98) and Zika virus (n = 75) antibodies. Results: The area under the curve values was 1 and 0.99 for the IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 proteins, respectively, demonstrating excellent diagnostic accuracy. The reactivity index was higher for IBMP-8.1 than IBMP-8.4 in positive samples and no significant difference in reactivity index was observed in negative samples. Sensitivity ranged from 99.4% for IBMP-8.1 to 99.1% for IBMP-8.4 and was not statistically different. Specificity for IBMP-8.1 reached 100 and 99.7% for IBMP-8.4, both nearly 100% accurate. No antigenic cross-reactivity was observed and reactivity index was similar to that for negative Chagas disease individuals. Conclusions: Our results showed an outstanding performance of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens by ELISA and suggest both chimeric antigens could also be used for Chagas disease diagnosis in immigrants living in non-endemic settings.

N2  - Purpose: Chagas Disease (CD) occurs principally in the continental part of Latin America; however it has been increasingly detected in European countries. The disease is prevalent in Latin American migrants living in Europe although the classical route of transmission does not occur. The other less common transmission routes that have been demonstrated in Europe are blood transfusion, transplantation and vertically from mother-to-child. A retrospective observational study was conducted from 2011 to 2017 at Microbiology Department in our Hospital. The aim of the study is to assess the seroprevalence of CD in a non-endemic area (Latin American population attended in this area) in order to estimate risk groups and to promote an effective screening. Methods & Materials: Serological screening was performed through two different methods (WHO recommendations): chemiluminiscent microparticle immunoassay (Architect-Abbott®) and then in positives, inmunofluoresce assay (VIRCELL®). Samples with discrepant results were evaluated by molecular methods in newborns and pregnant women. Results: A total of 3420 serum samples corresponding to 2760 patients were screened for CD. Out of these patients, 5,4% (150) were positive. Among positive cases the majority were females (76%), diagnosed during a prenatal serological screening, representing the half of the positive results. Diagnosis request was made from Primary Care Centers (including some prenatal screenings) in 39% of cases. The distribution by age rates was the following: adults under 35 were 59 (39,3%), adults above 35 were 79 (52,6%), the 8% (12) were children: 8 out of them were diagnosed at birth, but only 2 were confirmed with PCR. Country of origin distribution was the following: Bolivia (90,6%), Ecuador (6%), Paraguay (2%) and Brazil (1,3%). Conclusion: - Around us there is an awareness of a necessity of an early diagnosis of this disease especially in Latin-American pregnant women and their children in primary care as in specialist healthcare. - Most of Chagas disease patients were from Bolivia, however the screening must be performed to all Latin Americans migrants despite of a low prevalence. - The protocol applied in our center meets the WHO criteria.

N2  - Purpose: To analyze risk factors for recurrent toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis. Design: Single center prospective case series. Population and Methods: A total of 230 patients with toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis were prospectively followed to assess recurrences. All patients were treated with a specific drug regime for toxoplasmosis in each episode of active retinochoroiditis. Individuals with chronic diseases and pregnant women were excluded. Survival analysis by extended Cox regression model (Prentice-Williams-Peterson counting process model) was performed to evaluate the time between recurrences according to some potential risk factors: age, number of retinochoroidal lesions at initial evaluation, sex and interferon gamma +874 T/A gene polymorphism. Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were provided to interpret the risk effects. Results: One hundred sixty-two recurrence episodes were observed in 104 (45.2%) patients during follow-up that lasted from 269 to 1976 days. Mean age at presentation was 32.8 years (Standard deviation = 11.38). The risk of recurrence during follow up was influenced by age (HR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01-1.04) and number of retinochoroidal lesions at the beginning of the study (HR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.07-2.40). Heterozygosis for IFN-γ gene polymorphism at position +874 T/A was also associated with recurrence (HR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.04-2.14). Conclusion: The risk of ocular toxoplasmosis recurrence after an active episode increased with age and was significantly higher in individuals with primary lesions, which suggests that individuals with this characteristic and the elderly could benefit from recurrence prophylactic strategies with antimicrobials. Results suggest an association between IFN-γ gene polymorphism at position +874T/A and recurrence.

N2  - Importance: Congenital Zika virus infection causes a spectrum of adverse birth outcomes, including severe birth defects of the central nervous system. The association of prenatal ultrasonographic findings with adverse neonatal outcomes, beyond structural anomalies such as microcephaly, has not been described to date. Objective: To determine whether prenatal ultrasonographic examination results are associated with abnormal neonatal outcomes in Zika virus-affected pregnancies. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort study conducted at a single regional referral center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from September 1, 2015, to May 31, 2016, among 92 pregnant women diagnosed during pregnancy with Zika virus infection by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, who underwent subsequent prenatal ultrasonographic and neonatal evaluation. Exposures: Prenatal ultrasonography. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was composite adverse neonatal outcome (perinatal death, abnormal finding on neonatal examination, or abnormal finding on postnatal neuroimaging). Secondary outcomes include association of specific findings with neonatal outcomes. Results: Of 92 mother-neonate dyads (mean [SD] maternal age, 29.4 [6.3] years), 55 (60%) had normal results and 37 (40%) had abnormal results on prenatal ultrasonographic examinations. The median gestational age at delivery was 38.6 weeks (interquartile range, 37.9-39.3). Of the 45 neonates with composite adverse outcome, 23 (51%) had normal results on prenatal ultrasonography. Eleven pregnant women (12%) had a Zika virus-associated finding that was associated with an abnormal result on neonatal examination (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 11.6; 95% CI, 1.8-72.8), abnormal result on postnatal neuroimaging (aOR, 6.7; 95% CI, 1.1-38.9), and composite adverse neonatal outcome (aOR, 27.2; 95% CI, 2.5-296.6). Abnormal results on middle cerebral artery Doppler ultrasonography were associated with neonatal examination abnormalities (aOR, 12.8; 95% CI, 2.6-63.2), postnatal neuroimaging abnormalities (aOR, 8.8; 95% CI, 1.7-45.9), and composite adverse neonatal outcome (aOR, 20.5; 95% CI, 3.2-132.6). There were 2 perinatal deaths. Abnormal findings on prenatal ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 48.9% (95% CI, 33.7%-64.2%) and a specificity of 68.1% (95% CI, 52.9%-80.1%) for association with composite adverse neonatal outcomes. For a Zika virus-associated abnormal result on prenatal ultrasonography, the sensitivity was lower (22.2%; 95% CI, 11.2%-37.1%) but the specificity was higher (97.9%; 95% CI, 88.7%-99.9%). Conclusions and Relevance: Abnormal results on prenatal ultrasonography were associated with adverse outcomes in congenital Zika infection. The absence of abnormal findings on prenatal ultrasonography was not associated with a normal neonatal outcome. Comprehensive evaluation is recommended for all neonates with prenatal Zika virus exposure.

N2  - BACKGROUND. An intricate fetal-maternal immune crosstalk during pregnancy is essential for a healthy birth. Hence, the infection-induced alterations of maternal immunity often lead to adverse outcomes for mother and/or child. The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women has been associated with more than 3,000 cases of microcephaly and nervous system malformations. METHODS. To explore the potential correlation of ZIKV-induced alteration of maternal immunity with fetal abnormalities, we performed extensive sera immunoprofiling of 74 pregnant women: 30 symptomatic ZIKV+ pregnant patients and 30 healthy pregnant controls in ZIKV-endemic Rio de Janeiro, along with 14 healthy pregnant controls in non-endemic Los Angeles. RESULTS. Extensive multiplexing analysis of 69 cytokines revealed that CXCL10, CCL2, and CCL8 chemokines were specifically associated with symptomatic ZIKV+ infection during pregnancy, and distinct immunoprofiles were detected at different trimesters in ZIKV-infected pregnant women. Intriguingly, the high CCL2 level and its inverse correlation with CD163, TNFRSF1A, and CCL22 levels was apparently associated with ZIKV-induced abnormal birth. CONCLUSION. Our findings provide insights into the alteration of ZIKV-elicited maternal immunity, serving as a potential clinical biomarker platform. FUNDING.

N2  - Background: Brazil has at least 800,000 HTLV-1 infected individuals. HTLV-1 can be transmitted via sexual intercourse, contact with blood and from mother to child, mainly by breastfeeding. Treatments for the high morbidity/mortality associated diseases (ATL and HAM/TSP) are limited, therefore, infection prevention is of utmost importance. However, antenatal screening is not routinely performed in Brazil. A lack of data regarding the number of individuals infected via breastfeeding impairs the development of government policies. The objective is to estimate the number of HTLV-1 infections occurring annually due to mother to child transmission (MTCT) in Brazil, nationally and regionally. Methodology: To estimate HTLV-1 MTCT in Brazil the following variables are modelled: number of births, prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in pregnant women, breastfeeding duration rate and transmission risk according to breastfeeding period. The number of cases of HAM/TSP and ATL attributable to MTCT are also estimated. Principal findings: In 2008, there were 2,934,828 live births in Brazil. HTLV prevalence in pregnant women in Brazil ranges between 0.1–1.05% by region. An estimated 16,548 HTLV-1 infected women are pregnant each year. According to the breastfeeding pattern and HTLV-1 prevalence of each region there are an estimated 3,024 new cases of HTLV-1 infection due to MTCT annually of which 2,610 are preventable through infant feeding advice. These 3,024 transmissions will result in 120–604 cases of ATL and 8–272 of HAM/TSP. North-East region comprises the high number of MTCT cases, followed by South-East. Conclusions/significance: A high number of new HTLV-1 infections due to MTCT occur every year in Brazil. Antenatal screening and avoiding breastfeeding are essential to prevent subsequent development of HTLV-1-associated diseases.

N2  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of the mother during pregnancy causes devastating Zika congenital syndrome in the offspring. A ZIKV vaccine with optimal safety and immunogenicity for use in pregnant women is critically needed. Toward this goal, we have developed a single-dose live-attenuated vaccine candidate that infects cells with controlled, limited infection rounds. The vaccine contains a 9-amino-acid deletion in the viral capsid protein and replicates to titers of > 106 focus-forming units (FFU)/mL in cells expressing the full-length capsid protein. Immunization of A129 mice with one dose (105 FFU) did not produce viremia, but elicited protective immunity that completely prevented viremia, morbidity, and mortality after challenge with an epidemic ZIKV strain (106 PFU). A single-dose vaccination also fully prevented infection of pregnant mice and maternal-to-fetal transmission. Intracranial injection of the vaccine (104 FFU) to 1-day-old mice did not cause any disease or death, underscoring the safety of this vaccine candidate. A ZIKV vaccine for use in pregnant women requires an optimal balance between safety and immunogenicity. Xie et al. developed a live-attenuated vaccine candidate that can infect cells with controlled, limited infection rounds. A single-dose immunization of the vaccine prevents vertical transmission of ZIKV in pregnant mice.

N2  - Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient in the diet of mammals and has an important role in the immune function. Selenium is a key element in selenoproteins involved in the in the maintenance of the antioxidant defense. Diet with selenium is beneficial for the treatment of diseases correlated with high levels of oxidative stress, also observed in the Chagas disease. Chagas disease is a neglected disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and several research groups are focused on the illness treatment. Immunomodulation of the infection using microelements is an important tool to avoid deleterious effects of the Chagas disease. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the effects of selenium supplementation on pregnant Wistar rats infected with T. cruzi. Selenium treatment stimulated the weight and length of fetuses and placentas allied to the decrease of blood parasitemia. However, selenium demonstrated a low influence on T cells, diminishing the B cell population (CD45RA+). Moreover, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was downregulated under selenium administration. Low pro-inflammatory cytokines levels probably are related to the increase in the number of amastigote nests in infected and treated animals. Thus, selenium supplementation during pregnancy could impair the local placental immune response. Further studies are necessary to assess the interaction between selenium and the acute Chagas’ disease during pregnancy, which will base future supplementation strategies.

N2  - Objective: To assess the influence of pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), total gestational weight gain (TGWG), and pre-pregnancy surgical success on the nutritional status of vitamin D, calcium, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the trimesters of pregnancy of women who previously underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Methodology: This is an analytical, longitudinal, and retrospective study comprising 42 pregnant women who previously underwent RYGB. Concentrations of vitamin D3, calcium, and PTH were assessed in all trimesters. Anthropometric variables necessary for calculating TGWG, surgical success, and BMI were collected preoperatively and over the trimesters of pregnancy. Results: A total of 97.1% had vitamin D3 inadequacy at some point in pregnancy. Pre-pregnancy BMI, even when classified as overweight, may have exacerbated the serum concentrations of this vitamin in the third trimester (p = 0.011), and it was significantly lower in women with normal weight and/or obesity (p = 0.039). It was evidenced that both pre-pregnancy BMI and TGWG above the recommended optimal weight can be associated with calcium homeostasis, especially early in pregnancy. It was also shown that surgical success in the pre-pregnancy period may have influenced the serum concentrations of vitamin D in the second trimester of pregnancy (p = 0.013). Conclusion: This study draws attention to the importance of monitoring the nutritional status of vitamin D3 and calcium in the prenatal period due to its relationship with pre-pregnancy BMI, TGWG, and surgical success.

N2  - Objectives: To estimate the rates of vertically transmitted infection (VTI) for 2016 in Mato Grosso do Sul State, among pregnant women screened by the Institute for Research, Teaching, and Diagnosis of the Association of Parents and Friends of Children with Special Needs (IPED-APAE), and to identify the counties where the risk for VTI is highest. Method: This descriptive, retrospective, cross-sectional study comprised samples collected from all pregnant women who started prenatal care and were screened with the IPED-APAE test kit to detect HIV I and II, hepatites B and C, rubella, cytomegalovirus, HTLV I and II, toxoplasmosis, Chagas disease, and syphilis infection, using dried filter paper blood samples, followed by validation in venous blood. Rates of positivity (%) and detection (per 1000 live births) were estimated for each type of infection. Results: Of the 39,579 pregnant women screened in 2016, 6.60% (2612) tested positive for at least one of the infections investigated. The rates of positivity (%) and detection (per 1000 live births) were as follows (in descending order): syphilis (3.77 and 33.84, respectively), toxoplasmosis (1.20 and 10.78), hepatitis B (0.67 and 6.06), HIV I and II (0.26 and 2.29), cytomegalovirus (0.24 and 2.1), rubella (0.23 and 2.11), Chagas disease (0.10 and 0.89), HTLV I and II (0.08 and 0.70), and hepatitis C (0.05 and 0.45). Conclusions: Successful investigation of ITV is dependent on effective control measures during pregnancy and childbirth, as well as postnatally. Identifying high-risk counties makes it possible to map the local epidemiological situation and improve public health management at state level to optimize infection control among pregnant women, despite difficulties meeting these demands through municipal services.

N2  - Objectives: The target of this study is to identify differences in nitric oxide (NO) serum levels between postpartum women with and without preeclampsia (PE) and non pregnant women. Method: Study developed in Hospitals Guilherme Álvaro/Santos and Antonio Pedro/Niterói (Brazil). It was collected blood samples in the mediate postpartum, measured serum value of NO. Study group: women with PE (NHBPEP, 2000). Control group: vaginal delivery at term, without comorbidities. Group of non-pregnant women: healthy. Exclusion: infectious, collagen/genetic diseases, smoking, twinning, fetal abnormalities. Variables in the PE group: maternal and gestational age, body mass index, weight adequacy of newborn, association: diabetes and hypertension. Statistical analysis was performed (significance: p<0.05). Results: Nitric oxide serum levels in PE group (51) the value:28.04μM, control group (58): 27.81μM and non pregnant women (32): 17.23μM (p=0.0017). There wasn't statistical significance of maternal and gestational age, body mass index, weight adequacy of newborn and association with diabetes and hypertension with serum levels among women with PE. In the PE group, we identified a higher serum of NO in the cases that the newborns weight was suitable for gestational age. Conclusions: We could identify an important statistical difference between the postpartum women compared to the non-pregnant women, but not among themselves. There was no important difference in maternal variables such as body mass index, maternal and gestational age and association with comorbidities, like DM and hypertension. The higher serum of NO in the cases that the newborns weight was suitable for gestational age, suggesting that this would not be an indicator of lesser impairment in placental function, a hypothesis that probably can not be compared in the dimension of our study.

N2  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in humans has been associated with congenital malformations and other neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. The mechanism(s) of ZIKV intrauterine transmission, the cell types involved, the most vulnerable period of pregnancy for severe outcomes from infection and other physiopathological aspects are not completely elucidated. In this study, we analyzed placental samples obtained at the time of delivery from a group of 24 women diagnosed with ZIKV infection during the first, second or third trimesters of pregnancy. Villous immaturity was the main histological finding in the placental tissues, although placentas without alterations were also frequently observed. Significant enhancement of the number of syncytial sprouts was observed in the placentas of women infected during the third trimester, indicating the development of placental abnormalities after ZIKV infection. Hyperplasia of Hofbauer cells (HCs) was also observed in these third-Trimester placental tissues, and remarkably, HCs were the only ZIKV-positive fetal cells found in the placentas studied that persisted until birth, as revealed by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Thirty-Three percent of women infected during pregnancy delivered infants with congenital abnormalities, although no pattern correlating the gestational stage at infection, the IHC positivity of HCs in placental tissues and the presence of congenital malformations at birth was observed. Placental tissue analysis enabled us to confirm maternal ZIKV infection in cases where serum from the acute infection phase was not available, which reinforces the importance of this technique in identifying possible causal factors of birth defects. The results we observed in the samples from naturally infected pregnant women may contribute to the understanding of some aspects of the pathophysiology of ZIKV.

N2  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with brain development abnormalities such as primary microcephaly, a severe reduction in brain growth. Here we demonstrated in vivo the impact of congenital ZIKV infection in blood vessel development, a crucial step in organogenesis. ZIKV was injected intravenously in the pregnant type 2 interferon (IFN)-deficient mouse at embryonic day (E) 12.5. The embryos were collected at E15.5 and postnatal day (P)2. Immunohistochemistry for cortical progenitors and neuronal markers at E15.5 showed the reduction of both populations as a result of ZIKV infection. Using confocal 3D imaging, we found that ZIKV infected brain sections displayed a reduction in the vasculature density and vessel branching compared to mocks at E15.5; altogether, cortical vessels presented a comparatively immature pattern in the infected tissue. These impaired vascular patterns were also apparent in the placenta and retina. Moreover, proteomic analysis has shown that angiogenesis proteins are deregulated in the infected brains compared to controls. At P2, the cortical size and brain weight were reduced in comparison to mock-infected animals. In sum, our results indicate that ZIKV impairs angiogenesis in addition to neurogenesis during development. The vasculature defects represent a limitation for general brain growth but also could regulate neurogenesis directly.

N2  - Maternal alcoholism can induce serious injuries in embryonic and fetal development. The metabolism of alcohol increases the production of free radicals and acetaldehyde, molecules capable of reacting with DNA, impairing organogenesis. Melatonin is a powerful antioxidant that can act as a protective agent against DNA damage caused by genotoxic agents, such as ethanol. This study evaluated the protective effect of exogenous melatonin in rats and their offspring on the genotoxic response induced by chronic alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Twenty-five pregnant rats were divided into the following groups: NC - Negative control; ET - Rats receiving ethanol (3 g/kg/day); ET+10 M - Rats receiving ethanol (3 g/kg/day) and melatonin (10 mg/kg/day); ET+15 M - Rats receiving ethanol (3 g/kg/day) and melatonin (15 mg/kg/day); PC - Positive control (40 mg/kg cyclophosphamide). The dams and 10 pups (five males and five females) from each group were anesthetized to collect blood and liver from the dams and blood, liver and brain of neonates to evaluate the frequency of DNA damage by the comet assay. Blood was also used for the micronucleus test. The results demonstrated a significant increase in DNA damage in the blood and liver cells of dams receiving ethanol and their offspring as well as in the brain of these neonates. Treatments with melatonin (10 and 15 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced the genotoxicity caused by ethanol in the blood of dams and neonates (males and females), liver of dams and male offsprings, and in the brain of female offsprings. It was shown that only the female offspring exposed to maternal alcohol consumption showed a higher frequency of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes. Consequently, exogenous melatonin may be a promising therapeutic agent against genotoxic damage induced by alcohol; however, further studies are needed to confirm these benefits.

N2  - α-Tocopherol (α-Toc) overload increases the risk of dying in humans (E.R. Miller III et al. Meta-analysis: high-dosage vitamin E supplementation may increase all-cause mortality Ann Int Med. 142 (2005) 37–46), and overload during early development leads to elevation of blood pressure at adult life, but the mechanism(s) remains unknown. We hypothesized that α-Toc overload during organogenesis affects the renal renin angiotensin system (RAS) components and renal Na+ handling, culminating with late elevated blood pressure. Pregnant Wistar rats received α-Toc or the superoxide dismutase mimetic tempol throughout pregnancy. We evaluated components of the intrarenal renin angiotensin system in neonate and juvenile offspring: Ang II-positive cells, Ang II receptors (AT1 and AT2), linked protein kinases, O2[rad]− production, NADPH oxidase abundance, lipid peroxidation and activity of Na+-transporting ATPases. In juvenile offspring we followed the evolution of arterial blood pressure. Neonates from α-Toc and tempol mothers presented with accentuated retardment in tubular development, pronounced decrease in glomerular Ang II-positive cells and AT1/AT2 ratio, intense production of O2[rad]− and upregulation of the α, ε and λ PKC isoforms. α-Toc decreased or augmented the abundance of renal (Na++K+)ATPase depending on the age and α-Toc dose. In juvenile rats the number of Ang II-positive cells returned to control values as well as PKCα, but co-existing with marked upregulation in the activity of (Na++K+) and Na+-ATPase and elevated arterial pressure at 30 days. We conclude that the mechanisms of these alterations rely on selective targeting of renal RAS components through genic and pro-oxidant effects of the vitamin.

N2  - Background Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated in Uganda in 1947. In Brazil, the first reported case of ZIKV infection was in May 2015. Additionally, dengue (DENV) is endemic and there has been a recent outbreak of chikungunya (CHIKV). Since the clinical manifestations of different arboviral infections (AI) can be similar, definitive diagnosis requires laboratory testing. Objectives To determine the prevalence of ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV infections in a Brazilian cohort of HIV-infected pregnant women, to assess clinical/immunological characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of women with evidence of recent AI. Study design Laboratory diagnosis of ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV infections utilized serological assays, RT-PCR and PRNT. The tests were performed at the first visit, 34–36 weeks of gestation and at any time if a woman had symptoms suggestive of AI. Mann-Whitney tests were used for comparison of medians, Chi-square or Fisher’s to compare proportions; p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Poisson regression was used to analyze risk factors for central nervous system (CNS) malformations in the infant according to maternal symptomatology. Results Of 219 HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled, 92% were DENV IgG+; 47(22%) had laboratory evidence of recent AI. Of these, 34 (72%) were ZIKV+, nine (19%) CHIKV+, and two (4%) DENV+. Symptoms consistent with AI were observed in 23 (10%) women, of whom 10 (43%) were ZIKV+, eight (35%) CHIKV+. No CNS abnormalities were observed among infants of DENV+ or CHIKV+ women; four infants with CNS abnormalities were born to ZIKV+ women (three symptomatic). Infants born to ZIKV+ women had a higher risk of CNS malformations if the mother was symptomatic (RR = 7.20), albeit not statistically significant (p = 0.066). Conclusions Among HIV-infected pregnant women with laboratory evidence of a recent AI, 72% were ZIKV-infected. In this cohort, CNS malformations occurred among infants born to both symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant women with Zika infection.

N2  - Objectives: We aimed to report the first 54 cases of pregnant women infected by Zika virus (ZIKV) and their virologic and clinical outcomes, as well as their newborns’ outcomes, in 2016, after the emergence of ZIKV in dengue-endemic areas of São Paulo, Brazil. Methods: This descriptive study was performed from February to October 2016 on 54 quantitative real-time PCR ZIKV-positive pregnant women identified by the public health authority of São José do Rio Preto, São Paulo, Brazil. The women were followed and had clinical and epidemiologic data collected before and after birth. Adverse outcomes in newborns were analysed and reported. Urine or blood samples from newborns were collected to identify ZIKV infection by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Results: A total of 216 acute Zika-suspected pregnant women were identified, and 54 had the diagnosis confirmed by RT-PCR. None of the 54 women miscarried. Among the 54 newborns, 15 exhibited adverse outcomes at birth. The highest number of ZIKV infections occurred during the second and third trimesters. No cases of microcephaly were reported, though a broad clinical spectrum of outcomes, including lenticulostriate vasculopathy, subependymal cysts, and auditory and ophthalmologic disorders, were identified. ZIKV RNA was detected in 18 of 51 newborns tested and in eight of 15 newborns with adverse outcomes. Conclusions: Although other studies have associated many newborn outcomes to ZIKV infection during pregnancy, these same adverse outcomes were rare or nonexistent in this study. The clinical presentation the newborns we studied was mild compared to other reports, suggesting that there is significant heterogeneity in congenital Zika infection.

N2  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by impairments in both social communication and interaction and repetitive or stereotyped behaviors. Although its etiology remains unknown, genetic and environmental risk factors have been associated with this disorder, including the exposure to valproic acid (VPA) during pregnancy. Resveratrol (RSV) is an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant molecule known to prevent social impairments in the VPA animal model of autism. This study aimed to analyze the effects of prenatal exposure to VPA, as well as possible preventive effects of RSV, on sensory behavior, the localization of GABAergic parvalbumin (PV+) neurons in sensory brain regions and the expression of proteins of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Pregnant rats were treated daily with RSV (3.6 mg/kg) from E6.5 to E18.5 and injected with VPA (600 mg/kg) in the E12.5. Male pups were analyzed in Nest Seeking (NS) behavior and in whisker nuisance task (WNT). At P30, the tissues were removed and analyzed by immunofluorescence and western blotting. Our data showed for the first time an altered localization of PV+-neurons in primary sensory cortex and amygdala. We also showed a reduced level of gephyrin in the primary somatosensory area (PSSA) of VPA animals. The treatment with RSV prevented all the aforementioned alterations triggered by VPA. Our data shed light on the relevance of sensory component in ASD and highlights the interplay between RSV and VPA animal model as an important tool to investigate the pathophysiology of ASD.

N2  - Background The presence of antiretroviral drug-associated resistance mutations (DRMs) may be particularly problematic in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected pregnant women as it can lead to mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of resistant HIV strains. This study evaluated the prevalence and the effect of antiretroviral DRMs in previously untreated mother-infant pairs. Methods A case-control design of 1:4 (1 transmitter to 4 nontransmitters) was utilized to evaluate DRMs as a predictor of HIV MTCT in specimens obtained from mother-infant pairs. ViroSeq HIV-1 genotyping was performed on mother-infant specimens to assess for clinically relevant DRMs. Results One hundred forty infants acquired HIV infection; of these, 123 mother-infant pairs (88%) had specimens successfully amplified using ViroSeq and assessed for drug resistance genotyping. Additionally, 483 of 560 (86%) women who did not transmit HIV to infants also had samples evaluated for DRMs. Sixty-three of 606 (10%) women had clinically relevant DRMs; 12 (2%) had DRMs against >1 drug class. Among 123 HIV-infected infants, 13 (11%) had clinically relevant DRMs, with 3 (2%) harboring DRMs against >1 drug class. In univariate and multivariate analyses, DRMs in mothers were not associated with increased HIV MTCT (adjusted odds ratio, 0.8 [95% confidence interval,.4-1.5]). Presence of DRMs in transmitting mothers was strongly associated with DRM presence in their infants (P <.001). Conclusions Preexisting DRMs were common in untreated HIV-infected pregnant women, but did not increase the risk of HIV MTCT. However, if women with DRMs are not virologically suppressed, they may transmit resistant mutations, thus complicating infant management.

N2  - Background: Streptococcus agalactiae or Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains the leading cause of infections in newborns worldwilde. Prenatal GBS screening of pregnant women for vaginal-rectal colonization is recommended in many countries to manage appropriate intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis for those identified as carriers. In this study, a novel melting-curve based multiplex real-time PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of GBS and macrolide and lincosamide resistance markers was developed. The usefulness of the assay was evaluated for rapid and accurate prenatal GBS screening. Methods: One hundred two pregnant women who were at 35-37 weeks of gestation were enrolled in this study. The analytical performance of the multiplex real-time PCR was first tested using a panel of reference and clinical bacterial and fungal strains. To test the clinical performance, vaginal-rectal swabs were obtained from pregnant women who were seen at the teaching hospital for regular prenatal care. The results of real-time were compared with those obtained from microbiological analyses. Results: The real-time PCR assay showed 100% specificity and a limit of detection of 104 colony forming units equivalent per reaction. The prevalence of GBS colonization among the population studied was 15.7% (16/102) based on a positive culture and the real-time PCR results. Agreement between the two assays was found for 11 (68.75%) GBS colonized women. Using the culture-based results as a reference, the multiplex real-time PCR had a sensitivity of 91.7% (11/12, CI 59.7-99.6%), a specificity of 95.5% (86/90, CI 89.8-98.7%), a positive predictive value of 73.3% (11/15, CI 44.8-91.1%) and a negative predictive value of 98.9% (86/87, CI 92.9-99.9%). Conclusion: The multiplex real-time PCR is a rapid, affordable and sensitive assay for direct detection of GBS in vaginal-rectal swabs.

N2  - Background: Pregnant women with sporotrichosis should not receive systemic antifungal therapy except in severe cases when amphotericin B is recommended. Thermotherapy is the most reported treatment described in this group of patients. It entails weeks of daily self-application of heat to the lesions, requires that the patient faithfully apply it, and it could cause skin burns. Cryosurgery is a useful therapeutic tool for many cutaneous infectious diseases, safe for pregnant women, but not well evaluated for sporotrichosis treatment in this group. Methodology: The authors conducted a retrospective study describing epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic data related to four pregnant patients with sporotrichosis treated with cryosurgery. The authors reviewed the clinical records of four pregnant patients diagnosed with cutaneous sporotrichosis and treated with cryosurgery. The sessions were carried out monthly up to clinical cure. Molecular identification of the Sporothrix species was performed in two cases using T3B PCR fingerprinting assays. Principal findings: All patients were in the second trimester of pregnancy and their age ranged from 18 to 34 years. With regard to clinical presentation, two patients had lymphocutaneous and two had the fixed form. S. brasiliensis was identified in two cases as the causative agent. Cryosurgery was well tolerated and the number of sessions ranged from 1 to 3. All the patients reached a complete clinical cure. Conclusions: Cryosurgery was a safe, easy to perform and well tolerated method, and therefore it is suggested to be a suitable option for the treatment of cutaneous sporotrichosis in pregnant women.

N2  - Aims: To evaluate the predictive factors of birth weight (BW) of newborns of women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed among pregnant women with GDM treated in a public maternity unit, Brazil. We selected 283 pregnant women, with nutritional follow-up initiated till the 28th gestational week, singleton pregnancy, without chronic diseases and with birth weight information of the newborns. The predictive factors of BW were identified by multivariate linear regression. Results: Mean maternal age was 31.2 ± 5.8 years; 64.4% were non-white; 70.1% were pre-gestational overweight or obese. Mean BW was 3234.3 ± 478.8 g. An increase of 1 kg of weight in the first and third trimesters increased BW by 21 g (p = 0.01) and 27 g (p = 0.03), respectively. Similarly, the other predictive factors of BW were pre-gestational body mass index (β = 17.16, p = 0.02) and postprandial plasma glucose in the third trimester (β = 4.14, p = 0.008), in the model adjusted by gestational age at delivery (β = 194.68, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The best predictors of BW were gestational age at birth, and maternal pre-gestational and gestational anthropometric characteristics. Maternal glycaemic levels may also influence BW. The results may contribute to a review of prenatal routines for pregnant women with GDM.

N2  - Purpose: To characterize the physiological changes in 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] throughout pregnancy. Methods: Prospective cohort of 229 apparently healthy pregnant women followed at 5th–13th, 20th–26th, and 30th–36th gestational weeks. 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D concentrations were measured by LC–MS/MS. Statistical analyses included longitudinal linear mixed-effects models adjusted for parity, season, education, self-reported skin color, and pre-pregnancy BMI. Vitamin D status was defined based on 25(OH)D concentrations according to the Endocrine Society Practice Guideline and Institute of Medicine (IOM) for adults. Results: The prevalence of 25(OH)D <75 nmol/L was 70.4, 41.0, and 33.9%; the prevalence of 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L was 16.1, 11.2, and 10.2%; and the prevalence of 25(OH)D <30 nmol/L was 2, 0, and 0.6%, at the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively. Unadjusted analysis showed an increase in 25(OH)D (β = 0.869; 95% CI 0.723–1.014; P < 0.001) and 1,25(OH)2D (β = 3.878; 95% CI 3.136–4.620; P < 0.001) throughout pregnancy. Multiple adjusted analyses showed that women who started the study in winter (P < 0.001), spring (P < 0.001), or autumn (P = 0.028) presented a longitudinal increase in 25(OH)D concentrations, while women that started during summer did not. Increase of 1,25(OH)2D concentrations over time in women with insufficient vitamin D (50–75 nmol/L) at baseline was higher compared to women with sufficient vitamin D (≥75 nmol/L) (P = 0.006). Conclusions: The prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy varied significantly according to the adopted criteria. There was a seasonal variation of 25(OH)D during pregnancy. The women with insufficient vitamin D status present greater longitudinal increases in the concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D in comparison to women with sufficiency.

N2  - AIMS: The aim of the study is to verify the knowledge and practices of health professionals working in prenatal care (PNC) related with syphilis during pregnancy and to identify the main barriers to the implementation of protocols for the control of this disease. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in Teresina, Brazil, from January to May 2015, was conducted with 366 physicians and nurses working in PNC, corresponding to 70% of eligible professionals. We evaluated 20 knowledge and practice criteria related to the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis during pregnancy with a 95% compliance standard. We performed descriptive analysis of the data and used χ2 statistical test to verify differences according to professional category. RESULTS: Only 2 criteria, "knowledge about mother to child transmission according to gestational age" and "counselling on infection," reached 95% compliance. Knowledge of the epidemiological profile of congenital syphilis and the goal of elimination of congenital syphilis and knowledge about serological tests had scores below 50%, while practices related with posttest counselling, cure control, and treatment of partners reached 60%. We identified organisational barriers related to the late initiation of PNC, to the delayed return of syphilis test results, to the application of benzathine penicillin in primary care units and to the treatment of partners. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies for early initiation of PNC, implementation of rapid tests for syphilis, ensuring treatment of pregnant women with penicillin, adequate partner treatment, and continued education of health professionals on clinical management and counselling in sexually transmitted diseases are necessary to eliminate congenital syphilis.

N2  - Background: Antenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) is related to severe neurological manifestations. A previous study in Brazil reported an increased incidence of non-severe congenital heart defects in infants with diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome but without laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection in the mother or infant. The objective of this study is to report echocardiographic (ECHO) findings in infants with laboratory confirmed antenatal exposure to ZIKV. Methodology: Cross sectional study of cardiologic assessments of infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to ZIKV in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Results: The study enrolled 120 children with a median age of 97 days (1 to 376 days). In utero exposure to ZIKV was confirmed in 97 children (80,8%) through positive maternal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results during pregnancy or a positive PCR result at birth; 23 additional children (19.2%) had maternal positive PCR results during pregnancy and postnatally. Forty- eight infants (40%) had cardiac defects noted on ECHO. Thirteen infants (10.8%) had major cardiac defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). None of the defects were severe. The frequency of major defects was higher in infants whose mothers had a rash in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, or who had altered Central Nervous System (CNS) imaging postnatally or were preterm. Conclusions: Infants with in utero ZIKV exposure have a higher prevalence of major cardiac defects, however none were severe enough to require immediate intervention. For this reason, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow general newborn screening guidelines, which significantly reduces the burden of performing emergent fetal or neonatal ECHOs in a setting where resources are not available, such as most Brazilian municipalities.

N2  - The use of natural and synthetic repellents, marketed in different pharmaceutical forms, is growing in the world due to the emerging vector-borne viral diseases as Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, Yellow Fever and Malaria. The choice of the ideal formulation will depend on a series of factors to be analyzed: type of repellent active (natural or synthetic), pharmaceutical forms (spray, lotion, cream, gel), action time duration (short or long), environment of exposure and the user (adult, pregnant women, children, newborn). The most used repellents are DEET, IR3535 (Ethyl Butylacetylaminopropionate) (EB), Icaridin (Picaridin) and essential oils, each of them presenting advantages and disadvantages. DEET is the oldest and the most powerful repellent available in the market, thus being the reference standard. For this reason, there are many classic formulations available in the market containing the chemical component DEET in spray forms and lotions. However, due to its toxicity, DEET is not recommended for children up to 6 months and pregnant women. DEET has been an option along with other market-shared products as IR3535 and Icaridin (Picaridin), which present less toxicity in their composition. IR3535 is the less toxic and may be prescribed for children over 6 months of age and pregnant women so that they have been the best option because of the lower toxicity levels presented. IR3535 is the one that has the lowest toxicity level among the three options and may be prescribed for children above 6 months of age and pregnant women. Icaridin is as potent as DEET, but less toxic, and has the advantage of having the long-lasting action among the aforementioned repellents. The new formulations have been based on controlled release systems (CRS). The CRSs for repellents comprise polymer micro/nanocapsules, micro/solid lipid nanoparticles, nanoemulsions/microemulsions, liposomes/niosomes, nanostructured hydrogels and cyclodextrins. There are many formulations based on micro and nanocapsules containing DEET and essential oils to increase repellent action time duration and decrease permeation and consequently, systemic toxicity. The development of new formulations for the IR3535 and Icaridin is a research field yet to be explored. The current trend is the use of natural repellent actives such as essential oils, which present low toxicity, do not harm the environment, but present reduced repellent action time due to rapid evaporation after skin application. CRSs have been used as vehicle of natural repellents to improve long-lasting repellent action, reduce skin permeation and systemic effects.

N2  - To undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the test performance including sensitivity and specificity of rapid immunochromatographic syphilis (ICS) point-of-care (POC) tests at antenatal clinics compared with reference standard tests (non-treponemal (TP) and TP tests) for active syphilis in pregnant women. Methods Five electronic databases were searched (PubMed, EMBASE, CRD, Cochrane Library and LILACS) to March 2016 for diagnostic accuracy studies of ICS test and standard reference tests for syphilis in pregnant women. Methodological quality was assessed using QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies). A bivariate meta-analysis was undertaken to generate pooled estimates of diagnostic parameters. Results were presented using a coupled forest plot of sensitivity and specificity and a scatter plot. Results The methodological quality of the five included studies with regards to risk of bias and applicability concern judgements was either low or unclear. One study was judged as high risk of bias for patient selection due to exclusion of pregnant women with a previous history of syphilis, and one study was judged at high risk of bias for study flow and timing as not all patients were included in the analysis. Five studies contributed to the meta-analysis, providing a pooled sensitivity and specificity for ICS of 0.85 (95% CrI: 0.73 to 0.92) and 0.98 (95% CrI: 0.95 to 0.99), respectively. Conclusions This review and meta-analysis observed that rapid ICS POC tests have a high sensitivity and specificity when performed in pregnant women at antenatal clinics. However, the methodological quality of the existing evidence base should be taken into consideration when interpreting these results. PROSPERO registration number CRD42016036335.

N2  - Background: Zika virus (ZIKV) has been identified in several body fluids of infected individuals. In most cases, it remained detected in blood from few days to 1 week after the onset of symptoms, and can persist longer in urine and in semen. ZIKV infection can have dramatic consequences such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. ZIKV sexual transmission has been documented. A better understanding of ZIKV presence and persistence across biologic compartments is needed to devise rational measures to prevent its transmission. Methods: This observational cohort study will recruit non-pregnant participants aged 18 years and above with confirmed ZIKV infection [positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test in blood and/or urine]: symptomatic men and women in ZIKV infection acute phase, and their symptomatic or asymptomatic household/sexual infected contacts. Specimens of blood, urine, semen, vaginal secretion/menstrual blood, rectal swab, oral fluids, tears, sweat, urine and breast milk (if applicable) will be collected at pre-established intervals and tested for ZIKV RNA presence by RT-PCR, other co-infection (dengue, Chikungunya, HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis), antibody response (including immunoglobulins M and G), plaque reduction neutralization test (if simultaneously positive for ZIKV and dengue), and ZIKV culture and RNA sequencing. Data on socio-demographic characteristics and comorbidities will be collected in parallel. Participants will be followed up for 12 months. Discussion: This prolonged longitudinal follow-up of ZIKV infected persons with regular biologic testing and data collection will offer a unique opportunity to investigate the presence and persistence of ZIKV in various biologic compartments, their clinical and immunological correlates as well as the possibility of ZIKV reactivation/reinfection over time. This valuable information will substantially contribute to the body of knowledge on ZIKV infection and serve as a base for the development of more effective recommendation on the prevention of ZIKV transmission.

N2  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently caused a pandemic disease, and many cases of ZIKV infection in pregnant women resulted in abortion, stillbirth, deaths and congenital defects including microcephaly, which now has been proposed as ZIKV congenital syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the in situ immune response profile and mechanisms of neuronal cell damage in fatal Zika microcephaly cases. Brain tissue samples were collected from 15 cases, including 10 microcephalic ZIKV-positive neonates with fatal outcome and five neonatal control flavivirus-negative neonates that died due to other causes, but with preserved central nervous system (CNS) architecture. In microcephaly cases, the histopathological features of the tissue samples were characterized in three CNS areas (meninges, perivascular space, and parenchyma). The changes found were mainly calcification, necrosis, neuronophagy, gliosis, microglial nodules, and inflammatory infiltration of mononuclear cells. The in situ immune response against ZIKV in the CNS of newborns is complex. Despite the predominant expression of Th2 cytokines, other cytokines such as Th1, Th17, Treg, Th9, and Th22 are involved to a lesser extent, but are still likely to participate in the immunopathogenic mechanisms of neural disease in fatal cases of microcephaly caused by ZIKV.

N2  - In this review, we give an overview of aspects related to the congenital transmission of the Zika virus (ZIKV). Although we acknowledge that important advances in research on ZIKV pathogenesis have come from studies using animal models, particularly non-human primates, this review emphasizes studies using ex-vivo human cells and tissues as well as natural infections in pregnant women. The possible routes used by ZIKV to cross or breach the placental barrier and infect the fetal central nervous system are presented. Understanding the viral infection biology and ZIKV pathogenesis during pregnancy may guide the design of affordable antiviral strategies to benefit pregnant women in areas at risk.

N2  - Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the association between periodontitis in pregnant women and adverse pregnancy outcomes by heeding confounding risk factors for preterm low birth weight infants. Methods: This study was reported according to The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement. A case–control study was conducted. Medical records of all pregnant women attending a prenatal care clinic were screened. Those between 21 and 34 years and gestational age of 28–32 weeks were initially enrolled in the study. The exclusion criteria were then applied: diabetes mellitus, genitourinary tract infections, or HIV infection; previous multiple gestations; previous preterm birth/low birth weight infants; in vitro fertilization procedures; placental, cervical/uterine abnormalities; history of infertility; history of drug abuse; and any medical conditions that required antibiotics prophylaxis. Patients’ anthropometric, demographic, and behavioral characteristics were collected. The periodontal clinical parameters were obtained from six sites per tooth: clinical attachment level, probing pocket depth, dental plaque index, and gingival bleeding index. Women were then allocated into two groups: mothers of preterm and/or low birth weight newborns (cases) and mothers of full-term and normal birth weight newborns (controls). Results: Periodontal clinical parameters were analyzed and reported separately for each group, and no significant differences were observed (p > 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that periodontal clinical parameters were not associated with the adverse pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion(s): After controlling for confounding factors, our results suggest that maternal periodontal disease is not a risk factor associated with preterm low birth weight infants.

N2  - Chagas disease afflicts 7 to 8 million people worldwide and congenital Chagas' disease usually leads to changes in the maternal environment, culminating in fetal adaptations. Several articles have described the importance of micronutrients on pregnancy, which is sensitive to infections. In Trypanosoma cruzi endemic regions, the Chagas disease is aggravated by the lack of micronutrients in an average diet, to which pregnant women are more susceptible. The aim of this study was to evaluate distinct T cells phenotypes and intracellular cytokines by flow cytometry in pregnant Wistar rats under zinc therapy during experimental Chagas' disease. Twenty female Wistar rats were infected with 1 × 105 blood trypomastigotes (Y strain) and 30 days after infection the animals were mated and grouped: pregnant infected (PI–n = 5), pregnant infected/zinc supplied (PIZ–n = 5), pregnant control (PC–n = 5), control/zinc supplied (PCZ–n = 5). Zinc supplementation: 20 mg of zinc/Kg/day (gavage) for 18 days followed by euthanasia. The immune parameters showed: decreased percentages of CD62LlowCD44high surface marker for infected and treated group (PIZ) when compared to PI (p < 0.05). Concerning to T regulatory cells (Treg cells), a significantly lower percentage of splenic Treg cells was found in the infected and treated group (PIZ) as compared to the PI group (p < 0.05). The expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD28+ displayed a significant reduced percentage in TCD8+ for infected and zinc treated group (PIZ) as compared to (PI). The percentages of CD4+/CD11a+ T cells subsets were lower on PIZ as compared to PI. Concerning to CD45RA+ (B lymphocytes) analysis, infected pregnant and treated group (PIZ) showed a significant decrease in CD45RA percentage when compared to (PI) (p < 0.05). The intracellular cytokine profiles for TCD4+ and TCD8+ producing IL-4 and IFN-γ revealed that zinc treated and untreated infected pregnant group (PI and PIZ) displayed increased cytokines concentrations as compared to zinc treated and untreated pregnant controls (PC and PCZ). Our data revealed the involvement of zinc as a signaling molecule in the modulation of the inflammatory process and immune response which occurs during pregnancy of T. cruzi infected rats. Zinc acted in a dual fashion, modulating the host's immune response in a way to protect the organism against the deleterious effects of the infection and an overwhelming pro-inflammatory response during pregnancy.

N2  - Objective: We evaluated the effect of Trypanosoma cruzi infection on fertility, gestation outcome, and maternal-fetal transmission in guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus). Methods: Animals were infected with T. cruzi H4 strain (TcI lineage) before gestation (IBG) or during gestation (IDG). Tissue and sera samples of dams and fetuses were obtained near parturition. Results: All IBG and IDG dams were seropositive by two tests, and exhibited blood parasite load of 1.62±2.2 and 50.1±62 parasites/μl, respectively, by quantitative PCR. Histological evaluation showed muscle fiber degeneration and cellular necrosis in all infected dams. Parasite nests were not detected in infected dams by histology. However, qPCR analysis detected parasites-eq/g heart tissue of 153±104.7 and 169.3±129.4 in IBG and IDG dams, respectively. All fetuses of infected dams were positive for anti-parasite IgG antibodies and tissue parasites by qPCR, but presented a low level of tissue inflammatory infiltrate. Fetuses of IDG (vs. IBG) dams exhibited higher degree of muscle fiber degeneration and cellular necrosis in the heart and skeletal tissues. The placental tissue exhibited no inflammatory lesions and amastigote nests, yet parasites-eq/g of 381.2±34.3 and 79.2±84.9 were detected in IDG and IBG placentas, respectively. Fetal development was compromised, and evidenced by a decline in weight, crow-rump length, and abdominal width in both groups. Conclusions: T. cruzi TcI has a high capacity of congenital transmission even when it was inoculated at a very low dose before or during gestation. Tissue lesions, parasite load, and fetal under development provide evidence for high virulence of the parasite during pregnancy. Despite finding of high parasite burden by qPCR, placentas were protected from cellular damage. Our studies offer an experimental model to study the efficacy of vaccines and drugs against congenital transmission of T. cruzi. These results also call for T. cruzi screening in pregnant women and adequate follow up of the newborns in endemic areas.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the coverage of the reporting of cases of HIV-infected pregnant women, to estimate the increase in the coverage of the reporting with the routine search of data in other Brazilian health information systems, and to identify missed opportunities for identification of HIV-infected pregnant women in Brazilian maternity hospitals.
METHODS: This is a descriptive study on the linkage of Brazilian databases with primary data from the "Nascer no Brasil" study and secondary database collection from national health information systems. The "Nascer no Brasil" is a national-based study carried out in 2011-2012 with 23,894 pregnant women, which identified HIV-infected pregnant women using prenatal and medical records. We searched for cases of HIV-infected pregnant women identified in the "Nascer no Brasil" study in the Information System of Notifiable Diseases, the Control System for Laboratory Tests of the National CD4+/CD8+ Lymphocyte Count and HIV Viral Load Network, and the Logistics Control System for Medications. We used the OpenRecLink software for the linkage of databases. We estimated the notification coverage, with the respective confidence interval, of the evaluated Brazilian health information systems.
RESULTS: We estimated the coverage of the reporting of HIV-infected pregnant women in the Information System of Notifiable Diseases as 57.1% (95%CI 42.9-70.2), and we located 89.3% of the HIV-infected pregnant women (95%CI 81.2-94.2) in some of the Brazilian health information systems researched. The search in other national health information systems would result in an increase of 57.1% of the reported cases. We identified no missed opportunities for the diagnosis of HIV+ in pregnant women in the maternity hospitals evaluated by the "Nascer no Brasil" study.
CONCLUSIONS: The routine search for information in other Brazilian health information systems, a procedure carried out by the Ministry of Health for cases of AIDS in adults and children, should be adopted for cases of HIV in pregnancy.

N2  - Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is regularly found among particular people living in Central and South America. Paediatric Chagas disease occurs in 1-10% of infants of infected mothers. The major important point considered in the treatment of congenital Chagas disease focuses on killing the parasite in acute infection and managing signs and symptoms in later stages. Nowadays, two drugs benznidazole and nifurtimox are currently available in the market for the treatment of paediatric Chagas disease.

N2  - Purpose of review Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of death in people living with HIV (PLHIV) despite the achievements in antiretroviral therapy coverage. TB preventive therapy (TPT) has proved efficacy but has been neglected and poorly implemented. We reviewed recent publications and guidelines about TPT in PLHIV. Recent findings High-quality studies showed that TPT has a durable effect, over 5 years, preventing TB and all-cause mortality. There is new evidence showing the noninferiority of shorter, rifamycin-based regimens of TPT increasing the options for treatment. Recent studies describing robust implementation in different settings showed promising results for feasibility, tolerance, retention, and cost-effectiveness. New WHO recommendations, unifying previous versions, have been released to guide countries implementation. Summary New evidence support the scale up of TPT for PLHIV globally, further studies are needed to bring more evidence for specific populations, like pregnant women and for drug–drug interactions with antiretroviral agents.

N2  - Plasma concentrations of vitamin D metabolites can be inversely associated with depressive symptoms. However, few longitudinal studies have investigated this association, especially during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25-dihydroxivitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] with the occurrence of depressive symptoms throughout pregnancy. A prospective cohort of 179 women was followed at 5th-13th, 20th-26th and 30th-36th gestational weeks. At each trimester of pregnancy, the plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy. Vitamin D status was categorized according to the Endocrine Society Practice Guidelines and the Institute of Medicine. Depressive symptoms were measured at each trimester using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depressive Scale (cutoff ≥13). Statistical analyses included random intercept logistic regression models for longitudinal analyses. In the first trimester, the prevalence of 25(OH)D <75, <50 and <30 nmol/L were 69.3%, 14.0% and 1.7%, respectively. Prevalence of depressive symptoms were 20.1%, 14.7% and 7.8% for the first, second and third trimesters, respectively. The probability of occurrence of depressive symptoms decreased throughout pregnancy (p-value = 0.005). Women with higher concentrations of 25(OH)D in the first trimester presented a lower odds ratio (OR) for the development of depressive symptoms during pregnancy (OR = 0.98; 95%CI: 0.96 to 0.99, p-value = 0.047) in the adjusted model. In conclusion, there was a higher prevalence of vitamin D inadequacy and depressive symptoms during the first trimester. Higher 25(OH)D concentrations in the first trimester were associated with a decrease of 2% in the odds for presenting depressive symptoms throughout pregnancy.

N2  - Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause congenital abnormities or fetal demise. The persistence of Zika virus in the male reproductive system poses a risk of sexual transmission. Here we demonstrate that live-attenuated Zika virus vaccine candidates containing deletions in the 3′ untranslated region of the Zika virus genome (ZIKV-3′UTR-LAV) prevent viral transmission during pregnancy and testis damage in mice, as well as infection of nonhuman primates. After a single-dose vaccination, pregnant mice challenged with Zika virus at embryonic day 6 and evaluated at embryonic day 13 show markedly diminished levels of viral RNA in maternal, placental, and fetal tissues. Vaccinated male mice challenged with Zika virus were protected against testis infection, injury, and oligospermia. A single immunization of rhesus macaques elicited a rapid and robust antibody response, conferring complete protection upon challenge. Furthermore, the ZIKV-3′UTR-LAV vaccine candidates have a desirable safety profile. These results suggest that further development of ZIKV-3′UTR-LAV is warranted for humans.

N2  - This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of syphilis and HIV infection during pregnancy, the mother to child transmission of syphilis and the incidence of congenital syphilis in incarcerated women in Brazil; to compare these rates to those observed in pregnant women outside of jail; and to verify the maternal factors associated with syphilis infection during pregnancy in free and incarcerated women. We used data from two nationwide studies conducted during the period 2011-2014. The Birth in Brazil study included 23,894 free women cared for in 266 hospitals. The Maternal and Infant Health in Prisons study included 495 incarcerated pregnant women or mothers living with their children, according to a census conducted in 33 female prisons. The same case definitions and data collection methods were used in both studies. The chi-square test was used to compare the characteristics of incarcerated and free women with a significance of 0.05. For incarcerated women, the estimated prevalence of syphilis during pregnancy was 8.7% (95%CI: 5.7-13.1) and for HIV infection 3.3% (95%CI: 1.7-6.6); the estimated mother to child transmission of syphilis was 66.7% (95%CI: 44.7-83.2) and the incidence of congenital syphilis was 58.1 per 1,000 living newborns (95%CI: 40.4-82.8). Incarcerated women had a greater prevalence of syphilis and HIV infection during pregnancy, lower quality of antenatal care and higher levels of social vulnerability. Syphilis infection showed to be an indicator of social vulnerability in free women, but not in incarcerated women. Health initiatives in prison are necessary to reduce healthcare inequalities and should include adequate antenatal and birth care.

N2  - Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in leptin (LEP) and leptin receptor (LEPR) have been shown to be linked to obesity-related metabolic markers and phenotype. Therefore, we hypothesized that the LEP-rs7799039 and LEPR-rs1137101 SNPs are related to the risk of pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity (body mass index ≥25 kg/m2) as well as to excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) and high concentrations of leptin throughout pregnancy. We investigated a prospective cohort of 147 Brazilian pregnant women through weeks 5-13, 20-26, and 30-36 of gestation. Genetic variants of LEP and LEPR were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and leptin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical analyses included multiple linear regression, linear mixed effects, and Poisson regression models. Genotype AA carriers for the LEP-rs7799039 gene maintained a lower body weight throughout pregnancy compared with those with genotypes GG or GA + GG (βAAvsGG = −7.91 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI], −14.21 to −1.61; P =.01; and βAAvsGA + GG = −7.66 kg; 95% CI, −14.07 to −1.25; P =.02). The A allele was significantly associated with an increased risk for excessive GWG (relative riskLEP-GAvsGG, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.23-3.80; and relative riskLEP-AAvsGG, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.04-5.39). Neither the LEP-rs7799039 nor LEPR-rs1137101 SNP was significantly associated with pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity risk and leptin concentrations during pregnancy. In conclusion, our results indicate that women who had the AA genotype for LEP-rs7799039 displayed a lower body weight throughout pregnancy compared with GG or GA + GG carriers. LEP-rs7799039 was significantly associated with an increased risk for excessive GWG, but the results do not support significant associations of the LEP-rs7799039 and LEPR-rs1137101 polymorphisms with pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity risk and leptin concentrations throughout pregnancy.

N2  - Blood CD14+ monocytes are frontline immunomodulators categorized into classical, intermediate or non-classical subsets, and subsequently differentiated into M1 pro- or M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages on stimulation. Although the Zika virus (ZIKV) rapidly establishes viraemia, the target cells and immune responses, particularly during pregnancy, remain elusive. Furthermore, it is unknown whether African- and Asian-lineage ZIKV have different phenotypic impacts on host immune responses. Using human blood infection, we identified CD14+ monocytes as the primary target for African- or Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. When immunoprofiles of human blood infected with ZIKV were compared, a classical/intermediate monocyte-mediated M1-skewed inflammation by the African-lineage ZIKV infection was observed, in contrast to a non-classical monocyte-mediated M2-skewed immunosuppression by the Asian-lineage ZIKV infection. Importantly, infection of the blood of pregnant women revealed an enhanced susceptibility to ZIKV infection. Specifically, Asian-lineage ZIKV infection of pregnant women's blood led to an exacerbated M2-skewed immunosuppression of non-classical monocytes in conjunction with a global suppression of type I interferon-signalling pathway and an aberrant expression of host genes associated with pregnancy complications. Also, 30 ZIKV+ sera from symptomatic pregnant patients showed elevated levels of M2-skewed immunosuppressive cytokines and pregnancy-complication-associated fibronectin-1. This study demonstrates the differential immunomodulatory responses of blood monocytes, particularly during pregnancy, on infection with different lineages of ZIKV.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the association between maternal C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations during pregnancy and birth weight (BW) Z-score. Methods: A prospective cohort of pregnant women were followed at 5–13 (n = 203), 20–26 (n = 181), and 30–36 (n = 181) gestational weeks and at 30–45 d postpartum. Maternal CRP concentrations were assessed three times during pregnancy using immunoturbidimetric methods (ultra-sensitive kits). BW Z-score and newborns classified as small for gestational age (SGA) were evaluated according to Intergrowth-21st curves. Statistical analyses included SGA rates, BW Z-score means (SD) and a two-stage procedure: (1) a linear mixed-effect model (LME) to predict CRP intercept (mean exposure level) and slope (trend of change during pregnancy); and (2) a multiple linear regression model with BW Z-score as the outcome and CRP intercept and slope exposures. Results: A total of 4.4% (n = 9) women delivered SGA newborns. The mean BW was 3282.0 (37.3) g, and the mean gestational age at delivery was 38.8 (0.1) weeks. Women in the third tertile of the CRP rate of change gave birth to infants with a mean BW Z-score that was lower than those in the first/second tertiles (0.226 versus 0.381; p = 0.324). For the adjusted baseline CRP (β = 0.08; 95% CI: 0.03–0.14), the CRP trend of change was inversely associated with the BW Z-score (β= −3.77; 95% CI: −5.45 to −2.10). Conclusions: The maternal CRP trend of change during pregnancy was negatively associated with BW Z-score.

N2  - IMPORTANCE Current guidelines recommend screening eye examinations for infants with microcephaly or laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection but not for all infants potentially exposed to Zika virus in utero. OBJECTIVE To evaluate eye findings in a cohort of infants whose mothers had polymerase chain reaction-confirmed Zika virus infection during pregnancy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this descriptive case series performed from January 2 through October 30, 2016, infants were examined from birth to 1 year of age by a multidisciplinary medical team, including a pediatric ophthalmologist, from Fernandes Figueira Institute, a Ministry of Health referral center for high-risk pregnancies and infectious diseases in children in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS Mother-infant pairs from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who presented with suspected Zika virus infection during pregnancy were referred to our institution and had serum, urine, amniotic fluid, or placenta samples tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction for Zika virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Description of eye findings, presence of microcephaly or other central nervous system abnormalities, and timing of infection in infants with confirmed Zika virus during pregnancy. Eye abnormalities were correlated with central nervous system findings, microcephaly, and the timing of maternal infection. RESULTS Of the 112 with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed Zika virus infection in maternal specimens, 24 infants (21.4%) examined had eye abnormalities (median age at first eye examination, 31 days; range, 0-305 days). Ten infants (41.7%) with eye abnormalities did not have microcephaly, and 8 (33.3%) did not have any central nervous system findings. Fourteen infants with eye abnormalities (58.3%) were born to women infected in the first trimester, 8 (33.3%) in the second trimester, and 2 (8.3%) in the third trimester. Optic nerve and retinal abnormalities were the most frequent findings. Eye abnormalities were statistically associated with microcephaly (odds ratio [OR], 19.1; 95%CI, 6.0-61.0), other central nervous system abnormalities (OR, 4.3; 95%CI, 1.6-11.2), arthrogryposis (OR, 29.0; 95%CI, 3.3-255.8), and maternal trimester of infection (first trimester OR, 5.1; 95%CI, 1.9-13.2; second trimester OR, 0.5; 95%CI, 0.2-1.2; and third trimester OR, 0.3; 95%CI, 0.1-1.2). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Eye abnormalitiesmay be the only initial finding in congenital Zika virus infection. All infants with potential maternal Zika virus exposure at any time during pregnancy should undergo screening eye examinations regardless of the presence or absence of central nervous system abnormalities.

N2  - Background. Detection of antiretroviral (ARV) resistance in HIV-infected individuals is not uncommon and may be particularly problematic in HIV-infected pregnant women as it can lead to infant infection with resistant strains. To better evaluate the efect of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) on HIV mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), we determined the prevalence of DRMs in a subset of mother-infant pairs enrolled in a multi-center trial of infant prophylaxis among women not receiving ARVs during the current pregnancy. Methods. A case-control design of 1:4 (1 transmitter to 4 nontransmitters) was utilized to evaluate ARV resistance as a predictor of HIV MTCT in specimens obtained from mother-infant pairs. Secondary objectives included identification of potential risk factors associated with the presence of DRMs. Viroseq HIV-1 Genotyping System was performed on mother-infant specimens to assess for mutations that might result in a substantial reduction in drug susceptibility and clinical outcome, as determined by the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database. Results. One hundred and forty infants were infected. Of these, 123 HIV infected mother-infant pairs and 483 of 560 women who did not transmit HIV had amplifa-ble HIV nucleic acid enabling ARV resistance testing. A wide variety of DRMs were detected (Figure 1). Sixty (10%) of 606 women had clinically relevant DRMs; 12 (2%) had DRMs against more than 1 ARV class. Among 123 HIV-infected infants, 13 (11%) had clinically relevant DRMs with 3 (2%) harboring DRMs against more than 1 ARV class. Of 13 infants with DRMs, 10 (77%) were infected in utero. In univariate and multivariate analyses, DRMs in mothers were not associated with increased risk of HIV MTCT (AOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.38-1.5). Log HIV viral load was the only predictor of MTCT (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.6). The presence of DRMs in mothers who transmitted was strongly associated with the presence of DRMs in infants (P < 0.001). Conclusion. In infected pregnant women without ARV exposure during their current gestation, the presence of pre-existing DRMs with a wide diversity was noted. DRMs do not increase the risk of HIV MTCT. However, if women with DRMs are not virologically suppressed they are likely to transmit resistant mutations even without selective ARV pressure, thus complicating treatment options.

N2  - Low intensity exercise during pregnancy and lactation may create a protective effect against the development of obesity in offspring exposed to overnutrition in early life. To test these hypotheses, pregnant rats were randomly assigned into 2 groups: Sedentary and Exercised, low intensity, on a rodent treadmill at 30% VO2Max /30-minute/session/3x/week throughout pregnancy and the lactation. Male offspring were raised in small litters (SL, 3 pups/dam) and normal litters (NL, 9 pups/dam) as models of early overnutrition and normal feed, respectively. Exercised mothers showed low mesenteric fat pad stores and fasting glucose and improved glucose-insulin tolerance, VO2max during lactation and sympathetic activity. Moreover, the breast milk contained elevated levels of insulin. In addition, SL of sedentary mothers presented metabolic dysfunction and glucose and insulin intolerance and were hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic in adulthood. SL of exercised mothers showed lower fat tissue accretion and improvements in glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, insulinemia and glycemia. The results suggest that maternal exercise during the perinatal period can have a possible reprogramming effect to prevent metabolic dysfunction in adult rat offspring exposed to early overnutrition, which may be associated with the improvement in maternal health caused by exercise.

N2  - We describe the eleventh major outbreak of foodborne Trypanosoma cruzi transmission in urban Venezuela, including evidence for vertical transmission from the index case to her fetus. After confirming fetal death at 24 weeks of gestation, pregnancy interruption was performed. On direct examination of the amniotic fluid, trypomastigotes were detected. T. cruzi specific-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) also proved positive when examining autopsied fetal organs. Finally, microscopic fetal heart examination revealed amastigote nests. Acute orally transmitted Chagas disease can be life threatening or even fatal for pregnant women and unborn fetuses owing to vertical transmission. There is therefore an urgent need to improve national epidemiologic control measures.

N2  - Study question: Women should avoid pregnancy, because of the current Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak, as recommended by public health authorities and government leaders of some countries? Summary answer: ZIKV infection risk deserves special attention; however infection with ZIKV during pregnancy does not lead to increased risks than any other previously known pathogens. What is known already: Zika virus (ZIKV) is predominantly spread via the Aedes species of mosquitos. An outbreak is currently spreading throughout South America, resulting in a large number of cases of microcephaly, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and meningoencephalitis. The World HealthOrganization (WHO) declared the ZIKV epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and the CDC Emergency Operations Center elevated their response to ZIKV to level 1, the highest level of activation, for only the fourth time in the history of the organization. Moreover, public health authorities and government leaders in multiple countries have issued first-ever recommendations for women to simply avoid pregnancy. Study design, size, duration: This study was performed in a universityaffiliated In vitro fertilization center in Brazil, in which the issue concerning the ZIKV infection in pregnant women is an extremely real problem, with drastic consequences for the reproductive population and assisted reproduction centers. Considering the fast spread of ZIKV worldwide, a critical discussion on the risk of microcephaly due to ZIKV infection, and incidence rate (IR) of others harmful pathogens to vulnerable pregnant women and infants was conducted. Participants/materials, setting, methods: Brazil has experienced over 1.5 million cases of ZIKV, and WHO estimates that potentially 4 million people in the Americas may become infected in 2016. The Brazilian health officials warned women to avoid pregnancy until the ZIKV outbreak passes. Governments in Colombia and Ecuador made similar recommendations. Recommendations in El Salvador are even more extreme, and women there have been advised to avoid pregnancy until 2018. This study discusses whether such recommendations are justified. Main results and the role of chance: Pregnant women are exposed to many infectious agents that are potentially harmful. Intrauterine bacterial infection, such as: Chlamydia trachomatis (IR=3.8%); Neisseria gonorrhea (IR=1.9%); and Treponema pallidum (Syphilis, IR=0.15-1.5%), viruses infection, such as: Parvovirus B19 (IR= 1- 5%); Cytomegalovirus (IR=1-3%); Varicella Zoster (chickenpox) (IR=0.02%); Herpes Simplex Virus (IR=2%);; and parasites infection, such as: Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease, IR= 0.5-10%); Toxoplasma gondii (IR=0.4%); and Plasmodium sp (Malaria, IR= 2.9% in endemic regions), may represent major risks for pregnant women and fetus. Investigators studying the 2013-2014 ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia estimated that the risk of microcephaly due to ZIKV infection in the first trimester of pregnancy was 0.95% and recently, the magnitude of the risk of microcephaly in Brazil (IR) is estimated to be approximately 0.88%. However, patients who face infertility and the fact that their ovarian reserve is declining, specially older patients, when receiving adequate orientation, did not postpone their IVF cycles, in Brazil. In fact, in the present assisted reproduction center, despite the recommendation of health authorities and government leaders in 2015, 844 cycles were performed, in which 34.0% of the patients were >38 y-old, while in 2016, 769 cycles were performed and 36.8% of the patients were >38 y-old. Limitations, reasons for caution: This is a literature review and authors opinion. Wider implications of the findings: The ZIKV infection risk is extremely high, especially in endemic regions. However the microcephaly risk due to ZIKV is not higher than the risk of miscarriage and birth defects due to other recognized pathogens. Therefore, it is prudent to take precautions to avoid ZIKV as any other infection during pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of syphilis and HIV infection during pregnancy, the mother to child transmission (MTCT) of syphilis and the incidence of congenital syphilis in incarcerated women in Brazil; to compare these rates to those observed in pregnant women outside of jail; and to verify the maternal factors associated with syphilis infection during pregnancy in free and incarcerated women. Methods We used data from two nationwide studies conducted during the period 2011-2014. The ?Birth in Brazil? study included 23 894 free women cared for in 266 hospitals. The ?Maternal and Infant Health in Prisons? study included 495 incarcerated pregnant women or mothers living with their children, according to a census conducted in 33 female prisons. The same case definitions and data collection methods were used in both studies. We used the Chi square test to compare the characteristics of incarcerated and free women with a significance of 0.05. Results For incarcerated women, the estimated prevalence of syphilis during pregnancy was 8.7% (IC 95% 5.7-13.1) and for HIV infection 3.3% (IC 95% 1.7-6.6), rates almost 7 times greater than that found in free women. The estimated MTCT of syphilis was 66.7% (IC 95% 44.7-83.2) and the incidence of congenital syphilis at birth was 58.1 per 1000 living newborns (IC 95% 40.4-82.8), rates two and 12.6 times higher than in free women, respectively. Incarcerated women showed greater social vulnerability and worse results in all the evaluated antenatal indicators. Syphilis infection was associated with social vulnerability in free women, but not in incarcerated women. Conclusion Incarcerated women had a higher prevalence of syphilis and HIV infection during pregnancy, lower quality of antenatal care and higher levels of social vulnerability. Health initiatives in the prison system are necessary to reduce healthcare inequalities and should include adequate antenatal and birth care with opportune diagnosis and treatment of infected pregnant women as recommended in national and international guidelines.

N2  - The isolation of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nmAbs) against the Zika virus (ZIKV) might lead to novel preventative strategies for infections in at-risk individuals, primarily pregnant women. Here we describe the characterization of human mAbs from the plasmablasts of an acutely infected patient. One of the 18 mAbs had the unusual feature of binding to and neutralizing ZIKV despite not appearing to have been diversified by affinity maturation. This mAb neutralized ZIKV (Neut50~ 2 μg/ml) but did not react with any of the four dengue virus serotypes. Except for the expected junctional diversity created by the joining of the V-(D)-J genes, there was no deviation from immunoglobulin germline genes. This is a rare example of a human mAb with neutralizing activity in the absence of detectable somatic hypermutation. Importantly, binding of this mAb to ZIKV was specifically inhibited by human plasma from ZIKV-exposed individuals, suggesting that it may be of value in a diagnostic setting.

N2  - Background: Low n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) has been linked to depression, but the preventive effect of n-3PUFAs supplementation on maternal depression needs further investigation. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a daily dose of n-3 PUFAs supplementation (fish oil) on the prevention of postpartum depression (PPD). Methods: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial was designed and nested into a cohort study conducted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Sixty pregnant women identified as being at risk for PPD were invited and randomly assigned to receive fish oil capsules [1.8 g (1.08 g of Eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and 0.72 g of Docosapentaenoic (DHA) acids)] or placebo (control). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was scored at 5-13 (T0, baseline), 22-24 (T1), 30-32 weeks of gestation (T2) and 4-6 weeks' postpartum (T3). Supplementation started at week 22-24 of gestation (T1) and lasted for 16 weeks. Serum fatty acids were assayed to evaluate compliance. Prevalence of EPDS ≥11 was the primary outcome, and mean and changes in EPDS score, length of gestation, and birth weight the secondary outcomes. Linear mixed-effect (LME) and random-intercept logistic regression models were performed to test the effect of fish oil supplementation on prevalence of EPDS ≥11 and EPDS scores variation. Results: In intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, at 30-32 weeks' gestation women in the fish oil presented higher serum concentration of EPA, DHA and lower n-6/n-3 ratio comparing to the control group. There were no differences between intervention and control groups in the prevalence of EPDS ≥11, EPDS scores over time, or in changes in EPDS scores from pregnancy to postpartum in either the ITT or per-protocol analyses. Women in the fish oil group with previous history of depression presented a higher reduction on the EPDS score from the second to the third trimester in the fish oil comparing to the control group in the ITT analyses [-1.0 (-3.0-0.0) vs. -0.0 (-1.0-3.0), P = 0.038). These results were confirmed on the LME model (β = -3.441; 95%CI: -6.532- -0.350, P = 0.029). Conclusion: Daily supplementation of 1.8 g of n-3 PUFAs during 16 weeks did not prevent maternal depressive symptoms in a sample of Brazilian women. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01660165. Retrospectively registered on 24 May 2012.

N2  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women can cause a wide range of congenital abnormalities, including microcephaly, in the infant, a condition now collectively known as congenital ZIKV syndrome. A vaccine to prevent or significantly attenuate viremia in pregnant women who are residents of or travelers to epidemic or endemic regions is needed to avert congenital ZIKV syndrome, and might also help to suppress epidemic transmission. Here we report on a live-attenuated vaccine candidate that contains a 10-nucleotide deletion in the 3′ untranslated region of the ZIKV genome (10-del ZIKV). The 10-del ZIKV is highly attenuated, immunogenic, and protective in type 1 interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice. Crucially, a single dose of 10-del ZIKV induced sterilizing immunity with a saturated neutralizing antibody titer, which no longer increased after challenge with an epidemic ZIKV, and completely prevented viremia. The immunized mice also developed a robust T cell response. Intracranial inoculation of 1-d-old immunocompetent CD-1 mice with 1 × 104 infectious focus units (IFU) of 10-del ZIKV caused no mortality, whereas infections with 10 IFU of wild-type ZIKV were lethal. Mechanistically, the attenuated virulence of 10-del ZIKV may be due to decreased viral RNA synthesis and increased sensitivity to type-1-interferon inhibition. The attenuated 10-del ZIKV was incapable of infecting mosquitoes after oral feeding of spiked-blood meals, representing an additional safety feature. Collectively, the safety and efficacy results suggest that further development of this promising, live-attenuated ZIKV vaccine candidate is warranted.

N2  - Background Zika is a new disease in the American continent and its surveillance is of utmost importance, especially because of its ability to cause neurological manifestations as Guillain-Barré syndrome and serious congenital malformations through vertical transmission. The detection of suspected cases by the surveillance system depends on the case definition adopted. As the laboratory diagnosis of Zika infection still relies on the use of expensive and complex molecular techniques with low sensitivity due to a narrow window of detection, most suspected cases are not confirmed by laboratory tests, mainly reserved for pregnant women and newborns. In this context, an accurate definition of a suspected Zika case is crucial in order for the surveillance system to gauge the magnitude of an epidemic. Methodology We evaluated the accuracy of various Zika case definitions in a scenario where Dengue and Chikungunya viruses co-circulate. Signs and symptoms that best discriminated PCR confirmed Zika from other laboratory confirmed febrile or exanthematic diseases were identified to propose and test predictive models for Zika infection based on these clinical features. Results and discussion Our derived score prediction model had the best performance because it demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity, 866% and 783%, respectively. This Zika case definition also had the highest values for auROC (0903) and R2 (0417), and the lowest Brier score 0096. Conclusions In areas where multiple arboviruses circulate, the presence of rash with pruritus or conjunctival hyperemia, without any other general clinical manifestations such as fever, petechia or anorexia is the best Zika case definition.

N2  - Objective: There are limited data regarding Xpert performance to detect Group B Streptococcus (GBS) in HIV-infected pregnant women. We evaluated the accuracy of a rapid real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test in a cohort of HIV-infected women. Methods: At 35–37 weeks of pregnancy, a pair of combined rectovaginal swabs were collected for two GBS assays in a cohort of sequentially included HIV-infected women in Rio de Janeiro: (1) culture; and (2) real-time PCR assay [GeneXpert GBS (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA)]. Using culture as the reference, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative-likelihood ratios were estimated. Results: From June 2012 to February 2015, 337 pregnant women met inclusion criteria. One woman was later excluded, due to failure to obtain a result in the index test; 336 were included in the analyses. The GBS colonization rate was 19.04%. Sensitivity and specificity of the GeneXpert GBS assay were 85.94% (95% CI: 75.38–92.42) and 94.85% (95% CI: 91.55–96.91), respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 79.71% (95% CI: 68.78–87.51) and 96.63% (95% CI: 93.72–98.22), respectively. Conclusions: GeneXpert GBS is an acceptable test for the identification of GBS colonization in HIV-infected pregnant women and represents a reasonable option to detect GBS colonization in settings where culture is not feasible.

N2  - Objective To evaluate the associations between first trimester 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status and changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) concentrations, TG/HDL-c, and TC/HDL-c ratios throughout pregnancy. We hypothesized that first trimester 25(OH)D inadequacy is associated with lower concentrations of HDL-c and higher LDL-c, TC, TG, TG/HDL-c, and TC/HDL-c ratios throughout pregnancy. Methods A prospective cohort study with 3 visits at 5–13 (baseline), 20–26, and 30–36 gestational weeks, recruited 194 pregnant women attending a public health care center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Plasma 25(OH)D concentrations were measured in the first trimester using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. 25(OH)D concentrations were classified as adequate (≥ 75 nmol/L) or inadequate (< 75 nmol/L). Serum TC, HDL-c, and TG concentrations were measured enzymatically. Crude and adjusted longitudinal linear mixed-effects models were employed to evaluate the association between the first trimester 25(OH)D status and changes in serum lipid concentrations throughout pregnancy. Confounders adjusted for in the multiple analysis were age, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA), early pregnancy BMI, leisure time physical activity before pregnancy, energy intake, and gestational age. Results At baseline, 69% of the women had inadequate concentrations of 25(OH)D. Women with 25(OH)D inadequacy had higher mean LDL-c than those with adequate concentrations (91.3 vs. 97.5 mg/dL; P = 0.064) at baseline. TC, HDL-c, LDL-c TG, TG/HDL-c ratios, and TC/HDL-c ratios, increased throughout pregnancy independently of 25(OH)D concentrations (ANOVA for repeated measures P < 0.001). The adjusted models showed direct associations between the first trimester 25(OH)D status and changes in TC (β = 9.53; 95%CI = 1.12–17.94), LDL-c (β = 9.99; 95% CI = 3.62–16.36) concentrations, and TC/HDL-c ratios (β = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.01–0.31) throughout pregnancy. Conclusions Inadequate plasma 25(OH)D concentrations during early pregnancy were associated with more pronounced changes of TC, LDL-c concentrations, and TC/HDL-c ratios throughout pregnancy. Changes in these cardiovascular markers suggest the importance of ensuring adequate vitamin D status at the beginning of pregnancy.

N2  - Background/Aims: Viral infection during pregnancy is known to affect the fetal brain. The toll-like receptor (TLR)-3 is a pattern recognition receptor activated by viruses known to elicit adverse fetal neurological outcomes. The P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux transporter protects the developing fetus by limiting the transfer of substrates across both the placenta and the fetal blood-brain barrier (BBB). As such, inhibition of P-gp at these blood-barrier sites may result in increased exposure of the developing fetus to environmental toxins and xenobiotics present in the maternal circulation. We hypothesized that viral exposure during pregnancy would impair P-gp function in the placenta and in the developing BBB. Here we investigated whether the TLR-3 ligand, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C), increased accumulation of one P-gp substrate in the fetus and in the developing fetal brain. Methods: Pregnant C57BL/6 mice (GD15.5) were injected (i.p.) with PolyI:C (5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline). [3H]digoxin (P-gp substrate) was injected (i.v.) 3 or 23h post-treatment and animals were euthanized 1h later. Maternal plasma, 'fetal-units' (fetal membranes, amniotic fluid and whole fetus), and fetal brains were collected. Results: PolyI:C exposure (4h) significantly elevated maternal plasma IL-6 (P<0.001) and increased [3H]digoxin accumulation in the fetal brain (P<0.05). In contrast, 24h after PolyI:C exposure, no effect on IL-6 or fetal brain accumulation of P-gp substrate was observed. Conclusion: Viral infection modeled by PolyI:C causes acute increases in fetal brain accumulation of P-gp substrates and by doing so, may increase fetal brain exposure to xenobiotics and environmental toxins present in the maternal circulation.

N2  - Backgrounds. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been hypothesised to be protective for depression during pregnancy. However, there are few data and no consensus regarding this association. In this line, we aim to evaluate if the concentration of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs, and their ratio, are associated with depressive symptoms throughout pregnancy. Method. A prospective cohort of 172 Brazilian women was followed at 5-13th, 20-26th and 30-36th weeks of gestation. The presence of depressive symptoms was evaluated using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at each pregnancy trimester. Depression was defined as an EPDS score ≥11. The concentrations of n-3 [α-linolenic acid; eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA); docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] and n-6 PUFAs [linoleic acid; γ linolenic acid; eicosadienoic acid; eicosatrienoic acid; arachidonic acid; docosatetraenoic acid and docosapentaenoic acid] were expressed as absolute (μg/ml) values. The total n-6/n-3 ratio was calculated. Statistical analyses were performed using univariate and adjusted random intercept logistic model for each fatty acid (FA) considering the longitudinal nature of data. Covariates were selected as potential confounders based on their biological plausibility of having an association with the concentration of FA and depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Results. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was high in all pregnancy trimesters (1st = 33.7%; 2nd = 18.9%; 3rd = 17.4%). We did not find differences in means FA concentrations by depressive symptom classification, for each follow-up visit. The women presented a 5% decrease in the odds of having depressive symptoms for each one-week increase in the gestational age. As individual women progressed through pregnancy, higher concentrations of EPA (odds ratio (OR) = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86-0.99), DHA (OR = 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93-0.99), DPA (OR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.77-0.99) and total n-3 (OR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96-0.99) were associated with a lower odds of depressive symptoms, while higher total n-6/n-3 ratio were associated with greater odds of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.40; 95% CI: 1.09-1.79). We detected a decrease in the probability of depressive symptoms as concentrations of total n-3 FA, α-linolenic acid, DPA, and DHA increased. We also observed a sharper decline for women with initial greater chance of depressive symptoms compared with those with lower chance of having these symptoms. Conclusions. We found a high prevalence of depressive symptoms in low-income Brazilian pregnant women and no significant associations between n-6 FA and depressive symptoms. Lower serum concentrations of DHA, EPA and DPA and a higher n-6/n-3 ratio at each pregnancy trimester were associated with higher odds of depressive symptoms throughout pregnancy.

N2  - Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are widely used in agriculture. Recently, several animal and epidemiological studies have been conducted to understand the effects of these chemicals as an endocrine disruptor for the gonadal system. The aim of the present study was to determine whether GBHs could also disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. Female pregnant Wistar rats were exposed to a solution containing GBH Roundup®Transorb (Monsanto). The animals were divided into three groups (control, 5 mg/kg/day or 50 mg/kg/day) and exposed from gestation day 18 (GD18) to post-natal day 5 (PND5). Male offspring were euthanized at PND 90, and blood and tissues samples from the hypothalamus, pituitary, liver and heart were collected for hormonal evaluation (TSH—Thyroid stimulating hormone, T3—triiodothyronine and T4—thyroxine), metabolomic and mRNA analyses of genes related to thyroid hormone metabolism and function. The hormonal profiles showed decreased concentrations of TSH in the exposed groups, with no variation in the levels of the thyroid hormones (THs) T3 and T4 between the groups. Hypothalamus gene expression analysis of the exposed groups revealed a reduction in the expression of genes encoding deiodinases 2 (Dio2) and 3 (Dio3) and TH transporters Slco1c1 (former Oatp1c1) and Slc16a2 (former Mct8). In the pituitary, Dio2, thyroid hormone receptor genes (Thra1 and Thrb1), and Slc16a2 showed higher expression levels in the exposed groups than in the control group. Interestingly, Tshb gene expression did not show any difference in expression profile between the control and exposed groups. Liver Thra1 and Thrb1 showed increased mRNA expression in both GBH-exposed groups, and in the heart, Dio2, Mb, Myh6 (former Mhca) and Slc2a4 (former Glut4) showed higher mRNA expression in the exposed groups. Additionally, correlation analysis between gene expression and metabolomic data showed similar alterations as detected in hypothyroid rats. Perinatal exposure to GBH in male rats modified the HPT set point, with lower levels of TSH likely reflecting post-translational events. Several genes regulated by TH or involved in TH metabolism and transport presented varying degrees of gene expression alteration that were probably programmed during intrauterine exposure to GBHs and reflects in peripheral metabolism. In conclusion, the role of GBH exposure in HPT axis disruption should be considered in populations exposed to this herbicide.

N2  - Retention in early HIV care has been associated with decreased mortality and improved viral suppression, however the consequences of poor retention in early care in Brazil remain unknown. We assessed the effect of poor retention on mortality in a Brazilian HIV-infected clinical cohort. The analysis included ART-naïve, HIV-infected adults linked to care at the Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz between 2000 and 2010, who did not become pregnant nor participate in a clinical trial during the first two years in care (early care). Poor retention in early care was defined as less than 3 out of 4 six-month intervals with a CD4 or HIV-1 RNA laboratory result during early care. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with mortality, and Kaplan–Meier plots were used to describe the survival probability for participants with poor retention versus good retention. Among 1054 participants with a median (interquartile range) follow-up time of 4.2 years (2.6, 6.3), 20% had poor retention in early care and 8% died. Poor retention in early care [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 3.09; 95% CI 1.65–5.79], AIDS defining illness (aHR 1.95; 95% CI 1.20–3.18) and lower education (aHR 2.33; 95% CI 1.45–3.75) were associated with increased mortality risk. Our findings highlight the importance of adopting strategies to improve retention in early HIV care.

N2  - A histopathological and immunohistochemical study was conducted in placental tissues and retained products of conception from 24 patients with confirmed dengue infection during pregnancy. The immunohistochemical assay was positive for dengue virus in 19 placental and three ovular remnants analyzed. The light microscopic findings were signs of hypoxia, choriodeciduitis, deciduitis and intervillositis and the viral antigens were found in cytoplasmic of the trophoblast, villous stroma and decidua. Our results suggest that immunohistochemistry could be used as a laboratory confirmation method for dengue in pregnant women, especially in endemic areas when embedded material is the only material available.

N2  - Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging Flavivirus, was recently associated with severe neurological complications and congenital diseases. Therefore, development of antiviral agents capable of inhibiting ZIKV replication is urgent. Chloroquine is a molecule with a confirmed safety history for use with pregnant women, and has been found to exhibit anti-ZIKV activity at concentrations around 10 μM. This suggests that modifications to the chloroquine structure could be promising for obtaining more effective anti-ZIKV agents. Here, we report the ability of a series of N-(2-(arylmethylimino)ethyl)-7-chloroquinolin-4-amine derivatives to inhibit ZIKV replication in vitro. We have found that the quinoline derivative, N-(2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylimino)ethyl)-7-chloroquinolin-4-amine, 40, was the most potent compound within this series, reducing ZIKV replication by 72% at 10 μM. Compound 40 exhibits an EC50value of 0.8 ± 0.07 μM, compared to that of chloroquine of 12 ± 3.2 μM. Good activities were also obtained for other compounds, including those with aryl groups = phenyl, 4-fluorophenyl, 4-nitrophenyl, 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl, 3-pyridinyl and 5-nitrothien-2-yl. Syntheses of these quinoline derivatives have been obtained both by thermal and ultrasonic means. The ultrasonic method produced comparable yields to the thermal (reflux) method in very much shorter times 30–180 s compared to 30–180 min reactions times. These results indicate that this group of compounds is a good follow-up point for the potential discovery of new drugs against the Zika disease.

N2  - Objective: Assess the perinatal outcomes and identify what maternal characteristics can influence them in women who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Materials and Methods: Analytical, prospective, and longitudinal study with pregnant adult women. Inclusion criteria: chronological age >20 years; singleton pregnancy; RYGB surgery before pregnancy. Exclusion criteria: prior malabsorptive or restrictive surgeries; malabsorption syndrome. Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistics software, version 17. Results: Thirty pregnant women with 30.22 ± 4.38 years, the interval between surgery and the date of last menstrual period was 17.7 ± 9.07 months. The average prepregnancy body mass index was characterized as overweight (27.36 ± 3.26 kg/m2), total gestational weight gain was 7.68 ± 3.73 kg. The most common pregnancy complications were anemia (73.3%), urinary tract infection (33.4%), and dumping syndrome (33.4%). As for newborns, 58% were male, with a mean of 39.28 ± 0.84 weeks, 90% were classified as appropriate for gestational age, and 93.4% were born at term with adequate weight (39.28 ± 0.84 weeks and 3128.79 ± 271.49 g). Positive and significant correlation was observed between gestational weekly gain in the first trimester and birth weight (r = 0.42, p = 0.024) and between gestational weekly gain in the second trimester and birth weight (r = 0.48, p = 0.008). Conclusions: Despite the completion of RYGB, in general, there was no apparent fetal compromise when considering the analysis of the variables proposed by this study.

N2  - Compared with other flaviviruses, Zika virus (ZIKV) is uniquely associated with congenital diseases in pregnant women. One recent study reported that (i) ZIKV has higher thermostability than dengue virus (DENV [a flavivirus closely related to ZIKV]), which might contribute to the disease outcome; (ii) the higher thermostability of ZIKV could arise from an extended loop structure in domain III of the viral envelope (E) protein and an extra hydrogen-bond interaction between E molecules (V. A. Kostyuchenko, E. X. Y. Lim, S. Zhang, G. Fibriansah, T.-S. Ng, J. S. G. Ooi, J. Shi, and S.-M. Lok, Nature 533:425–428, 2016, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature17994). Here we report the functional analysis of the structural information in the context of complete ZIKV and DENV-2 virions. Swapping the prM-E genes between ZIKV and DENV-2 switched the thermostability of the chimeric viruses, identifying the prM-E proteins as the major determinants for virion thermostability. Shortening the extended loop of the E protein by 1 amino acid was lethal for ZIKV assembly/release. Mutations (Q350I and T351V) that abolished the extra hydrogen-bond interaction between the E proteins did not reduce ZIKV thermostability, indicating that the extra interaction does not increase the thermostability. Interestingly, mutant T351V was attenuated in A129 mice defective in type I interferon receptors, even though the virus retained the wild-type thermostability. Furthermore, we found that a chimeric ZIKV with the DENV-2 prM-E and a chimeric DENV-2 with the ZIKV prM-E were highly attenuated in A129 mice; these chimeric viruses were highly immunogenic and protective against DENV-2 and ZIKV challenge, respectively. These results indicate the potential of these chimeric viruses for vaccine development.IMPORTANCE Analysis of a recently observed high-resolution structure of ZIKV led to a hypothesis that its unusual stability may contribute to the associated, unique disease outcomes. Here we performed a functional analysis to demonstrate that viral prM-E genes are the main determinants for the high stability of ZIKV. The extra hydrogen-bond interaction (observed in the high-resolution structure) between ZIKV E proteins did not enhance virion stability, whereas the extended loop of E protein (CD loop in domain III) was essential for ZIKV assembly. More importantly, we found that a chimeric ZIKV with DENV-2 prM-E genes and a chimeric DENV-2 with ZIKV prM-E genes were highly attenuated in A129 mice. Mice immunized with these chimeric viruses generated robust neutralizing antibody responses and were fully protected from DENV-2 and ZIKV challenge, respectively, indicating that these chimeric viruses could be further developed as vaccine candidates.

N2  - Background Zika virus (ZIKV) was first identified in the Americas in 2015, when an outbreak of an exanthematous illness occurred in Brazil. Subsequentely, there was an increase of microcephaly cases, suggesting an association between ZIKV and this neurological complication. Currently, ZIKV has been recognised as causing a wide range of neurological complications including Guillain Barré syndrome, and myelitis. Objectives In this report, we describe the first fatal case of encephalitis in a 47 years old non pregnant woman, infected during the Brazilian zika epidemic of 2016. Study design The diagnosis of encephalitis was determined by the presence of a disturbed level of consciousness and focal neurological signs during an exanthemous viral infection. Results CSF analysis supported the diagnosis of viral encephalitis, revealing lymphocytic pleocytosis, a high protein concentration, and the presence of IgM zika antibodies. RT-PCR analysis for ZIKV was positive in the urine. A brain computed tomography showed massive brain swelling. Our case differs from previous reports, because her neurological picture developed rapidly and in a very aggressive manner leading to brain death after eleven days of admission. Conclusion In endemic areas, ZIKV should be considered as an aetiological agent in cases of encephalitis, and clinicians should be aware of its potential severity.

N2  - Introduction: Pregnancy is characterized by a high prevalence of mental disorders. Depression is the most common of these disorders and it is a risk factor for negative maternal and child development outcomes. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are conventional and well-established therapeutic options, but some clients fail to respond and the safety of using some pharmacological agents during pregnancy is unclear. Some neuromodulation techniques, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), have been studied in depressed pregnant women. Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of rTMS for major depression in pregnant women. Methods: The LILACS and PubMed databases were reviewed using the search terms depression, pregnancy and magnetic stimulation. Texts including primary data, published in Portuguese, Spanish, or English, between 1995 and 2014, that evaluated depressed pregnant women and used rTMS as the intervention were selected. Papers lacking sufficient data were excluded. Twenty-two texts were initially identified; after applying the inclusion criteria, 12 were selected and analyzed. Results: The studies reviewed reported satisfactory responses to rTMS in acute depressive episodes, as measured using depressive symptom scales. Remission of symptoms was achieved in many cases. The procedure was well tolerated and there were no reports of damage/complications to unborn children. Conclusion: The data available at this time support the efficacy and tolerability of rTMS for depression in pregnant women. Controlled studies should corroborate this conclusion. This review only included studies in three languages and the resulting sample size was not large enough to conduct a meta-analysis.

N2  - Background The incidence of microcephaly in Brazil in 2015 was 20 times higher than in previous years. Congenital microcephaly is associated with genetic factors and several causative agents. Epidemiological data suggest that microcephaly cases in Brazil might be associated with the introduction of Zika virus. We aimed to detect and sequence the Zika virus genome in amniotic fluid samples of two pregnant women in Brazil whose fetuses were diagnosed with microcephaly. Methods In this case study, amniotic fluid samples from two pregnant women from the state of Paraíba in Brazil whose fetuses had been diagnosed with microcephaly were obtained, on the recommendation of the Brazilian health authorities, by ultrasound-guided transabdominal amniocentesis at 28 weeks' gestation. The women had presented at 18 weeks' and 10 weeks' gestation, respectively, with clinical manifestations that could have been symptoms of Zika virus infection, including fever, myalgia, and rash. After the amniotic fluid samples were centrifuged, DNA and RNA were extracted from the purified virus particles before the viral genome was identified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic reconstruction and investigation of recombination events were done by comparing the Brazilian Zika virus genome with sequences from other Zika strains and from flaviviruses that occur in similar regions in Brazil. Findings We detected the Zika virus genome in the amniotic fluid of both pregnant women. The virus was not detected in their urine or serum. Tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, HIV, Treponema pallidum, and parvovirus B19 were all negative. After sequencing of the complete genome of the Brazilian Zika virus isolated from patient 1, phylogenetic analyses showed that the virus shares 97–100% of its genomic identity with lineages isolated during an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013, and that in both envelope and NS5 genomic regions, it clustered with sequences from North and South America, southeast Asia, and the Pacific. After assessing the possibility of recombination events between the Zika virus and other flaviviruses, we ruled out the hypothesis that the Brazilian Zika virus genome is a recombinant strain with other mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Interpretation These findings strengthen the putative association between Zika virus and cases of microcephaly in neonates in Brazil. Moreover, our results suggest that the virus can cross the placental barrier. As a result, Zika virus should be considered as a potential infectious agent for human fetuses. Pathogenesis studies that confirm the tropism of Zika virus for neuronal cells are warranted.

N2  - This study evaluated the risk to human health from mercury (Hg) exposure through fish consumption in the Pantanal, Brazil. In order to address these risks, Hg concentrations and accumulation patterns were determined in target organs of predatory fish (Crenicichla lepidota and Pygocentrus nattereri). Levels of Hg were analysed during the two phases of the flood pulse (flood and drought) in fish from different local ecosystems, such as the Bento Gomes and Paraguay rivers. Although the former study area is directly affected by gold mining, a higher, but not significantly different, Hg concentration in fish was found compared with fish at the Paraguay River, which is regarded as pristine area. Moreover, no seasonal variability was found in either river. Although total mercury levels in fish did not exceed the maximum FAO/WHO threshold (0.5 μg g(-1)), according to dietary habits in riverine communities of the Pantanal (up to 6 oz of fish per day), there is reason for concern over the potential for deleterious health effects that could be caused by high Hg intake. In fact, the estimated daily intake in the present study ranged from 0.49 to 1.08 μg Hg kg(-1) day(-1), for adults (including women of childbearing age) and children, respectively. Because of high Hg intakes in riverine groups, which exceed the recommended reference dose value, these communities could be considered at risk. Therefore, it is necessary to consider regulatory measures and public education regarding fish consumption, particularly in vulnerable groups (i.e. children, pregnant women and women of childbearing age).

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Prenatal diagnosis and management of Trypanosoma cruzi infection can significantly reduce its associated morbidity and mortality and contribute to the eradication of Chagas' disease. The objective of this study is to explore the seroprevalence of this parasite among pregnant women attending antenatal care in public health facilities in Maceió, Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with pregnant women attending primary care units for antenatal care between June 2007 and May 2012. Analyses of medical records and mandatory notification data were performed for serologically confirmed patients with T. cruzi infection and their offspring. Measures of central tendency and dispersion were calculated and analysis of variance was used to identify the discrepancy between obstetric variables and serologic results. RESULTS: A total of 54,813 pregnant women participated and the prevalence Chagas' disease was 0.12%. Compared with noninfected patients (mean [SD] age: 28.8 [6.14] years), the infected group (30.2 [7.6] years) had a higher incidence of spontaneous abortion (52% versus 34% of pregnant women; P=.0185). The chagasic patients' mean gestational age at first antenatal visit was 17.1±7.6 weeks. Four (5.9%) of them had syphilis; however, no other co-infection was reported. Only 42.6% (29) of the infants from the infected mothers underwent diagnostic examinations, all of them with negative results. CONCLUSION: Chagas' disease is associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes. Vertical transmission may occur in any part of the world, resulting from increasing population mobility; hence well-established surveillance programs are warranted -which involves testing pregnant women at risk of infection and all children born to seropositive mothers.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Sociodemographic factors may affect adherence to specific dietary patterns during pregnancy. The present study aimed to identify dietary patterns during pregnancy and associated factors among Brazilian pregnant women.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional analysis. Dietary intake was evaluated with a semi-quantitative FFQ during the first postpartum week; the time frame included the second and third gestational trimesters. Principal component analysis was used to identify dietary patterns during pregnancy. Sociodemographic data were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Multiple linear regressions were applied to test the associations between the sociodemographic factors and dietary patterns.
SETTING: Mesquita, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2011.
SUBJECTS: Postpartum women (n 327) who were 18-45 years of age and Mesquita residents.
RESULTS: Three different dietary patterns were identified: 'healthy' (mainly comprising legumes, vegetables and fruits), 'mixed' (mainly comprising candy, butter and margarine, and snacks) and 'traditional' (mainly comprising beans and rice). Women with a higher monthly per capita family income (β=0·0006; 95% CI 0·0001, 0·001; P=0·011) and women of older age (β=0·021; 95% CI -0·001, 0·042; P=0·058) were more likely to adhere to the 'healthy' dietary pattern. Women with higher parity were less likely to adhere to the 'healthy' pattern (β=-0·097; 95% CI -0·184, -0·009; P=0·030) and were more likely to adhere to the 'traditional' pattern (β=0·098; 95% CI 0·021, 0·175; P=0·012). Although not statistically significant, older women were less likely to adhere to the 'mixed' (β=-0·017; 95% CI -0·037, 0·003; P=0·075) and 'traditional' (β=-0·018; 95% CI -0·037, 0·001; P=0·061) dietary patterns.
CONCLUSIONS: Monthly per capita family income, parity and maternal age were factors associated with adherence to a healthy diet during pregnancy.

N2  - Introduction Congenital infection caused by Toxoplasma gondii can cause serious damage that can be diagnosed in utero or at birth, although most infants are asymptomatic at birth. Prenatal diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis considerably improves the prognosis and outcome for infected infants. For this reason, an assay for the quick, sensitive, and safe diagnosis of fetal toxoplasmosis is desirable. Goal To systematically review the performance of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the amniotic fluid of pregnant women with recent serological toxoplasmosis diagnoses for the diagnosis of fetal toxoplasmosis. Method A systematic literature review was conducted via a search of electronic databases; the literature included primary studies of the diagnostic accuracy of PCR analysis of amniotic fluid from pregnant women who seroconverted during pregnancy. The PCR test was compared to a gold standard for diagnosis. Results A total of 1.269 summaries were obtained from the electronic database and reviewed, and 20 studies, comprising 4.171 samples, met the established inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The following results were obtained: studies about PCR assays for fetal toxoplasmosis are generally susceptible to bias; reports of the tests' use lack critical information; the protocols varied among studies; the heterogeneity among studies was concentrated in the tests' sensitivity; there was evidence that the sensitivity of the tests increases with time, as represented by the trimester; and there was more heterogeneity among studies in which there was more time between maternal diagnosis and fetal testing. The sensitivity of the method, if performed up to five weeks after maternal diagnosis, was 87% and specificity was 99%. Conclusion The global sensitivity heterogeneity of the PCR test in this review was 66.5%(I2). The tests show low evidence of heterogeneity with a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 99% when performed up to five weeks after maternal diagnosis. The test has a known performance and could be recommended for use up to five weeks after maternal diagnosis, when there is suspicion of fetal toxoplasmosis.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence and determinants of gestational night blindness in pregnant women receiving care in a hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of pregnant and postpartum women receiving care in a public hospital in Rio de Janeiro from 1999 to 2001 (group I; n 225) or from 2005 to 2008 (group II; n 381). Night blindness was identified through a standardized and validated interview (WHO, 1996). The determinants of gestational night blindness were identified through a hierarchical logistic regression model.
SETTING: Public maternity hospital in Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.
SUBJECTS: Adult pregnant and postpartum women (n 606), aged ≥20 years.
RESULTS: The prevalence of gestational night blindness was 9·9 %. The final model revealed that not living in the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro (distal level: adjusted OR=1·846; 95 % CI 1·002, 3·401), belonging to group I (intermediate level: adjusted OR=2·183; 95 % CI 1·066, 4·471) and for the proximal level, having a history of abortion (adjusted OR=2·840; 95 % CI 1·134, 7·115) and having anaemia during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy (adjusted OR=3·776; 95 % CI 1·579, 9·029) were determinants of gestational night blindness.
CONCLUSION: Gestational night blindness should be assessed for during the prenatal care of all pregnant women, especially those living in deprived areas of the city and/or who have a history of abortion or anaemia. Nutritional monitoring is recommended during pregnancy to control gestational night blindness.

N2  - Purpose: The objective of this study was to evaluate vitamin D nutritional status and its relation with ionic calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), maternal anthropometry and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women who previously underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. Methods: In a clinic specialized in obesity control located in the city of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), the following information were collected for adult women who underwent RYGB before pregnancy: serum concentrations of vitamin D [25(OH)D], calcium and PTH per gestational trimester and data on maternal anthropometry, gestational intercurrences and perinatal outcomes. Results: The present study included 46 post-RYGB pregnant women. The prevalence of pregnant women with deficiency (≤20 ng/mL) or insufficiency (≥21 and 29 ng/mL) of vitamin D was above 70 % in all trimesters. The prevalence of calcium deficiency was 15.2 % in the first and in the second trimesters and 20 % in the third trimester, while the prevalence of excess PTH was 19.6, 30.4 and 32.6 % in the first, the second and the third trimesters, respectively. In the second and the third trimesters, a significant difference was observed between concentrations of 25(OH)D, and a negative correlation was observed between concentrations of calcium and PTH. Association of 25(OH)D with urinary tract infection (UTI) was found, but there was no association with calcium, PTH, maternal anthropometry, type of delivery and weight and gestational age at birth Conclusions: The post-RYGB pregnant women showed an elevated serum inadequacy (deficiency or insufficiency) of 25(OH)D during pregnancy. Maternal vitamin D status showed no association with maternal variables, except UTI, and the neonatal variables analyzed.

N2  - Objective To evaluate the rate of change in serum lipids and the factors associated with their variations, stratifying for pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) categories. Design Prospective cohort. Setting Public Health centre, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Population Two hundred and twenty-five healthy pregnant women recruited between 2009 and 2011. Methods Women were evaluated during the three trimesters of pregnancy (5th-13th, 20th-26th and 30th-36th gestational weeks). Pre-pregnancy BMI (kg/m) was classified as normal weight (NW = 18.5-24.9), overweight (OW = 25.0-29.9) or obese (OB ≥ 30.0). The independent variables included maternal socioeconomic, demographic, biochemical and lifestyle factors. We performed linear mixed-effects models adjusted for gestational age and body weight, reporting coefficient (β) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Main outcome measures Longitudinal total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c) and triglyceride (TG) measurements. Results OW and OB women presented higher mean TG, TC and LDL-c compared with their NW counterparts (P < 0.05). The mean HDL-c concentrations were higher in NW than in OB women (P = 0.03). OW and OB women presented lower serum TC (βOW = -0.014; 95% CI = -0.026 to -0.002; P = 0.022; βOB = -0.015; 95% CI -0.015 to 0.001; P = 0.066) and LDL-c (βOW = -0.012; 95% CI = -0.021 to -0.002; P = 0.017; βOB = -0.018; 95% CI = -0.031 to -0.005; P = 0.005) rates of change (mmol/l per gestational week) compared with the NW. Pre-gestational BMI was the main factor associated with the rate of changes in TC and LDL-c concentrations. Conclusion Pre-pregnancy BMI was the main factor associated with the rate of change in TC and LDL-c throughout pregnancy, and OW and OB women presented lower rates of change compared with NW controls.

N2  - Objective: The objective of the present study is to evaluate the nutritional status of vitamin A through biochemical and functional indicators of pregnant women who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery compared to pregnant women who did not undergo this surgery. Methods: The present study is a cross-sectional study of the analytical type with pregnant women paired by age and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI). Group 1 (G1) comprised 80 pregnant women without previous submission to RYGB and group 2 (G2) by 40 pregnant women who previously underwent this surgery. We used high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detector for quantification of retinol and β-carotene, and the functional evaluation of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) was performed through standardized interview validated for pregnant women. Results: G1 mean age was 29.3 ± 5.3 and 30.8 ± 4.4 in G2. BMI mean prepregnancy found in G1 was 25.7 ± 3.2 and 26.8 ± 3.1 in G2, featuring overweight. Serum retinol and β-carotene means were significantly higher in G1 (1.8 ± 0.9; 87.4 ± 62.2) compared to G2 (0.99 ± 0.39; 22.7 ± 18.0), respectively (p < 0.001). Regarding the functional indicator for evaluation of VAD, approximately 75.0 % of pregnant women in G2 showed night blindness and 20.0 % in G1, and the percentage of pregnant women with this functional impairment was significantly higher in G2 compared to G1 with p < 0.001. Conclusion: Results show that pregnancy after RYGB can represent a high-risk situation for VAD. We recommend interdisciplinary monitoring added to the prenatal routine consultations and the conduction of studies addressed to the investigation of a safe and effective dose of oral supplementation of vitamin A to pregnant women undergoing RYGB.

N2  - BACKGROUND Pregnancy represents a challenge for women with sickle cell disease (SCD), with higher rates of both maternal and fetal complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of prophylactic transfusion support administered specifically to pregnant women with sickle hemoglobin C disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients were divided into two groups according to the type of transfusion support received: 10 women received prophylactic erythrocytapheresis or manual exchange transfusion at 28 weeks of gestation, and 14 received transfusions only on demand, due to acute complications, or received no transfusions at all. RESULTS Our results indicated higher frequencies of SCD-related complications in the group that did not receive prophylactic transfusion support (35.7% vs. only 10% in the erythrocytapheresis group). Furthermore, these complications were more severe in this group and included all cases of acute chest syndrome. A significant difference was observed concerning gestational age at birth (38.7 weeks in the transfusion group vs. 34.4 weeks, p = 0.037), with a higher frequency of preterm births in the nontransfused group (69.23% vs. 30% in the transfusion group). CONCLUSION We demonstrated a clear reduction of unfavorable outcomes in patients receiving prophylactic transfusions, probably reflecting better maternal and fetal conditions, which corroborated to the more satisfactory indices of vitality, observed in newborns. Considering that erythrocytapheresis or manual exchange transfusions both represent feasible and safe procedures, they could represent important tools for the optimal management of these patients.

N2  - Objective To evaluate vitamin A status and its relationship with serum zinc concentrations among pregnant women who had previously undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), correlating these measures with anthropometric maternal characteristics and perinatal outcomes. Methods An analytical prospective longitudinal study was conducted at a clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between March 3, 2008, and March 30, 2012, among women with singleton pregnancies who had previously undergone RYGB. Participants received daily oral supplementation with 5000 IU retinol and 15 mg zinc. Variables assessed included vitamin A status (serum retinol and β-carotene; gestational night blindness), serum zinc concentration, maternal anthropometry, complications during pregnancy, and perinatal outcomes. Results Overall, 30 women participated. In all trimesters, more than 60% had inadequate serum levels of retinol or β-carotene. Night blindness was reported by 17 (57%) women in each trimester. Only 6 (20%) women had zinc inadequacy in the first and third trimesters. No significant association was observed between serum retinol or zinc and maternal anthropometry and birth weight. Vitamin A deficiency was associated with urinary tract infection (first trimester, P = 0.020) and dumping syndrome (third trimester, P = 0.013). Conclusion Despite RYGB and nutritional deficiencies (especially of vitamin A and zinc) increasing risks during pregnancy, there was no apparent fetal compromise when considering the analysis of birth weight and length of pregnancy at birth.

N2  - Lopinavir-ritonavir is frequently prescribed to HIV-1-infected women during pregnancy. Decreased lopinavir exposure has been reported during pregnancy, but the clinical significance of this reduction is uncertain. This analysis aimed to evaluate the need for lopinavir dose adjustment during pregnancy. We conducted a population pharmacokinetic analysis of lopinavir and ritonavir concentrations collected from 84 pregnant and 595 nonpregnant treatment-naive and -experienced HIV-1-infected subjects enrolled in six clinical studies. Lopinavir-ritonavir doses in the studies ranged between 400/100 and 600/150 mg twice daily. In addition, linear mixed-effect analysis was used to compare the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h (AUC0-12) and concentration prior to dosing (Cpredose) in pregnant women and nonpregnant subjects. The relationship between lopinavir exposure and virologic suppression in pregnant women and nonpregnant subjects was evaluated. Population pharmacokinetic analysis estimated 17% higher lopinavir clearance in pregnant women than in nonpregnant subjects. Lopinavir clearance values postpartum were 26.4% and 37.1% lower than in nonpregnant subjects and pregnant women, respectively. As the tablet formulation was estimated to be 20% more bioavailable than the capsule formulation, no statistically significant differences between lopinavir exposure in pregnant women receiving the tablet formulation and nonpregnant subjects receiving the capsule formulation were identified. In the range of lopinavir AUC0-12 or Cpredose values observed in the third trimester, there was no correlation between lopinavir exposure and viral load or proportion of subjects with virologic suppression. Similar efficacy was observed between pregnant women and nonpregnant subjects receiving lopinavir-ritonavir at 400/100 mg twice daily. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results support the use of a lopinavir-ritonavir 400/100-mg twice-daily dose during pregnancy.

N2  - The molecular identification of the Sporothrix schenckii complex has not only changed epidemiology data but has also shown atypical clinical features leading to new therapeutic challenges. S. brasiliensis is the main etiological agent of the biggest feline zoonotic transmission to be reported in southeast Brazil since the late 1990s. Its phenotype has also changed as a result of the production of melanin in primary cultures from patient-affected sites; it is thus thought to be a more virulent species. Elderly, children, pregnant women, and immunosuppressed patients, particularly AIDS patients, are special groups that are at risk. More aggressive diseases have been observed in apparently immunocompetent patients. This article is intended to review the main aspects of clinical and therapeutic approaches that have been learned from the epidemics.

N2  - Introduction: Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent malaria species in the American region. Brazil accounts for the higher number of the malaria cases reported in pregnant women in the Americas. This study aims to describe the characteristics of pregnant women with malaria in an endemic area of the Brazilian Amazon and the risk factors associated with prematurity and low birth weight (LBW). Methods/Principal Findings: Between December 2005 and March 2008, 503 pregnant women with malaria that attended a tertiary health centre were enrolled and followed up until delivery and reported a total of 1016 malaria episodes. More than half of study women (54%) were between 20-29 years old, and almost a third were adolescents. The prevalence of anaemia at enrolment was 59%. Most women (286/503) reported more than one malaria episode and most malaria episodes (84.5%, 846/1001) were due to P. vivax infection. Among women with only P. vivax malaria, the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight decreased in multigravidae (OR, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.16-0.82]; p = 0.015 and OR 0.24 [95% CI, 0.10-0.58]; p = 0.001, respectively). The risk of preterm birth decreased with higher maternal age (OR 0.43 [95% CI, 0.19-0.95]; p = 0.037) and among those women who reported higher antenatal care (ANC) attendance (OR, 0.32 [95% CI, 0.15-0.70]; p = 0.005). Conclusion: This study shows that P. vivax is the prevailing species among pregnant women with malaria in the region and shows that vivax clinical malaria may represent harmful consequences for the health of the mother and their offsprings particularly on specific groups such as adolescents, primigravidae and those women with lower ANC attendance.

N2  - CONCLUSIONS: In general, Brazilians' dietary intake is compatible with a high risk of obesity and non-communicable chronic diseases, being characterized by high intakes of added sugar and saturated fat. Income may be a major determinant of diet nutritional characteristics.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize energy and macronutrient intakes in Brazil and to describe the top food items contributing to energy and macronutrient intakes.
DESIGN: Two non-consecutive 24 h dietary records were collected and energy and macronutrient data were adjusted for usual intake distribution. Descriptive statistics and ANOVA with the Bonferroni post hoc test were analysed using SAS version 9·1. Means and standard deviations were estimated for sex, age and income strata.
SETTING: Nationwide cross-sectional survey, 2008-2009.
SUBJECTS: Nationally representative sample of individuals ≥10 years old (n32 749), excluding pregnant and lactating women (n 1254).
RESULTS: The average energy intake was 7958 kJ/d (1902 kcal/d) and mean energy density was 6·82 kJ/g (1·63 kcal/g). Added sugar represented 13 % of total energy intake and animal protein represented 10 %. The mean contribution of total fat to energy intake was 27 %, while the mean saturated fat contribution was 9 %. Compared with the lowest quartile of income, individuals in the highest income quartile had greater mean intakes of energy, added sugar, alcohol, animal protein, total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat and trans fat. Rice, beans, beef, bread and coffee were among the top five foods contributing most to the intakes of energy, carbohydrates, protein, fat and fibre.

At entry into prenatal care, the mean CD4 cell count for this cohort of patients was 406 cells/mm3 (95% CI: 373–438 cells/mm3), while the mean HIV RNA was 24,394 copies/ml (95% CI: 18,275–30,513 copies/ml). Thirty-six women (16%) had detectable antiretroviral-resistant mutations. By 34 weeks gestation, 75% had achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/ml. Our logistic regression model showed the odds of harbouring antiretroviral-resistant virus with a baseline CD4 cell count of <200 cells/mm3 was eight times that of subjects with CD4 cell counts =500 CD4 cells/mm3 (95% CI 1.5–42.73). Six infants were HIV infected, four born to mothers with detectable viraemia at 34 weeks and two born to mothers who were lost to follow up. Antiretroviral resistance is common in prenatal care but did not increase vertical transmission if viral load was appropriately suppressed. Genotyping should be considered in Brazil in order to assist initiation of appropriate combination antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy to suppress viral load to avoid vertical transmission.

N2  - The primary objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of this disease in women of childbearing age and children treated at health centres in underserviced areas of the city of Buenos Aires. Demographic and Chagas disease status data were collected. Samples for Chagas disease serology were obtained on filter paper and the reactive results were confirmed with conventional samples. A total of 1,786 subjects were screened and 73 positive screening results were obtained: 17 were from children and 56 were from women. The Trypanosoma cruzi infection risk was greater in those individuals who had relatives with Chagas disease, who remember seeing kissing bugs, who were of Bolivian nationality or were born in the Argentine province of Santiago del Estero. The overall prevalence of Chagas disease was 4.08%. Due to migration, Chagas disease is currently predominantly urban. The observed prevalence requires health programme activities that are aimed at urban children and their mothers. Most children were infected congenitally, which reinforces the need for Chagas disease screening of all pregnant women and their babies in Argentina. The active search for new cases is important because the appropriate treatment in children has a high cure rate.

N2  - Tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in women of childbearing age (15-44 years). Despite increased tuberculosis risk during pregnancy, optimal clinical treatment remains unclear: safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data for many tuberculosis drugs are lacking, and trials of promising new tuberculosis drugs exclude pregnant women. To advance inclusion of pregnant and postpartum women in tuberculosis drug trials, the US National Institutes of Health convened an international expert panel. Discussions generated consensus statements (>75% agreement among panelists) identifying high-priority research areas during pregnancy, including: (1) preventing progression of latent tuberculosis infection, especially in women coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus; (2) evaluating new agents/regimens for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; and (3) evaluating safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of tuberculosis drugs already in use during pregnancy and postpartum. Incorporating pregnant women into clinical trials would extend evidence-based tuberculosis prevention and treatment standards to this special population. 2015 The Author 2015.

N2  - Congenital infection with Trypanosoma cruzi is a global problem, occurring on average in 5% of children born from chronically infected mothers in endemic areas, with variations depending on the region. This presentation aims to focus on and update epidemiological data, research methods, involved factors, control strategy and possible prevention of congenital infection with T. cruzi. Considering that etiological treatment of the child is always effective if performed before one year of age, the diagnosis of infection in pregnant women and their newborns has to become the standard of care and integrated into the surveillance programs of syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus. In addition to the standard tests, polymerase chain reaction performed on blood of neonates of infected mothers one month after birth might improve the diagnosis of congenital infection. Recent data bring out that its transmission can be prevented through treatment of infected women before they become pregnant. The role of parasite genotypes and host genetic factors in parasite transmission and development of infection in foetuses/neonates has to be more investigated in order to better estimate the risk factors and impact on health of congenital infection with T. cruzi.

N2  - Background. The Pan-American Health Organization has called for reducing (1) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) to ≤0.30 infections/1000 live births (LB), (2) HIV MTCT risk to ≤2.0%, and (3) congenital syphilis (CS) incidence to ≤0.50/1000 LB in the Americas by 2015. Methods. Using published Brazilian data in amathematical model, we simulated a cohort of pregnant women from antenatal care (ANC) through birth.We investigated 2 scenarios: "current access" (89.1% receive one ANC syphilis test and 41.1% receive 2; 81.7% receive one ANC HIV test and 18.9% receive birth testing; if diagnosed, 81.0% are treated for syphilis and 87.5% are treated for HIV) and "ideal access" (95% of women undergo 2 HIV and syphilis screenings; 95% receive appropriate treatment). We conducted univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses on key inputs. Results. With current access, we projected 2.95 CS cases/1000 LB, 0.29 HIV infections/1000 LB, 7.1% HIV MTCT risk, and 11.11 intrauterine fetal demises (IUFD)/1000 pregnancies, with significant regional variation.With ideal access, we projected improved outcomes: 1.00 CS cases/1000 LB, 0.10 HIV infections/1000 LB, HIV MTCT risk of 2.4%, and 10.65 IUFD/1000 pregnancies. Increased testing drove the greatest improvements. Even with ideal access, only HIV infections/ 1000 LB met elimination goals. Achieving all targets required testing and treatment >95% and reductions in prevalence and incidence of HIV and syphilis. Conclusions. Increasing access to care and HIV and syphilis antenatal testing will substantially reduce HIV and syphilis MTCT in Brazil. In addition, regionally tailored interventions reducing syphilis incidence and prevalence and supporting HIV treatment adherence are necessary to completely meet elimination goals.

N2  - Background: Congenital transmission is a major source of new Trypanosoma cruzi infections, and as vector and blood bank control continue to improve, the proportion due to congenital infection will grow. A major unanswered question is why reported transmission rates from T. cruzi-infected mothers vary so widely among study populations. Women with high parasite loads during pregnancy are more likely to transmit to their infants, but the factors that govern maternal parasite load are largely unknown. Better understanding of these factors could enable prioritization of screening programs to target women most at risk of transmission to their infants. Methodology/Principal Findings: We screened pregnant women presenting for delivery in a large urban hospital in Bolivia and followed infants of infected women for congenital Chagas disease. Of 596 women screened, 128 (21.5%) had confirmed T. cruzi infection; transmission occurred from 15 (11.7%) infected women to their infants. Parasite loads were significantly higher among women who transmitted compared to those who did not. Congenital transmission occurred from 31.3% (9/29), 15.4% (4/26) and 0% (0/62) of women with high, moderate and low parasite load, respectively (χx2 for trend 18.2; p<0.0001). Twin births were associated with higher transmission risk and higher maternal parasite loads. Infected women without reported vector exposure had significantly higher parasite loads than those who had lived in an infested house (median 26.4 vs 0 parasites/mL; p<0.001) with an inverse relationship between years of living in an infested house and parasite load. Conclusions/Significance: We hypothesize that sustained vector-borne parasite exposure and repeated superinfection by T. cruzi may act as an immune booster, allowing women to maintain effective control of the parasite despite the down-regulation of late pregnancy.

N2  - Background: The benign character formerly attributed to Plasmodium vivax infection has been dismantled by the increasing number of reports of severe disease associated with infection with this parasite, prompting the need for more thorough and comprehensive characterization of the spectrum of resulting clinical complications. Endemic areas exhibit wide variations regarding severe disease frequency. This study, conducted simultaneously in Brazil and India, constitutes, to our knowledge, the first multisite study focused on clinical characterization of P. vivax severe disease. Methods: Patients admitted with P. vivax mono-infection at reference centers in Manaus (Amazon - Brazil) and Bikaner (Rajasthan - India), where P. vivax predominates, were submitted to standard thorough clinical and laboratory evaluations in order to characterize clinical manifestations and identify concurrent co-morbidities. Results: In total, 778 patients (88.0% above 12 years old) were hospitalized at clinical discretion with PCR-confirmed P. vivax mono-infection (316 in Manaus and 462 in Bikaner), of which 197 (25.3%) presented at least one severity criterion as defined by the World Health Organization (2010). Hyperlactatemia, respiratory distress, hypoglycemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation were more frequent in Manaus. Noteworthy, pregnancy status was associated as a risk factor for severe disease (OR = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.2-3.4; P = 0.007). The overall case fatality rate was 0.3/1,000 cases in Manaus and 6.1/1,000 cases in Bikaner, with all deaths occurring among patients fulfilling at least one severity criterion. Within this subgroup, case fatality rates increased respectively to 7.5% in Manaus and 4.4% in Bikaner. Conclusion: P. vivax-associated severity is not negligible, and although lethality observed for complicated cases was similar, the overall fatality rate was about 20-fold higher in India compared to Brazil, highlighting the variability observed in different settings. Our observations highlight that pregnant women and patients with co-morbidities need special attention when infected by this parasite due to higher risk of complications.

N2  - Background: To evaluate the association between fasting glucose levels in women throughout pregnancy and the occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and other pregnancy complications, macrosomia, and cesarean delivery. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study with 829 healthy pregnant women receiving health care at a public maternity unit in Rio de Janeiro between 1999 and 2008. The dependent variables assessed in the study were: GDM (was confirmed when two or more values were above the glucose curve using 100 g glucose), complications, mode of delivery and birth weight. Macrosomia was defined as a birth weight of >4000 g. The independent variables assessed were: maternal fasting glucose per trimester as a continuous variable, divided into three categories, socio-demographic data on the mothers. The level of statistical significance was set at 5%. Results: The mean fasting glucose levels of the women who had GDM were higher in the second trimester than for those who had no pregnancy complications (90.5 mg/dL vs. 78.5 mg/dL, p = 0.000). Higher mean fasting glucose levels were also found in the third trimester for women who developed GDM than for those with no pregnancy complications (90 mg/dL vs. 77.8 mg/dL, p = 0.016). Women who had a cesarean delivery had higher fasting glucose levels in the second (80.4 mg/dL vs. 78 mg/dL, post hoc = 0.034) and third (80.4 mg/dL and 77.1 mg/dL; post hoc = 0.005) trimesters than women who had a normal delivery. Also, higher fasting glucose levels were found in the second semester for women whose infants had macrosomia than for women whose newborns were normal weight (86.2 mg/dL and 78.8 mg/dL; post hoc = 0.003). The chance of develop GDM was higher for the women with glucose levels in the 90-94 mg/dL range in the second trimester (OR = 7.2; 95% CI = 2.33-22.24) than for the women whose glucose levels were in the <80 mg/dL and 80-90 mg/dL ranges. Conclusion: Second and third trimester fasting glucose levels below the cut-off values for the diagnosis of GDM are associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications. The dependent variables assessed in the study were: GDM (present/absent), complications, mode of delivery (normal, forceps, cesarean), and birth weight.

N2  - Little is known about the association between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and anxiety disorders during pregnancy. We evaluated this association at the first pregnancy trimester in 228 women. The study endpoint was the diagnosis of any anxiety disorder assessed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The independent variables were the serum concentrations of total n-3 and fractions (18:2, 20:5, 22:5, 22:6), total n-6 and fractions (18:2, 18:3, 20:2, 20:3, 20:4, 22:4, 22:5) and the n-6/n-3 ratio PUFAs. The prevalence of any anxiety disorders was 25%. The first tertile of the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 n-3) distribution represented 1.95 (95% CI: 1.00-3.77) higher chance of having an anxiety disorder diagnosis, compared to those in the second and third tertiles after adjusting the analyses for parity, family income, early pregnancy BMI and gestational age at the blood sampling. Serum concentrations of DHA were inversely associated with the occurrence of early pregnancy anxiety disorders.

N2  - Introduction: suspected appendicitis is the most common indication for surgery in non-obstetric conditions during pregnancy and occurs in about one in 500 to one in 635 pregnancies per year. This occurs more often in the second trimester of pregnancy. Acute appendicitis is the most common general surgical problem encountered during pregnancy. Methods: a literature review on research of scientific articles, under the terms "acute appendicitis" and "pregnancy", in PubMed, Lilacs/SciELO, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Uptodate databases. Results: the clinical manifestations of appendicitis are similar to non-pregnant women, however, without a classic presentation, which often occurs, diagnosis is difficult and must be supported by imaging. Discussion: clinical diagnosis should be strongly suspected in pregnant women with classic findings such as abdominal pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant. The main purpose of imaging is to reduce delays in surgical intervention due to diagnostic uncertainty. A secondary objective is to reduce, but not eliminate, the negative appendectomy rate. Differential diagnosis of suspected acute appendicitis usually includes pathologies considered in non-pregnant people. Conclusion: the imaging study of choice is ultrasound, MRI may be used when the former is not conclusive and, as a last resort, a CT scan can be performed. The treatment remains appendectomy by laparotomy, since the feasibility of videoassisted surgery in these cases remains controversial.

N2  - Background: The rate of vertical HIV transmission has decreased in Brazil, but regional inequalities suggest problems in implementing control measures during pregnancy and delivery. The aims of this study were to ascertain the coverage of HIV testing during prenatal care and estimate the prevalence of HIV infection during pregnancy in Brazil. Methods: This was a national hospital-based study of 23,894 women that was conducted in 2011-2012. The data came from interviews with mothers during postpartum hospitalization, from hospital medical files and from prenatal cards. All the pregnant women with reactive serological results for HIV infection marked on their cards or with diagnoses of HIV infection during the hospital stay for delivery were considered cases of HIV infection. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were performed to investigate factors associated with the prevalence of HIV infection and with performing at least one HIV test during pregnancy. Results: Among participating women, the coverage of testing for HIV infection was 81.7% among those who presented with prenatal card and the prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant women was 0.4% (95% CI: 0.32-0.51%). In the adjusted analysis, there was higher coverage of testing among women living in the South and Southeast regions; of women aged 35 years and over; with greater schooling levels; who self-reported as white; with prenatal care provided in private services; with an early start to prenatal care; and with an adequate number of consultations, defined as a minimum of six for a term pregnancy. In the adjusted analyses there was a greater odds ratio of HIV infection among women living in the South region, aged 35 years and over, with schooling of less than 8 years, who self-reported race as black, without a partner, with syphilis coinfection and who were attended by public services. Conclusions: The prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant women in Brazil remains below 1% and the coverage of testing for HIV infection is over 80%. However, the regional and social inequalities in access to healthcare services and the missed opportunities for diagnoses of HIV infection indicate the importance of strengthening HIV infection control programs during pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Leptin concentrations increase throughout pregnancy but little is known about factors that influence this physiological change and whether they differ according to pregestational body mass index (BMI). Objective: To assess whether longitudinal trends of leptin in pregnancy are influenced by biochemical, anthropometric and lifestyle factors in women with normal weight (NW), overweight (OW) or obese (OB) pregestational BMI. Design and methods: Prospective cohort of 232 pregnant women followed at 5-13th, 20-26th and 30-36th gestational weeks. The effect of selected variables on longitudinal behaviour of plasma leptin concentrations, stratifying for NW (18.5-24.9 kg/m2), OW (25-29.9 kg/m2) and OB (≥30.0 kg/m2) pregestational BMI was assessed through longitudinal linear mixed-effects models. Results: The multiple regression model for women with NW revealed associations of maternal body weight (β = 0.714, CI = 0.491 to 0.937), serum HDL-cholesterol (β = 0.239, CI = 0.089 to 0.388) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (β = -0.138, CI = -0.272 to -0.004) with plasma leptin concentrations. Maternal body weight (β = -0.871, CI = 0.475 to 1.267) and serum HDL-cholesterol concentrations (β = 0.315, CI = -0.022 to 0.651) were also associated with leptin in OW women. In OB women, serum HDL-cholesterol (β = 0.722, CI = 0.219 to 1.226), maternal body weight (β = 0.666, CI = 0.187 to 1.145), triglycerides concentrations (β = -0.130, CI = -0.241 to -0.020) and dietary carbohydrate (β = 0.075, CI = 0.023 to 0.126) were significantly associated with plasma leptin. Conclusion: Maternal body weight and serum concentrations of HDL-cholesterol were associated with leptin changes independent of pregestational BMI. Serum CRP concentrations were associated with leptin only in NW women and serum triglycerides concentrations and dietary carbohydrate only in OB. These results indicate that factors that influence leptin concentrations differ according to pregestational BMI.

N2  - Antenatal anxiety may increase the risk of undesirable birth outcomes. Studies have demonstrated an association between adiponectin and anxiety, but this issue has not been investigated during pregnancy. This study aimed to evaluate the association between plasma adiponectin, measured throughout gestation, and the occurrence of anxiety at late pregnancy (30-36th weeks). A prospective cohort was investigated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Healthy pregnant women, aged 20-40 years, were evaluated between gestational weeks 5-13, 22-26 and 30-36. State anxiety was measured using a validated version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and women were categorized as high (score. ≥. 50, n=. 30) or low anxiety (score. <. 50, n=. 129). Plasma samples for all trimesters were analyzed using commercial ELISA kits to determine adiponectin concentrations (U/mL). Statistical analysis involved student's t-tests, chi-square, Pearson correlation, multiple logistic regression and linear mixed effects (LME) regression to model longitudinal trends of adiponectin, stratified for anxiety categories. Women with higher anxiety scores had lower mean concentrations of 3rd trimester adiponectin compared with those with lower scores (7.9; 95% CI: 7.0-8.9 vs. 9.9; 95% CI: 9.1-10.7). Women with 3rd trimester adiponectin values within the third tertile (10.47-26.57. U/mL) were less likely to have high antenatal anxiety (adjusted OR. =. 0.30; 95% CI: 0.09-0.98) compared with those within the first tertile (2.25-7.08. U/mL). Unlike women with low levels of anxiety, those with high levels had a significant decrease of plasma adiponectin throughout pregnancy (. β=. -0.07; 95% CI: -0.13. -. [-0.01] vs. β=. -0.01; 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.03). Multiple LME model indicated higher adiponectin throughout pregnancy for women with low anxiety (. β=. -1.57; 95% CI: -2.78. -. [-0.37]). In conclusion, plasma adiponectin throughout pregnancy was inversely associated with antenatal anxiety.

N2  - Background: Folate and vitamin B12 are essential nutrients, whose deficiencies are considerable public health problems worldwide, affecting all age groups. Low levels of these vitamins have been associated with high concentrations of homocysteine (Hcy) and can lead to health complications. Several genetic polymorphisms affect the metabolism of these vitamins. The aims of this study were to assess folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine status in distinct Brazilian individuals after the initiation of folic acid fortification by Brazilian authorities and to investigate the effects of RFC1 A80G, GCPII C1561T and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms on folate, vitamin B12 and Hcy levels in these populations. Methods: A total of 719 individuals including the elderly, children, as well as pregnant and lactating women were recruited from our health care center. Folate, vitamin B12 and Hcy levels were measured by conventional methods. Genotype analyses of RFC1 A80G, GCPII C1561T and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms were performed by PCR-RFLP. Results: The overall prevalence of folate and vitamin B12 deficiencies were 0.3% and 4.9%, respectively. Folate deficiency was observed only in the elderly (0.4%) and pregnant women (0.3%), whereas vitamin B12 deficiency was observed mainly in pregnant women (7.9%) and the elderly (4.2%). Plasma Hcy concentrations were significantly higher in the elderly (33.6%). Pregnant women carrying the MTHFR 677TT genotype showed lower serum folate levels (p = 0.042) and higher Hcy levels (p = 0.003). RFC1 A80G and GCPII C1561T polymorphisms did not affect folate and Hcy levels in the study group. After a multivariate analysis, Hcy levels were predicted by variables such as folate, vitamin B12, gender, age and RFC1 A80G polymorphism, according to the groups studied. Conclusion: Our results suggest that folate deficiency is practically nonexistent in the post-folic acid fortification era in the subgroups evaluated. However, screening for vitamin B12 deficiency may be particularly relevant in our population, especially in the elderly.

N2  - This article evaluates the association of hepatic, renal, and inflammatory biomarkers with changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure (BP) during healthy pregnancies. A prospective cohort study with 225 healthy pregnant women was conducted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. SBP and DBP were evaluated throughout pregnancy (5th-13th, 20th-26th, and 30th-36th gestational weeks) and were the outcomes. The following biomarkers were measured at the first trimester and analyzed according to tertiles of the sample distribution and were considered the main independent predictors: alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), uric acid (UA), creatinine (Cr), and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. The statistical analysis included 3 stages of modeling with the longitudinal linear mixed-effects procedures: Model 1 was adjusted for gestational age and quadratic gestational age; Model 2 included interactions between the biomarkers and gestational age; and Model 3 was adjusted for selfreported skin color, education, parity, early-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (under/normal < 25; overweight/obese > 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), smoking habit, and leisure-time physical activity. Additional models were performed for CRP and UA with the inclusion of interaction terms between the biomarkers and BMI. Women classified in the third tertile of the ALP (>61.1 U/L; β<inf>SBP</inf>=3.474; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.955-5.992; β<inf>DBP</inf>=3.291; 95% CI: 1.098-5.485), ALT (>14.3 U/L; β<inf>SBP</inf>=2.232; 2.232; 95% CI: 0.221-4.242; β<inf>DBP</inf>=2.355; 95% CI: 0.721-3.989), and Cr values (>48.6μmol/L; β<inf>DBP</inf>=1.927; 95% CI: 0.347-3.508) presented higher BP levels during pregnancy compared to those in the first and second tertiles. Women in the highest tertile of the ALP concentration distribution presented a lower rate of change in SBP and DBP during pregnancy (interaction term with gestational age β<inf>SBP</inf>=0.004; 95% CI: -0.007 to -0.001; P=0.02; β<inf>DBP</inf>=-0.003; 95% CI: -0.006 to -0.001; P=0.01). Higher UA concentrations were associated with higher SBP levels only in overweight/obese women (β=3.878; 95% CI: 0.687-7.068), whereas higher CRP concentrations (>2.6 mg/L) were associated with higher DBP in under/normal weight women (β=2.252; 95% CI: 0.267-4.236). ALP, ALT, and Cr concentrations were positively associated with BP levels, whereas ALP was associated with a lower rate of change in BP. The associations of UA and CRP with BP differ according to the early-pregnancy BMI.

N2  - Epidemiological and animal studies have shown that placental undernutrition impairs reproduction in adult offspring, but the underlying molecular mechanisms within the male genital tract remain unknown. Due to its special physiological characteristics in transport and the modulation of the environment to which its luminal content is exposed, we hypothesized that the vas deferens would be a highly sensitive target. The goals were to investigate whether intrauterine malnutrition affects molecular mechanisms related to Ca2+- and oxidative stress-modulated processes and causes structural alterations in the adult rat vas deferens that could attenuate fecundity and fertility. Male adult rats malnourished in utero had increased vas deferens weight associated with thickening of the muscular coat, a decrease in the total and haploid germ cells, a marked increase in the immature cells, and a decline in the numbers of pregnant females and total offspring per male rat. The ex vivo response of vas deferens from malnourished rats demonstrated an accentuated decrease in the contractile response to phenylephrine. The vas deferens had a marked decrease in Ca2+ transport due to the uncoupling of Ca2+-stimulated ATP hydrolysis and ATP-driven Ca2+ flux, and the downregulation of both sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 2 and the coupling factor 12-kDa FK506- binding protein. An increase in protein carbonylation (a marker of oxidative damage) and an imbalance between protein kinases C and A were observed as a legacy of undernutrition in early life. These results provide the structural and molecular basis to explain at least in part how maternal undernutrition affects fecundity and fertility in adult male rats.

N2  - Objectives: Describe the epidemiological profile of pregnant diagnosed with pre-eclampsia (PE) as well as the outcome of obstetric and neonatal. Methods: Cohort study conducted by collecting data from 45 pregnant women diagnosed with PE that gave birth during the years 2012 and 2013 at Guilherme Álvaro Hospital, Santos-SP, Brazil. The survey was conducted from the hospital records of these women and their newborns since their admission until delivery. The diagnosis of PE followed the recommendations do National High Blood Pressure Education program-2000. Results: The descriptive analysis from the study group has an average age of 28 years (18-35 years old), preferably residents from Santos, white race and first pregnancy. Laboratory features presented were hemoglobin 10.9 ≥1.7 mg/dL and hematocrit 32.7≥5.4%. Regarding proteinuria, 80% of diagnoses were determined by 24-h sample and 20% by dipstick. As obstetric results obtained in 6.7% vaginal delivery, cesarean section in 93.3%, hypertensive crisis in the puerperium in 28.9%, use of hydralazine in 42.2%, a PE was classified as mild preeclampsia in 48.9%, severe in 28.9% and 22.2% superimposed. The premature newborns were 66.7%, regular birth weight in 55.6% and Apgar ≥7 at first and fifth minute 72.7% and 90.9%, respectively. Conclusions: Considering the high rate of Caesarean section, the productive age group of the lives of women most affected and prematurity can identify the potential of hypertensive disorders causing adverse social and perinatal outcomes. Puerperal complications represented primarily by hypertensive crises, stresses the need for skilled care and also during this period of pregnancy/cycle puerperal. These results may signal the need to adopt common strategies to prevent or reduce the damage from these disorders contributing to the improvement of the indicators pursued in obstetric care.

N2  - After the World Health Organization officially declared the end of the first pandemic of the XXI century in August 2010, the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus has been disseminated in the human population. In spite of its sustained circulation, very little on phylogenetic data or oseltamivir (OST) resistance is available for the virus in equatorial regions of South America. In order to shed more light on this topic, we analysed the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 positive samples collected during the pandemic period in the Pernambuco (PE), a northeastern Brazilian state. Complete HA sequences were compared and amino acid changes were related to clinical outcome. In addition, the H275Y substitution in NA, associated with OST resistance, was investigated by pyrosequencing. Samples from PE were grouped in phylogenetic clades 6 and 7, being clustered together with sequences from South and Southeast Brazil. The D222N/G HA gene mutation, associated with severity, was found in one deceased patient that was pregnant. Additionally, the HA mutation K308E, which appeared in Brazil in 2010 and was only detected worldwide the following year, was identified in samples from hospitalised cases. The resistance marker H275Y was not identified in samples tested. However, broader studies are needed to establish the real frequency of resistance in this Brazilian region.

N2  - Introduction: The epidemiology associated with Chagas disease is well known in its chronic form. The acute phase still little discussed presents diagnostic difficulties. Objectives: To identify the clinical and epidemiological features of acute Chagas disease. Methods: The study is cross-sectional and descriptive. Data were collected in the Information System for Notifiable Diseases in Brazil, in December 2013 The sample consisted of 791 new cases of Chagas disease with definitive laboratory diagnosis between 2007 and 2011 As new cases reported in the years 2012 and 2013 were not definitive, were excluded from this study. The indicators were described by descriptive statistics on two axes: risk and disease-disease-death, supported by SPSS 22.0 software. Results: Men (51%) had the highest frequency of the disease. Infected women, 6% were pregnant. Most patients (31%) was 20-39 years. 81.2% had brown race. The primary site of infection was the household (89%). Most cases (94%) was located in the North, the Northeast, with 4.5% and the Midwest region 1.5% of cases. The South and Southeast regions had no cases in the period. The state of Pará had 80% of cases of the northern region, the State of Maranhão 83% of the Northeast and the State of Goiás 67% of cases the Midwest region. The forms of transmission were vertically (from 0.2%), through accidental (0.3%), blood transfusion (1%), vector form (8.5%) and oral (90%). The clinical evolution to death because mortis-Chagas was 2.5%. Conclusions: It is important to emphasize the high clinical probability of death and the change to the oral route of transmission. More studies in acute Chagas Disease allow better diagnosis and prognosis.

N2  - PURPOSE: Pregnant women have a 2-3 fold higher probability of developing restless legs syndrome (RLS - sleep-related movement disorders) than general population. This study aims to evaluate the behavior and locomotion of rats during pregnancy in order to verify if part of these animals exhibit some RLS-like features.
METHODS: We used 14 female 80-day-old Wistar rats that weighed between 200 and 250 g. The rats were distributed into control (CTRL) and pregnant (PN) groups. After a baseline evaluation of their behavior and locomotor activity in an open-field environment, the PN group was inducted into pregnancy, and their behavior and locomotor activity were evaluated on days 3, 10 and 19 of pregnancy and in the post-lactation period in parallel with the CTRL group. The serum iron and transferrin levels in the CTRL and PN groups were analyzed in blood collected after euthanasia by decapitation.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the total ambulation, grooming events, fecal boli or urine pools between the CTRL and PN groups. However, the PN group exhibited fewer rearing events, increased grooming time and reduced immobilization time than the CTRL group (ANOVA, p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that pregnant rats show behavioral and locomotor alterations similar to those observed in animal models of RLS, demonstrating to be a possible animal model of this sleep disorder.

N2  - The objective is to identify factors associated with women's satisfaction towards the care provided by the health professionals during hospital assisted delivery and identify how those factors influence their general levels of satisfaction. The cohort hospital based study was carried out in connection with the Birth in Brazil research. 15,688 women were included, interviewed at home, through the phone, from March 2011 to February 2012. All the variables that compose the professional/pregnant woman relationship (waiting time, respect, privacy, clarity of explanations, possibility of asking questions and participating in the decisions) and schooling remained independently associated with general satisfaction towards delivery care, in the adjusted model. The white women assisted in the southeastern and southern regions of the country, by the private sector and with a companion present gave a better evaluation of the care provided. Women value the way in which they are assisted by the health professionals, and there are inequalities in the way they are treated based on skin color, geographic region and financial situation.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Fetal exposure to maternal tobacco smoke (MTS) leads to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Both MTS and IUGR independently program offspring obesity. Obesity development depends, in part, on endocannabinoid system (ECS). The type 1 cannabinoid receptor is a product of the Cnr1 gene. Cnr1 expression is decreased in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in obesity. Gene expression and metabolic programming are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as methylation of DNA. Whether MTS or surgically induced-IUGR (sIUGR) alters Cnr1 mRNA expression or DNA methylation of the Cnr1 gene in rat VAT is unknown. We hypothesize that MTS and sIUGR decrease Cnr1 mRNA expression and alter DNA methylation in the promoter of the Cnr1 in VAT rat offspring. METHODS: Pregnant rats were exposed to tobacco smoke from embryonic day 11 to term (MTS). Postnatally, MTS offspring were cross fostered to control dams. sIUGR was induced by bilateral uterine artery ligation on gestational day 19. At weaning, offspring VAT was collected. Cnr1 mRNA levels were quantified. DNA methylation of the proximal promoter, transcriptional start site and intron 1 of the Cnr1 was evaluated by bisulfite modification and sequencing. RESULTS: Results are reported as MTS or sIUGR as % of sex-matched controls (∗p<0.05). In female offspring, MTS and sIUGR decreased mRNA levels of Cnr1 in VAT (10%∗ and 53%∗, respectively). MTS and sIUGR increased methylation of CpG's in the proximal promoter of the Cnr1 gene of female VAT (166%∗ and 150%∗, respectively). In contrast, MTS decreased DNA methylation in the intronic region of the Cnr1 gene (65%∗) in female VAT with no changes in sIUGR female rats. In male offspring, MTS did not alter VAT Cnr1 mRNA levels or DNA methylation. However, sIUGR increased Cnr1 mRNA levels (195%∗) without changes in DNA methylation of the Cnr1 gene. CONCLUSIONS: MTS and sIUGR alter Cnr1 mRNA expression and DNA methylation in a model and sex-specific manner in rat VAT. The CpG density of the Cnr1 gene promoter is relatively low. Increased methylation in the transcriptional start of genes with low density CpG's is frequently associated with decreased gene expression. We speculate that MTS and sIUGR increased DNA methylation in the transcriptional start of Cnr1 gene programming decreased expression of Cnr1 in VAT of female offspring.

N2  - Background: As the most frequent pathway of vertical transmission of HTLV-1 is breast-feeding, and considering the higher prevalence in women, it is very important to perform screening examinations for anti-HTLV-1 antibodies as part of routine prenatal care. So far, no studies of HTLV-1 seroprevalence in pregnant women in the Southern region of Bahia, Brazil, have been described. Methods. Pregnant women were selected at the two regional reference centers for health care from Southern Bahia. A total of 2766 pregnant women attending the antenatal unit between November 2008 and May 2010 have been analyzed. An extra blood sample was drawn during their routine antenatal testing. A standardized questionnaire was applied and all positive plasma samples were tested by ELISA and were confirmed by Western Blot and PCR. Besides that, positive women were contacted and visited. The family members that were present during the visit were asked to be serologically screened to the virus. A prospective study was also carried out and newborns were followed up to two years for evaluation of vertical transmission. Results: HTLV prevalence was 1.05% (CI 95%: 0.70-1.50). There was no association of HTLV-1 infection with age, education, income and ethnic differences. The association with marital status was borderline (OR = 7.99; 95% CI 1.07-59.3; p = 0.042). In addition, 43 family members of the HTLV-1 seropositive women have been analyzed and specific reactivity was observed in 32.56%, including two children from previous pregnancy.Conclusion:It is very important to emphasize that the lack of HTLV-1 screening in pregnant women can promote HTLV transmission especially in endemic areas. HTLV screening in this vulnerable population and the promotion of bottle-feeding for children of seropositive mothers could be important cost-effective methods to limit the vertical transmission. Besides that, our data reinforce the need to establish strategies of active surveillance in household and family contacts as important epidemiological surveillance actions for the early detection of virus infection and the prevention of transmission by sexual or and parenteral contact. © 2014 Mello et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Inadequate weight gain during pregnancy is an important predictor of complications for the mother and infant. This cross-sectional study assessed factors associated with inadequate weight gain among women in the third trimester of pregnancy who received prenatal care under the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from November 2007 to July 2008. A total of 1,079 pregnant women were interviewed, and adequacy of weight gain was obtained by calculating weight gain as recommended by the U.S. Institute of Medicine. Social, demographic, and obstetric factors were analyzed as independent variables. A multinomial logistic regression model was used, and pregnant women with weight gain below or above the recommended levels were compared to those with adequate weight gain. Low schooling was associated with insufficient weight gain, while excessive gain was observed in women with hypertension and pre-gestational underweight, overweight, and obesity. Nutritional assessment during prenatal care is essential, and interventions should target cases of inadequate weight gain in order to prevent complications for the mother and infant.

N2  - A lopinavir-ritonavir (LPV/r)-based regimen is recommended during pregnancy to reduce the risk of HIV mother-to-child transmission, but the appropriate dose is controversial. We compared the pharmacokinetics of standard and increased LPV/r doses during pregnancy. This randomized, open-label prospective study enrolled 60 pregnant women between gestational weeks 14 and 30. The participants received either the standard dose (400/100 mg twice a day [BID]) or increased dose (600/150 mg BID) of LPV/r tablets during pregnancy and the standard dose for 6 weeks after childbirth. Pharmacokinetics analysis was performed using a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Adherent participants who received the standard dose presented minimum LPV concentrations of 4.4, 4.3, and 6.1 μg/ml in the second and third trimesters and postpartum, respectively. The increased-dose group exhibited values of 7.9, 6.9, and 9.2 μg/ml at the same three time points. Although LPV exposure was significantly higher in the increased-dose group, the standard dose produced therapeutic levels of LPV against wild-type virus in all adherent participants, except one patient in the third trimester; 50%, 37.5%, and 25%, and 0%, 15%, and 0% of the participants in the standard- and increased-dose groups failed to achieve therapeutic levels against resistant viruses during the second and third trimesters and after childbirth, respectively. After 12 weeks of treatment and after childbirth, all adherent participants achieved undetectable HIV viral loads, and their babies (49/54) were uninfected. No serious drug-related adverse events were observed. We conclude that the standard dose is appropriate for use during pregnancy and that an increased dose may be necessary for women harboring resistant HIV.

N2  - Chagas disease induces a strong immune response and l-arginine is an essential amino acid which plays an important role in homeostasis of the immune system. The aims of this study were to evaluate parasitemia, corticosterone levels, production of nitric oxide (NO), fetal morphological measurements, and histology of heart and placenta. Twenty pregnant Wistar rats (180-220g) were grouped in: pregnant control (PC), pregnant control and l-arginine supplied (PCA), pregnant infected (PI), pregnant infected and l-arginine supplied (PIA). Females were infected with 1×105 trypomastigotes of the Y strain (3rd day of pregnancy). Animals were supplied with 21mg of l-arginine/kg/day during 14days. PIA showed significant decreased levels of corticosterone and parasitemia. For control groups, any alteration in NO production was found with l-arginine supplementation; for PIA, enhanced nitrite concentrations were observed as compared to PI. Weights and lengths of fetuses were higher in l-arginine treated and infected pregnant rats as compared to untreated ones. Placental weight from the PIA group was significantly increased when compared to PI. In l-arginine treated animals, cardiac tissue showed reduced amastigote burdens. PIA and PI displayed similar placental parasitism. Based on these results, l-arginine supplementation may be potentially useful for the protection against Trypanosoma cruzi during pregnancy. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women and the risk of congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in Brazil, through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We searched electronic databases, grey literature and reference lists of included publications to identify epidemiological studies on the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women and on the congenital transmission rate of T. cruzi infection in Brazil published between January 1980 and June 2013. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using fixed- and random-effects models. Results: Sixteen articles were included - 12 studies on the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women (549 359 pregnant women) and nine on congenital transmission rates (1687 children born to infected mothers). Prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women ranged from 0.1% to 8.5%, and congenital transmission rates from 0% to 5.2%. The pooled prevalence of Chagas disease among pregnant women across studies was 1.1% (95% CI: 0.6-2.0); the pooled congenital transmission rate was 1.7% (95% CI: 0.9-3.1). In 2010, 34 629 pregnant women were estimated to be infected with T. cruzi, and 312-1073 children born (mean: 589 cases) with congenital infection. Conclusion: Congenital Chagas disease is a neglected public health problem in Brazil. Systematic congenital Chagas disease control programs through routine prenatal screening for T. cruzi should be widely implemented in Brazil's endemic areas, to identify infected pregnant women and newborns at risk of congenital infection. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - Objective To estimate the prevalence of suicide risk (SR) and major depressive episodes (MDEs) in early pregnancy, as well as the relationship of serum fatty acid status to these outcomes. Methods Cross-sectional analyses were performed on data from 234 pregnant women enrolled in a prospective cohort study in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. SR and MDE were defined according to the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Fatty acid compositions were determined for serum samples obtained between the 6th and 13th gestational week. Fatty acid data were expressed as the percent of total fatty acids, converted to Z scores and then entered as continuous variables in logistic regression models. Results The prevalence of SR was 19.6% and that of MDE was 17.0%. In the adjusted logistic regressions, a higher likelihood of SR was observed among women with higher arachidonic acid levels [AA (20:4, n-6): OR=1.45, 95%CI 1.02-2.07] and adrenic acid levels [AdA (22:4, n-6): OR=1.43, 95%CI 1.01-2.04]. A higher likelihood of MDE was also observed among women with higher AA levels [OR=1.47, 95%CI 1.03-2.10] and AdA levels [OR=1.59, 95%CI 1.09-2.32]. Conclusion Higher serum levels of AA and AdA were associated with a greater likelihood of SR and MDE among pregnant Brazilian women. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Lipids and leptin have been associated with high blood pressure (BP) levels during pregnancy. The aim was to evaluate the associations between serum lipids and leptin concentrations during the first trimester and longitudinal changes of SBP and DBP in healthy pregnancies. METHODS: Prospective cohort of pregnant women followed at a public healthcare center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. SBP and DBP were obtained at the ≤13th, 20-26th, and 30-36th weeks of gestation and were the dependent variables. Serum lipids and plasma leptin concentrations were collected at 13 weeks or less of gestation and were the main independent variables. Statistical analyses included longitudinal linear mixed-effects regression models, with (β) coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Mean BPs were 109.8/66.9, 107.8/64.3, and 111.2/66.9mmHg, respectively in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester. Multiple longitudinal regressions revealed that leisure time physical activity before pregnancy (βSBP=-3.003, 95% CI=-5.034 to -0.971; βDBP=-2.620, 95% CI=-4.177 to -1.064), baseline BMI (βSBP=4.003, 95% CI=1.924-6.081; βDBP=1.862, 95% CI=0.252-3.412), parity (βSBP=-2.778, 95% CI=-4.627 to -0.929; βDBP=-1.780, 95% CI = -3.168 to -0.392), and Homeostasis model of assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR; βSBP=2.554, 95% CI=0.552-4.557; βDBP=2.962, 95% CI=1.436-4.489) were the covariates independently associated with SBP and DBP changes. Monthly per-capita family income (βSBP=-0.006, 95% CI=-0.010 to -0.001), total cholesterol (βSBP=2.094, 95% CI=0.223-3.965), and leptin (βSBP=2.211, 95% CI=0.159-4.263) were associated only with SBP changes. CONCLUSION: Serum total cholesterol and leptin concentrations, HOMA-IR, and BMI were positively associated with changes in BP during healthy pregnancies, whereas physical activity, parity, and family income were negatively associated. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

N2  - Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains an important cause of new HIV infections worldwide, especially in low and middle-resource limited countries. Safety data from studies involving pregnant women and prenatal antiretroviral (ARV) exposure are still needed once these studies are often small and with a limited duration to assess adverse drug reactions (ADR). The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of ADR related to the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnant women in two referral centers in Rio de Janeiro State. A prospective study was carried out from February 2005 to May 2006. Women were classified according to their ART status during pregnancy diagnosis: ARV-experienced (ARTexp) or ARV-naïve (ARTn). Two hundred fourteen HIV-infected pregnant women were included: 36 ARTexp and 178 ARTn. ARTexp women have not experienced ADR. Among ARTn, 20.2% presented ADR. Incidence rate of ADR was 70.8 per 1000 person-months and the most common ADRs observed were: gastrointestinal (belly or abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea and vomit) in 16.3%, cutaneous (pruritus and rash) in 6.2%, anemia (2.2%) and hepatitis (1.7%). The frequency of obstetrical complications, pre-term delivery, low birth weight and birth abnormalities was low in this population. ADRs ranged from mild to moderate intensity, none of them being potentially fatal. Only in a few cases it was necessary to discontinue ART. In conclusion, the high effectiveness of ARV for HIV prevention of MTCT (PMTCT) overcomes the risk of ADR. © 2014 Elsevier Editora Ltda.

N2  - Introduction: Antiretroviral (ARV) drug use during pregnancy significantly reduces mother-to-child HIV transmission, delays disease progression in the women and reduces the risk of HIV transmission to HIV-serodiscordant partners. Pregnant women are susceptible to the same adverse reactions to ARVs as nonpregnant adults as well as to specific pregnancy-related reactions. In addition, we should consider adverse pregnancy outcomes and adverse reactions in children exposed to ARVs during intrauterine life. However, studies designed to assess the safety of ARV in pregnant women are rare, usually with few participants and short follow-up periods.Areas covered: In this review, we discuss studies reporting adverse reactions to ARV drugs, including maternal toxicity, adverse pregnancy outcomes and the consequences of exposure to ARV in infants. We included results of observational studies, both prospective and retrospective, as well as randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-Analyses.Expert opinion: The benefits of ARV use during pregnancy outweigh the risks of adverse reactions identified to date. More studies are needed to assess the adverse effects in the medium-And long term in children exposed to ARVs during pregnancy, as well as pregnant women using lifelong antiretroviral therapy and more recently available drugs.

N2  - Serum lipids have been associated with depression in the adult population; however, this association during pregnancy remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between serum lipids and depressive symptom scores during pregnancy. A prospective cohort of 238 pregnant women was followed at the 5th-13th, 20th-26th and 30th-36th weeks of gestation. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Serum concentrations (mg/dL) of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low- and high-density lipoproteins (LDL-c; HDL-c) were the main exposures. Marital status (married/single), physical activity (active or very active/low or very low active), unplanned pregnancy (no/yes), pre-pregnancy BMI (<25/≥25kg/m2), generalized anxiety disorder (no/yes) and current suicidal ideation (no/yes) were considered as potential confounders. Analyses were performed using linear mixed-effects models. The results showed that the EPDS mean score (95%CI) decreased with time during pregnancy trimesters [1st: 8.89 (95%CI=8.28-9.51), 2nd: 7.32 (95%CI=6.67-7.97) and 3rd: 7.08 (95%CI=6.41-7.74)]. Suicidal ideation frequency at baseline was 18%. HDL-c concentrations were inversely associated with changes in EPDS score (β=-0.080, 95%CI=-0.157 to-0.002), while low or very low active women (β=1.288, 95%CI=0.630-1.946), with single marital status (β=1.348, 95%CI=0.163-2.534), unplanned pregnancy (β=1.922, 95%CI=0.714-3.131), generalized anxiety disorder (β=2.139, 95%CI=0.410-3.868) and current suicidal ideation (β=1.927, 95%CI=0.596-3.258) tended to have higher EPDS scores. No relationship was observed between other lipids and EPDS scores. HDL-c concentration was inversely associated with changes in depressive symptom scores during pregnancy after adjusting for socio-economic, demographic, behavioral, nutritional, biochemical and mental health disorders.

N2  - This study aimed to describe the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and to identify the factors associated with Current Suicide Risk (CSR) in the first trimester of pregnancy. The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) was employed to diagnose mental disorders in 239 women enrolled in a prospective cohort in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Serum lipids, leptin and socio-economic status were the independent variables. CSR, the dependent variable, was entered as binary (yes/no) variable into crude and adjusted Poisson regression models with robust variances. CSR was found to be the main psychiatric syndrome (18.4%), followed by agoraphobia (17.2%), major depressive disorder (15.1%) and generalized anxiety disorder (10.5%). Women with CSR showed higher mean levels of cholesterol (169.2 vs. 159.2; p=0.017), high density lipoprotein (50.4 vs. 47.7; p=0.031) and low density lipoprotein (102.8 vs. 95.6; p=0.022) when compared to women without CSR. The adjusted regression model showed a higher prevalence ratio (PR) of CSR among pregnant women with generalized anxiety disorder (PR=2.70, 95% CI: 1.36-5.37), with ≥two parturitions (PR=2.46, 95% CI: 1.22-4.93), and with major depressive disorder (PR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.08-4.12). We have shown that generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder and higher parity are associated with CSR in the first trimester of pregnancy. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Ethnopharmacological relevance Byrsonima verbascifolia is used in folk medicine to treat diarrhea, intestinal infections, chronic wounds, Chagas disease, inflammation and as a diuretic. However there is no investigation regarding the Byrsonima verbascifolia hydrometanolic extract (BVHME) used during gestation. Materials and methods The pregnant females were randomly divided into 5 groups. Control group received saline plus DMSO (1%) in a volume of 0.1 mL/10 g (b.w.), via gavage, for at least 15 days prior to mating and throughout the gestational period. The Pre-treatment group received the BVHME, via gavage, at a dose of 50 mg/kg (b.w.) for at least 15 days prior to mating and up to the appearance of the vaginal plug. The Organogenesis group received the BVHME at a dose of 50 mg/kg (b.w.), via gavage, on the 5-15th gestational day. The Gestational group received the BVHME at a dose of 50 mg/kg (b.w.), via gavage, throughout the gestational period (from the 1st to the 18th day of pregnancy). The Pre+Gestational group received the BVHME at a dose of 50 mg/kg (b.w.), via gavage, for at least 15 days prior to mating and up to throughout the gestational period. The clinical signals of maternal and fetuses toxicity were evaluated, as the mutagenicity and immunomodulation tests were performed. Results and conclusions The present investigation shows, for the first time, that the use of Byrsonima verbascifolia extract in pregnant Swiss mice, did not alter the female reproductive function, mutagenicity or immunostimulation as well as not interfere with embryofetal development at least in our experimental conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate antenatal care in reducing the vertical transmission of syphilis. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed to be representative of lowrisk pregnancies in women cared for at the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) network in the city of Rio de Janeiro, from November 2007 to July 2008. Pregnant women diagnosed with syphilis were identifi ed through interviews, checking their antenatal care card and searching for reported cases in the public health information systems. Cases of congenital syphilis were sought at the disease reporting system (Sinam), the Mortality Information System (SIM) and the SUS's Hospital Information System (SIH). RESULTS: Syphilis was identifi ed in 46 of the pregnancies, and 16 cases of congenital syphilis were identifi ed, resulting in a prevalence of 1.9% (95%CI 1.3;2.6) of syphilis in pregnancy and an incidence of 6/1,000 (95%CI 3;12/1,000) of congenital syphilis. The vertical transmission rate was 34.8% with three cases resulting in death (1 abortion, 1 stillborn and 1 neonatal death) and high proportions of prematurity and low birth weight. The healthcare pathway of those women revealed fl aws in the care they received, such as late entry to antenatal care, syphilis remaining undiagnosed during pregnancy and lack of treatment for the partner. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative strategies are needed to improve the outcomes of syphilis in pregnancy, including improving the laboratory network, the quality of care delivered to the pregnant women and their sexual partners and, most important of all, investigating every case of congenital syphilis as a sentinel event in the quality of antenatal care.

N2  - Prenatal care consists of practices considered to be effective for the reduction of adverse perinatal outcomes. However, studies have demonstrated inequities in pregnant women's access to prenatal care, with worse outcomes among those with lower socioeconomic status. The objective of this study is to evaluate access to and utilization of prenatal services in the Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS - Unified Health System) in the city of Rio de Janeiro and to verify its association with the characteristics of pregnant women and health services. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2007-2008, using interviews and the analysis of prenatal care cards of 2.353 pregnant women attending low risk prenatal care services of the SUS. A descriptive analysis of the reasons mentioned by women for the late start of prenatal care and hierarchical logistic regression for the identification of the factors associated with prenatal care use were performed. The absence of a diagnosis of pregnancy and poor access to services were the reasons most often reported for the late start of prenatal care. Earlier access was found among white pregnant women, who had a higher level of education, were primiparous and lived with a partner. The late start of prenatal care was the factor most associated with the inadequate number of consultations, also observed in pregnant adolescents. Black women had a lower level of adequacy of tests performed as well as a lower overall adequacy of prenatal care, considering the Programa de Humanização do Pré-Natal e Nascimento (PHPN - Prenatal and Delivery Humanization Program) recommendations. Strategies for the identification of pregnant women at a higher reproductive risk, reduction in organizational barriers to services and increase in access to family planning and early diagnosis of pregnancy should be prioritized.

N2  - Background: Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy is an inflammatory disease that occurs in approximately 30% of patients infected by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, and it has a profile of high morbidity and mortality. The worst prognosis and the progression of this cardiomyopathy are associated with an exacerbated immune response and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which also occur in other cardiomyopathies. Some nutrients, including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), promote the inhibition and/or stimulation of cytokine production. The objective of this trial is to study the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on the inflammatory response and lipid profile in patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy.Methods/Design: This is a parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial with 40 patients that will be conducted at a reference unit for Chagas disease patients, where the patients will be selected. The study will include patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy who are 18 years of age or older. The exclusion criteria are (a) ongoing diarrheal disease, (b) inflammatory bowel disease, (c) diabetes or other endocrine disease, (d) use of fibrates, niacin, or statins, (e) use of anti-inflammatory drugs, (f) pregnant and lactating women, (g) use of vitamin, mineral, or omega-3 supplementation during the previous 30 days, (h) hospital admission during the study, and (i) other associated cardiomyopathies. The intervention will be treatment with omega-3 PUFAs at a dose of 3 g/day for 8 weeks, compared to placebo (corn oil). The primary endpoints will be the concentrations of inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, interferon (IFN)γ, and transforming growth factor (TGF)β). Secondary endpoints will be the fasting glucose, lipid, and anthropometric profiles. For statistical analysis, we plan to run either a t test or Wilcoxon test (numerical variables) and Pearson's χ2 or Fisher's exact test (categorical data), as appropriate.Discussion: Evidence suggests that the anti-inflammatory action of omega-3 PUFAs may have beneficial effects on chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, as shown for other cardiomyopathies, due to improved control of the inflammatory response. At the end of the study, we predict that patients will have lower inflammatory markers and an improved metabolic and anthropometric profile.

N2  - The objective of this study was to describe the main factors related to the installation and/or aggravation of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and its clinical consequences in pregnant women after bariatric surgery. An electronic search on VDD in pregnancy and after bariatric surgery was conducted in publications from 1998 until 2012 that presented studies performed in humans. We provided an overview of VDD after bariatric surgery, in pregnancy, and in pregnancy in women who underwent bariatric surgery. In view of the high percentage of VDD postoperatively and the role of this vitamin in pregnancy, we recommend the investigation of vitamin D nutritional status in prenatal care. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - Introduction: The association between leprosy and pregnancy is currently poorly understood and has been linked to serious clinical consequences. Methods: A retrospective study between 2007 and 2009 was performed in the integration region of Carajás, Brazil on a population of pregnant lepers, with non-lepers of ages 12-49 years serving as the reference population. Results: Twenty-nine pregnant lepers were studied during the study period. The detection rates (DRs) for the studied association were 4.7 in 2007, 9.4 in 2008, and 4.3 in 2009. Conclusions: The Carajás region presented a medium pattern of endemicity during most of the study period, with a high DR found in 2008.

N2  - Background & aims: The occurrence of infectious disease processes during pregnancy has significant effects on maternal health and can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. The aim of the present study was to examine the potential role of zinc treatment during Trypanosoma cruzi infection in pregnant animals. Methods: Female Wistar rats weighing 180-200g were used in all experiments. Production of nitric oxide, peritoneal macrophages counts, and concentrations of IFN-γ and TNF-α were measured, and the potential protective effects of zinc on fetal development were assessed at 14-day post-infection. Results: Nitric oxide concentrations were higher in pregnant zinc-treated animals than in their untreated counterparts, despite similar levels of the macrophages, IFN-γ and TNF-α. Zinc therapy was associated with a significant reduction in parasitemia and cardiac parasite burden. Higher placental and birth weights were observed in animals given prenatal zinc supplementation compared to untreated animals. Conclusions: These data confirm the critical importance of adequate zinc intake during the peri-conceptional period and indicate that zinc has an effective role in preventing adverse outcomes of pregnancy and reducing the risk of common infections such as Chagas' disease. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

N2  - The study's objective was to estimate the effect of adherence to dietary recommendations by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) concerning energy intake and/or macronutrient composition of diet on weight during pregnancy. This was a prospective study with observations at three time points, with a sample of 255 pregnant women. The dependent variable was gestational weight, and the independent variable was dietary adequacy according to IOM recommendations for energy and macronutrient intake, categorized as adequate versus excessive intake. Statistical analyses were performed using mixed effects models for repeated measures. Pregnant women with excessive intake were 3.59kg lighter at baseline (SE = 0.92kg; p < 0.01). On average, gestational weight varied by 1.83kg (SE = 0.40kg) per trimester, but pregnant women with excessive intake showed a higher weight increase of 1.70kg (SE = 0.43kg) during the same period as compared to women with adequate intake (p < 0.01). Women who adhered to IOM dietary recommendations gained less weight during pregnancy.

N2  - Background: Information on vaccine-type HPV seroprevalence is essential for vaccine strategies; however, limited data are available on past exposure to HPV-quadrivalent vaccine types in HIV-infected woman in Brazil. Objectives: To assess the seroprevalence for HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 in HIV-infected and uninfected women, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and to investigate potential associations with age and pregnancy status. Study-design: 1100-sera were tested by virus-like particle (VLPs)-based ELISA for antibodies to HPV types 16, 18, 6 and 11. Statistical analysis was carried out by STATA/SE 10.1 and comparisons among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women were assessed by Poisson regression models with robust variance. Results: HPV-6, 11, 16 and 18 seroprevalence was significantly higher among HIV-positive women (29.9%, 8.5%, 56.2% and 38.0%, respectively) compared to HIV-negative women (10.9%, 3.5%, 30.8% and 21.7%, respectively), when adjusted by age and pregnancy status. Overall, 69.4% of HIV-infected and 41.5% of HIV-uninfected women tested positive for any HPV quadrivalent vaccine type. However 4.7% and 1.1%, respectively, tested positive for all HPV vaccine type. In HIV-uninfected women who were pregnant, we found a higher HPV-11 seroprevalence (8.5% vs. 1.5%; P<0.001) and a lower HPV 16 seroprevalence (22.6% vs. 34.2%; P=0.010) compared to not pregnant women. HIV-uninfected women, aged 40 or more years old had a higher HPV 16 seroprevalence compared to women aged less than 40 years old. Conclusions: We did not observe a strong association between age and positive HPV antibodies nor an association between pregnancy and HPV seroprevalence. HPV seroprevalence was significantly higher among HIV-infected women compared to HIV negative women. In both populations the seroprevalence to all four HPV vaccine types was low suggesting that women may potentially benefit from the HPV vaccines. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Brief Description of the Purpose of the Report: The ductus venosus is a venous conduit that exists during the embryonic period which conects the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava, permitting a large amount of oxygenated blood to reach central circulation. The agenesis of the ductus venosus is a rare vascular anomaly which can have hemodynamic consequences to the fetal development. Medical History: The patient, a second trimester pregnant woman, had a routine ultrasound examination, where an intra-abdominal umbilical vein with an extrahepatic detour was visualized, flowing directly to the right atrium. Diagnosis: The ultrasound, combined with Doppler, can trace signs of fetal circulatory alterations, which will be better studied and defined by Doppler. In this case, a cardiomegaly was found. Discussion and Summary of the Case: The monitoring of the course of the intra-abdominal umbilical vein can diagnose important circulatory alterations. In this case, the fetus evolved naturally, having no significant negative repercussions in the nursery.

N2  - Transmission of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains has been gaining attention and is becoming a growing problem throughout the world. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) among antiretroviral (ARV)-naive HIV-infected pregnant women in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ARV-naive pregnant women were recruited at Hospital Geral de Nova Iguacu (HGNI), Rio de Janeiro, from 2005 to 2008. HIV genotyping was carried out using ViroSeq (Abbott v. 2.0). TDRM were detected using the Calibrated Population Resistance Tool-CPR v. 6.0.The prevalence of mutations associated with resistance in the protease and reverse transcriptase regions of the HIV genome were assessed in samples collected prior to initiation of ARV prophylaxis or treatment. Among 238 eligible specimens that were collected, 197 samples were successfully amplified using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Eighty-one percent of women were infected with HIV subtype B, 10% with subtype F1 viruses, 1.0% with subtype C virus, and 8.0% with recombinant forms of the virus. The prevalence of HIV TDRM was 5.6% for nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 2.0% for nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and 3.0% for protease inhibitors. The overall prevalence of any drug resistance was 10.7%. There were no multiclass resistant strains identified in the analyzed samples. The prevalence of HIV TDRM among the pregnant women in our cohort was moderate. Resistance testing should be encouraged in Rio de Janeiro, among other locations, for all HIV-infected pregnant women prior to prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. © Copyright 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.

N2  - The molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Brazil is complex and heterogeneous because several subtypes co-circulate with some important regional differences. This study evaluated HIV-1 subtypes amongst pregnant women living in the metropolitan area and in the interior cities from central western Brazil. From June 2008 to June 2010, 86.9% of confirmed cases of HIV-1 infection amongst pregnant women (172 out of 198 cases) were recruited in Goiania/Goias state. The HIV-1 pol gene was sequenced after nested-PCR. HIV-1 subtypes were assigned by REGA, phylogenetic, and bootscan analyses. The median age of participants was 26 years (15-41 years range); 58.7% of participants were diagnosed during prenatal care and 51.7% of participants came from >50 interior cities within Goias state. Amongst the 131 HIV-1 pol sequences, 64.9% were subtype B, 13.0% were BF1 recombinant, 11.4% were subtype C, 7.6% were subtype F1, and 2.3% were BC recombinant. According to the HIV-1 diagnosis date (1994-2010), a significant increase in subtype C and a decrease of BF1 mosaics were observed over time. All subtype C patients lived in interior cities where the highest prevalence of subtype C outside southern Brazil was observed (18.4%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple independent introductions of the Brazilian subtype C clade from the southern/southeastern regions of Brazil. The HIV-1 epidemic in women from central western Brazil infected by the heterosexual route is characterized by an unexpectedly high prevalence of subtype C viruses highly related to those circulating in southern/southeastern Brazil. These findings highlight the importance of molecular surveillance programs outside large metropolitan regions in Brazil. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine the agreement between maternal perception of fetal movements and the movements recorded simultaneously by ultrasound in low-risk pregnancies. METHODS: Twenty pregnant women were evaluated with the following inclusion criteria: single pregnancy, alive fetus, maternal age between 18 and 35 years; between 36 and 40 weeks gestation; normal fetal morphology at ultrasound, and absence of maternal comorbidities. The pregnant women were evaluated for 10 minutes, during which cardiotocography was used to record fetal movements triggered with the event marker, with the paper speed set at 3 cm/min. At the same time, fetal movements were observed by ultrasonography. RESULTS: The kappa index for interobserver agreement analysis was 0.62, showing good agreement (95%CI 0.45-0.79). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.82 (95%CI 0.61-0.92). Analysis by the Bland & Altman graph indicated good agreement. A linear regression analysis showed a significant correlation between maternal perception (x) and ultrasound (y) observation (r 2=0.71, p<0.001; equation: y=5.31+0.66x). CONCLUSIONS: The agreement between ultrasound and maternal perception of fetal movement is good, allowing the use of fetal movement counting in the assessment of fetal wellbeing.

N2  - This study aims to describe the clinical consequences of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) in pregnant women after bariatric surgery. Included are studies on VAD during pregnancy and after bariatric surgery conducted in humans from 1993 to 2011. There are few investigations on the relationship between pregnancy and bariatric surgery and on the damage to the binomial mother-child resulting from VAD in this relationship. The high percentage of VAD in the postoperative period is a cause for concern, especially considering the function of this vitamin in certain biological moments and in moments of intense nutritional demand. This vitamin serum evaluation is recommended during the prenatal period. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - This study evaluates the incidence of congenital syphilis in the Brazilian state of Ceará from 2000 to 2009, describes the epidemiologic profile of pregnant women whose newborns had congenital syphilis and verifies the receipt of prenatal care and treatment of their partners. It is a retrospective study that was conducted in July 2010 using a Center for Information and Analysis in Health database that contains information on National Notifiable Diseases. There were 2,930 reported cases of congenital syphilis, demonstrating an annual ascending historical series. The majority of the pregnant women were 20 to 34 years of age (n=1,836, 62.7%), illiterate or with little education (n=1623, 55.4%) and had received prenatal care (n=2077, 70.9%). The inadequate treatment of women and the lack of treatment for their partners is a reality in Ceará. The incidence of congenital syphilis is a quality indicator of prenatal care. Therefore, its increase in the last ten years highlights the necessity of syphilis control.

N2  - A nutritional protein deficit would induce modifications in fetal development, parasitemia and congenital Chagas transmission, while arginine intake would improve this situation. Female mice (C3H strain) were feeded with hypoproteic (H), and normoproteic (N) diets during a month, some of them were provided also with 0.1% of arginine (Arg). They were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes and were sacrificed at 14th day of gestation. Itwas evaluated maternal parasitemia, embryos and absorptions quantity; embryos and placentae size, and uterine horns weight. The H diet increased infection effects, affecting fetal development and maternal parasitemia. Arg improved protective effects, with fetal size increment, reduced embryo absorptions and maternal parasitemia. The high incidence of pregnant women affected with Chagas disease are related to deficient diets that would affect fetal development, and would be associated with susceptibility to congenital transmission. The Arg supplementation improve fetal development in the acute phase of Chagas infection, possible due to the nourishment increment including sources for nitric oxide production.

N2  - Congenital Chagas transmission, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is low and the complete placental barrier limits the placental infection. Due it has been described discontinuities in the placental barrier, the first objective was to analyze the susceptibility of placental barrier to infection by T. cruzi employing monolayers of cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast (STB), and trypsin denuded chorionic villi (without STB). These results support that the complete placental barrier and specifically STB limits the infection of chorionic villi by T. cruzi via NO production, which was modified by Larginine. Thus, the diet consumed by pregnant women might modify the vertical transmission. To test this, infection of pregnant C3H mice reduced the number of fetuses and the hipoproteic-normocaloric diet increased parasitemia, uterine inflammation and reduced placenta and fetus weights. These results establish there was a deleterious placental environment to T. cruzi and that discontinuities in the placental barrier and/or aminoacids or protein deficiency intake facilitate the placental infection or unimproved the fetal outcome leading to congenital Chagas disease.

N2  - Background: Dengue is a reportable disease in Brazil; however, pregnancy has been included in the application form of the Brazilian notification information system only after 2006. To estimate the severity of maternal dengue infection, the available data that were compiled from January 2007 to December 2008 by the official surveillance information system of the city of Rio de Janeiro were reviewed. Methods and Principal Findings: During the study period, 151,604 cases of suspected dengue infection were reported. Five hundred sixty-one women in their reproductive age (15-49 years) presented with dengue infection; 99 (18.1%) pregnant and 447 (81.9%) non-pregnant women were analyzed. Dengue cases were categorized using the 1997 WHO classification system, and DHF/DSS were considered severe disease. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare maternal age, according to gestational period, and severity of disease. A chi-square test was utilized to evaluate the differences in the proportion of dengue severity between pregnant and non-pregnant women. Univariate analysis was performed to compare outcome variables (severe dengue and non-severe dengue) and explanatory variables (pregnancy, gestational age and trimester) using the Wald test. A multivariate analysis was performed to assess the independence of statistically significant variables in the univariate analysis. A p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. A higher percentage of severe dengue infection among pregnant women was found, p = 0.0001. Final analysis demonstrated that pregnant women are 3.4 times more prone to developing severe dengue (OR: 3.38; CI: 2.10-5.42). Mortality among pregnant women was superior to non-pregnant women. Conclusion: Pregnant women have an increased risk of developing severe dengue infection and dying of dengue. © 2013 Machado et al.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiological characteristics of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected mothers and the live birth conditions of neonates. Methods: A serological survey with IgG-specific tests was conducted using dried blood samples from newborn infants in the State of Minas Gerais. T. cruzi infection was confirmed in mothers through positive serology in two different tests, and infected mothers were required to have their infants serologically tested after the age of 6 months. The birth conditions of the neonates were obtained from the System of Information on Live Births database. Results: The study included 407 children born to T. cruzi-infected mothers and 407 children born to uninfected mothers. The average age of seropositive mothers was 32 years (CI95% 31.3-32.6), which was greater than the average age of seronegative mothers - 25 years (CI95% 24.8-25.2). The mothers' level of education was higher among uninfected mothers (41% had 8 or more years of education, versus 22% between the infected mothers). Vaginal delivery was more frequent among infected mothers. There was no evidence of inter-group differences with respect to the child's sex, gestational age, birth weight or Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity and respiration (APGAR) scores at 1 and 5 minutes. Conclusions: The level of education and the greater number of previous pregnancies and cases of vaginal delivery reflect the lower socioeconomical conditions of the infected mothers. In the absence of vertical transmission, neonates had similar health status irrespective of the infection status of their mothers.

N2  - Background: A randomised, unblinded, clinical trial comparing two benznidazole regimens for congenital Chagas disease was carried out to determine whether simplification and reduction in the length of treatment could lead to better treatment compliance. Methods: This study was conducted in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Serological screening was carried out in pregnant women, and parasites were sought in the blood of newborns from seropositive mothers. Infected infants were randomly assigned to two treatment groups. Recovery was assessed by parasite seeking at 1 month and 2 months as well as serological tests at 9 months. Assessment of treatment adherence was based on weekly home visits and use of electronic monitors. Results: Benznidazole was given to 63 newborns in group A (5 mg/kg in two daily doses for 60 days) and 61 newborns in group B (7.5 mg/kg in a single daily dose for 30 days). There was no difference in compliance between the two groups. The study confirmed the efficacy and good tolerance of both benznidazole regimens in the treatment of congenital Chagas disease. Conclusions: The short treatment should be preferred as it allows reducing the dose of benznidazole as well as the cost of treatment. © Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 2012.

N2  - Objective: To study Trypanosoma cruzi infection and transplacental transmission in pregnant women in Moniquira and Miraflores in Boyacá, Colombia. Material and Methods: Screening of 862 mothers (600 to 950) in both municipalities, reaching a total of 702 participants from whom 659 samples were processed (358 from Moniquira and 301 from Miraflores). This screening used Elisa techniques with filter paper, and the positives were confirmed with ELISA in serum, IIF, blood cultures and PCR. Results: The current prevalence of Chagas disease in mothers is 3.34% (22/659), 3.99% (12/301) in Miraflores and 2.79% (10/358) in Moniquira. Of the 22 mothers who were followed, data was obtained from 18 of their newborns, 6 of whom had positive blood culture tests. Blood cultures were considered the confirmatory technique for parasitemia in newborns before 8 months; therefore, the overall transplacental incidence was 27.27% positive newborns per year (6/22). After following-up at the homes and peridomiciles, searching for triatominae and fumigating the homes, we began treatment for the newborns with benznidazole at a rate of 5-8 mg/kg/day for 60 days. Conclusions: The prevalence rate found in mothers was greater than the prevalence rates reported for Chile and Brazil but lower than those for Bolivia, Argentina and Uruguay. The transplacental incidence found after 1 year of follow-up was similar to that reported in Chile (16%-28%) and higher than those of Brazil (1%), Uruguay (0.5%-3%), Bolivia (7%) and Paraguay (7%). © 2013 ACIN.

N2  - Objective: To describe Group B Streptococcus (GBS) prevention policies at 12 Latin American sites participating in the NICHD (Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development) International Site Development Initiative (NISDI) Longitudinal Study in Latin American Countries (LILAC) and to determine rates of rectovaginal colonization and GBS-related disease among HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants. Methods: Site surveys were used to assess prevention policies and practices administered cross-sectionally during 2010. Data collected in NISDI from 2008 to 2010 regarding HIV-infected pregnant women were used to determine rates of colonization and GBS-related disease. Results: Of the 9 sites with a GBS prevention policy, 7 performed routine rectovaginal screening for GBS. Of the 401 women included in the NISDI study, 56.9% were at sites that screened. The GBS colonization rate was 8.3% (19/228 women; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.1%-12.7%). Disease related to GBS occurred in 0.5% of the participants (2/401 women; 95% CI, 0.1%-1.8%); however, no GBS-related disease was reported among the 398 infants (95% CI, 0.0%-0.9%). Conclusion: Improved efforts to implement prevention policies and continued surveillance for GBS are needed to understand the impact of GBS among HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants in Latin America. © 2012 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

N2  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The role of Azadirachta indica (neem) against Chagas disease and its antibiotic and antidiabetic action have been demonstrated in non-pregnant animals. However, the effects of neem on lipid metabolism and oxidative stress during pregnancy remain to be investigated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Azadirachta indica (neem) on maternal reproductive performance and biochemical parameters in non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced mild diabetic rats (MD). Materials and methods: Pregnant rats were randomly distributed into six experimental groups: ND=non-treated non-diabetic (n=13); NDOil=non-diabetic treated with 1.2 mL/day neem seed oil (n=12); NDPA=non-diabetic treated with 1.0 mg/mL/day azadirachtin (n=12); D=non-treated diabetic (n=13); DOil: diabetic treated with neem seed oil (n=12), and DPA=diabetic treated with azadirachtin, n=13. Treatment with either neem oil (1.2 mL/day) or azadirachtin (1.0 mg/mL/day) was orally administered throughout pregnancy. Glucose test tolerance (GTT) was performed at day 17 of pregnancy and used as an inclusion criterion. At term pregnancy, maternal reproductive outcomes, lipid profile and oxidative stress status were assessed. Results: Treatment with neem oil and azadirachtin during pregnancy (1) had no hypoglycemic and anti-hyperglycemic effects on non-diabetic and diabetic rats, respectively; (2) affected OGTT glycemic levels in diabetic rats; (3) increased the proportion of fetuses classified as small for pregnancy age (SPA) in all groups; and (4) did not interfere with the lipid profile in non-diabetic dams. Neem oil reduced the rate of total cholesterol and NEFA in diabetic animals. Both neem oil and azadirachtin increased lipoperoxidation, characterized by increased MDA levels in non-diabetic rats. Conclusion: Both neem seed oil and azadirachtin impaired intrauterine development and altered antioxidant/oxidative status during pregnancy. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objectives: In Brazil the maternal mortality rate is still high, but with a reduction of maternal deaths in the last decades, the study of cases of women who nearly died, because they are more prevalent, has been increasingly used to assess obstetric care. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of maternal near miss (MNM) in Brazil and the factors associated with its occurrence. Materials: This is a nationwide cohort study of mothers and babies followed up to 45 to 60 days after delivery. The sample was stratified by macro regions, type of city and hospital. Two electronic forms were applied to the mothers. The first form in the hospital after delivery and the second during a phone interview. There were also two other questionnaires, one used to evaluate data from medical records and another for the structure of hospitals. For the identification of MNM cases we used data collected from maternal medical records and the hospital form. Methods: To assess factors associated with MNM were used Chi Square tests with interval confidence of 5%. Results: The analysis of 20,321 mothers who had vaginal delivery or cesarean section, identified 431 cases of MNM with a prevalence of 2.1%. Prevalence was higher in public (2.3%) than in private hospitals (1.2%). Among women 35 years or older the prevalence of MNM was 3.0% while in those with age 19 or less was 1.8%. The prevalence of MNM according to race and parity showed no significant differences. The vast majority of women (98%) had prenatal care but 17.9% had less than 6 consults. Comparing women who didn't had MNM with those who had MNM it was statistically significant being considered a high risk pregnant women (15.9% vs. 26.9%), had hypertension (14.0% vs. 23.7%), had been hospitalized during pregnancy (13.8% vs. 17.4%) and had a forceps delivery (0.7% vs. 1.7%). Among women with MNM the most frequent diagnoses were cyanosis (12.8%), coagulation disorders (4.9%) and respiratory failure (3.7%). The most prevalent laboratory findings were thrombocytopenia (10.4%), pH <7.0 and bilirubin >6 (9.0%). The most used treatments in women with MNM were blood transfusion >5 units (15.5%), vasoactive drugs (14.8%) and puerperal hysterectomy (11.7%). Conclusions: The incidence of MNM was similar to that found in other studies in Brazil. The higher prevalence of MNM among women users of public health services evidences the importance of qualification of obstetric care in these units to reduce maternal mortality.

N2  - Objectives: Inadequate weight gain during pregnancy has demonstrated to be predictive of complications for both mother and fetus. The objective of this study was to evaluate factors associated with inadequate weight gain among women in the third trimester of pregnancy. Materials: This work is a subproject of a cross-sectional study that assessed the quality of prenatal care among pregnant women assisted by the Unified Health System (SUS) units, from 2007 to 2008 in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The sample for this study consisted of 1,079 pregnant women. Methods: The adequacy of their weight gain (outcome variable) was obtained by calculating the amount of weight gain recommended by the Institute of Medicine (2009). Sociodemographic and obstetric care factors were analyzed as independent variables. A multinomial logistic regression model was used, in which pregnant women with weight gain above or below recommendation were compared to those with adequate weight gain. The criterion for the permanence of variables in the final model was a 5% statistical significance. Analyses were carried out with the SPSS16.0 software. Results: Data obtained revealed that pregnant women with a lower education level (<7 years at school) are less likely (OR = 0.48, CI 0.33-0.70) to have insufficient weight gain. On the other hand, the greatest likelihood of excessive weight gain was observed among women diagnosed with high blood pressure (OR = 1.88, CI 0.98- 3.61). It was also noticed that there is a growing trend for excessive weight gain in all categories of pre-pregnancy nutritional condition, in which OR values of 1.88 (underweight), 4.06 (overweight) and 5.86 (obesity) - statistically significant - were found. Conclusions: The different determinants of insufficient and excessive weight gain found in this study are easily identifiable in early gestation and are potential predictors of unfavorable outcomes for the pregnancy. The trend in relation to excessive weight gain is a concern due to its implications for pregnancy outcomes, considering both woman and baby. It is essential to study this topic further in order to propose effective improvements in the quality of care provided to pregnant women, and encourage much needed debates to make sure that the recommendations currently adopted are indeed the best guidance for these women.

N2  - To analyze the sociodemographic and behavioral profile of sex partners, the proportion of those inadequately treated as well as to verify how many of them were inadequately treated and why some were not treated. METHODS: Quantitative study with data collected from May to October, 2008 at five public maternities in Fortaleza, Ceará. A survey was carried out with parturients who were hospitalized with syphilis and had a stable sex partner. We analyzed sociodemographic variables and those related to communication, diagnosis and treatment of sex partners. The data were entered into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences and were analyzed using frequency distributions, measures of central tendency and dispersion. RESULTS: The study included 56 pregnant women. Most sexual partners were young adults aged on average 29 years, 50% of them had studied for less than seven years, 82.1 worked and 46.4% had a family income of less than a minimum wage. Of all the partners, 92.9% were the child's father and 69.6% lived with the women. Fifty percent and 12% were alcohol and drug users, respectively. Most partners (75.0%) were told about the diagnosis by the women, and in 78.6% of cases they were aware of the VDRL result before or during the prenatal period. However, 25.0% of the women did not communicate the result to their partners for the following reasons: not knowing the importance of the partner's treatment (50.0%), not being together after the diagnosis (42.9%) and having a quarrel (7.1%). Of the partners who were informed about the result before or during the prenatal period, 56.0% were treated and six (42.8%) were considered to have been properly treated. Among the ones who did not receive treatment, 63.6% refused it because they did not feel sick, because they did not believe in the treatment and because they were afraid of injections. CONCLUSIONS: Partners are told about the syphilis diagnosis of the pregnant women; however, only a few are properly treated.

N2  - Zidovudine (3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine; AZT) is a nucleoside analogue widely used for the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Medical guidelines recommend the use of AZT by pregnant women in order to reduce risk of HIV vertical transmission. Although it is efficacious, little is known about the side effects of AZT on embryonic development. In this sense, we used murine embryonic stem (mES) cells as a model to investigate the consequences of AZT exposure for embryogenesis. Firstly, mES colonies were incubated with AZT (50 or 100 mM) and cell cycle profile was evaluated. While 27.7 ± 5.43% of untreated mES cells were in G2/M phase, this percentage raised to 45.96 ± 4.18% after AZT exposure (100 μM). To identify whether accumulation of cells in G2/M phase could be related to chromosome missegregation with consequent cell cycle arrest, aneuploidy rate was evaluated after AZT treatment. Untreated colonies presented 39.6 ± 8.4% of cells aneuploid, while after AZT 100 μM treatment, the proportion of aneuploid cells raised to 67.8 ± 3.4% with prevalence of chromosome loss. This event was accompanied by micronuclei formation as AZT 100 μM treated mES cells presented a 2-fold increase compared to untreated ones. These data suggest that AZT exerts genotoxic effects and increases chromosome instability at early stages of embryonic development. © The Author 2012.

N2  - Introduction: In Brazil, studies have shown that HTLV seroprevalence among pregnant women varies from 0 to 1.8%. However, this seroprevalence was unknown in the State of Pará, Brazil. The present study describes, for the first time, the HTLV seroprevalence among pregnant women from the State of Pará, Northern Brazil. Methods: 13,382 pregnant women were submitted to HTLV screening during prenatal care, and those with non-seronegative results to anti-HTLV were submitted to Western blot (WB) test to confirm and separate HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 carriers. Results: HTLV seroprevalence in the population of pregnant women was 0.3%, and HTLV-1 was identified in 95.3% of patients. The demographic profile of HTLV carriers was as follows: women with age between 20 and 40 years old (78.4%); residing in the metropolitan region of Belém, Pará (67.6%); and with educational level of high school (56.8%). Other variables related to infection were as follows: beginning of sexual intercourse between the age of 12 and 18 years old (64.9%) and have being breastfed for more than 6 months (51.4%). Most of the women studied had at least two previous pregnancies (35.1%) and no abortion (70.3%). Coinfections (syphilis and HIV) were found in 10.8% (4/37) of these pregnant women. Conclusions: Seroprevalence of HTLV infection in pregnant women assisted in basic health units from the State of Pará, Northern Brazil, was 0.3% similar to those described in other Brazilian studies. The variables related to infection were important indicators in identifying pregnant women with a higher tendency to HTLV seropositivity, being a strategy for disease control and prevention, avoiding vertical transmission.

N2  - Objective: The three main transmission routes of Trypanosoma cruzi in non-endemic regions are transfusion of blood products, organ transplantation and vertical transmission from a seropositive mother to her child during pregnancy or delivery. In Navarra (Spain) with 630 578 inhabitants it is estimated that there are 11.2% immigrants (42% from Chagas endemic areas). There isn't regulation for screening of pregnant women. In March 2011 the Microbiology laboratory established three methods for the diagnosis of Chagas disease and we began a systematic screening of pregnant women from endemic areas, of newborns from infected pregnant women and the other children from these women. The aim of this study is to review the results of the first 8 months of this program. Methods: The study was carried out at the Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, the reference hospital in the region of Navarra (Spain). The microbiology laboratory has established Chemiluminescence (Abbott), IFA (Vircell, Granada, Spain) and PCR (Ingenie molecular, Valencia Spain) for diagnosis of Chagas disease. The pregnant women from endemic countries are studied ant they are diagnosed of T. cruzi infection if CLIA and IFA are positives. PCR is carried out for diagnosis of children born from infected mothers. Other patients also have been studied: children from infected mothers, and adults with cardiac or digestive symptoms. Results: One hundred and sixty-eight sera have been studied. Twentytwo out of them have been positives corresponding to 17 patients. One hundred and thirty-four sera were from pregnant women and there nine positives among them (6.71%), seven women were born in Bolivia, one was from Ecuador and the other one was from Brazil. There were also two children one of them had a congenital Chagas disease who's mother was born in Ecuador an the other one was a 9 years old boy from Bolivia. The remaining six cases were adults from Bolivia (five women, one man), two out of them had digestive symptoms and one of them had cardiac disease. Conclusion: The WHO report from 2009 that take into account the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in Latin America suggest that between 40 000 and 65 000 affected people currently reside in Spain and only 3600 have been diagnosed. There is a need of easy accession to laboratory diagnosis. The detection of Chagas disease relies on the initiative of health care workers. Our experience has been positive with 17 new cases diagnosed in the first 8 months after implementation of ELISA, IFA and PCR at the microbiology laboratory.

N2  - The persistence of negative perinatal outcomes in Rio de Janeiro suggests problems in the quality of prenatal care. The most recent study in the city showed that only 38% of prenatal care was adequate. This study aimed to evaluate the adequacy of prenatal care under the Brazilian Unified National Health System in the city of Rio de Janeiro. A cross-sectional study in 2007-2008 interviewed2,422 women receiving prenatal care for low-risk pregnancy. Evaluation of care used the PHPN index, based on guidelines from the Program for Humanization of Prenatal Care and Childbirth (Brazilian Ministry of Health) and an expanded PHPN index, which included clinical-obstetric procedures, prescription of supplementary ferrous sulfate, and educational activities. According to the PHPN index, 38.5% of prenatal care was adequate, as compared to 33.3% based on the expanded PHPN index. Strategies to expand early entry of pregnant women into prenatal care and better use of their contact with the health services in order to promote healthcare measures are essential to correct this situation.

N2  - Viral load (VL) near delivery is a determinant of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV. To evaluate factors associated with an undetectable VL near delivery in HIV-infected pregnant women receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and non-HAART regimens, HIV-infected pregnant women with a detectable VL at entry and having used antiretrovirals for ≥ 4 weeks before delivery were selected. Multivariate analysis was employed using binary logistic unconditional models; the dependent variable was having a VL, 400 copies/mL near delivery. VL suppression was achieved in 403/707 women (57%): 65.4% in the HAART group, but only 26% in the non-HAART group P 1/4 0.001. Duration of HAART was correlated with VL suppression, with maximum benefit seen after ≥ 12 weeks of therapy (odds ratio [OR]: 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.72-3.65). CD4{thorn} cell count near delivery (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.06-2.20) and baseline VL (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.58-0.94) were also independently associated with VL suppression. Overall MTCT rate was 1.6%. HAART for ≥ 12 weeks, baseline VL and CD4 cell count near delivery were independently associated with viral suppression near delivery.

N2  - American trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease (CD), discovered in 1909 by the Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, is a vector-borne complex disease caused by the haemoflagellate protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi [1]. One hundred years after its discovery, CD is still epidemiologically relevant, afflicting 12-14 million neglected individuals in 18 endemic countries in Latin America, as well as in non-endemic countries in North America, Europe, and Asia [2, 3]. In the last three decades, governmental initiatives targeting the main vector in endemic areas resulted in successful decline of the incidence of acute infection. For instance, in Brazil, the numbers of acute infection dropped from more than 100,000 new cases/year during the 1980s to less than 500 new cases/year during 2001-2006 [2, 4]. However, the current epidemiological data indicate that we must devote our efforts and agenda to the implementation of sustainable policies for CD control. These measures should incorporate guaranteeing access to the trypanocidal treatment and therapies required by patients, particularly pregnant women and children, developing new drugs and therapeutic strategies, identifying progression markers, as well as elucidating pathogenic mechanisms leading to the distinct clinical forms of CD [3, 4]. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - This study evaluated the association between adolescent pregnancy and the completion of basic education, mediated by macrosocial indicators. A cross-sectional household survey was conducted with individuals between the ages of 18 and 24 in three Brazilian cities. For the purposes of this study, individuals between the ages of 20 and 24 were selected from this sample survey that included 4,634 people. A total of 29.6% of the girls declared that they had become pregnant prior to reaching the age of 20, while 21.4% of the boys stated that they had made a girl pregnant in adolescence. Girls from households with a per capita family income of US$70 or less and who became pregnant at least once during adolescence were more likely to have not completed basic education; whereas from households with a per capita family income of US$70 or less, with parents who separated before the adolescent reached the age of 20 and that had made a partner pregnant prior reaching the age of 20 were more likely to have not completed basic education. It is vital that the school system provides girls and boys with guidance on sexuality and contraception and encourages them to remain in education.

N2  - The present study compared morphological, histochemical and histomorphometric characteristics of the sublethal effects of XenTari® and deltamethrin in blastocyst-endometrium interactions in female rats. Pregnant rats received 185, 1850 and 3700. mg of XenTari® or 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0. mg of deltamethrin (all doses per kg of body weight) and were sacrificed on the seventh day of pregnancy. The rats treated with the higher doses of insecticides exhibited a significant reduction in the number of implantation sites, vacuolated trophoblast cells, rare cytotrophoblasts, accentuated leukocyte infiltration, increase in vascularization of sites and blood in the uterine lumen. The decidua was more fibrous, particularly in the rats treated with the highest dose of XenTari®. In conclusion, sublethal doses of both XenTari® and deltamethrin produced qualitative/quantitative alterations in the blastocyst-endometrium interaction in female rats, thereby compromising the implantation process. Further studies are needed particularly at verifying the effects of these insecticides in the pregnancy to term in rats, order to investigate possible correlated effects on women working or living near agricultural fields. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of infectious morbidity in newborns. We describe the prevalence of GBS colonization and the serotypes and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of isolates obtained from a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected pregnant women. This was a cross-sectional study at a centre for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Vaginal and rectal swabs were collected at 3537 weeks of gestation from 158 eligible women. GBS isolates were serotyped and antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed. Patient sociodemographic characteristics, CD4 counts and viral loads were abstracted from records. The overall anogenital prevalence of GBS colonization was 49/158 (31.0%): 40/158 (25.3%) for vagina, 19/158 (12.0%) for rectum and 10/158 (6.3%) for both. Predominant serotypes were Ib (34.9%) and Ia (25.6%). All were penicillin-susceptible. Two were resistant to erythromycin (4.0%) and one to clindamycin (2.0%). The colonization rate by GBS was high in this cohort. Serotype Ib was the most frequently identified. © 2011 Informa Healthcare.

N2  - Micronutrient deficiency is an unquestionable public health problem, specially anemia and vitamin A deficiency (VAD). This is due to the collective dimension of these carencies, which reflects on morbimortality rates in the maternal and infant group. to evaluate the impact of a proposal for prenatal nutritional assistance, comparing the prevalence of anemia and VAD, in pre-intervention (GI) and intervention (GII) groups. this is a prospective intervention study in a cohort of pregnant women. The GI group was made up of 225 the GII group of 208 pregnant adults and their respective newborns, attended a Public Maternity Ward in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Concentration of hemoglobin was used to diagnose anemia and a standardized interview to diagnose night blindness (XN). after adjusting for confounding variables, through logistic regression, the protective effect of intervention at the onset of anemia (OR = 0.420; IC 95% = 0.251-0.702), with a significant reduction in prevalence, of 28.4% in the GI to 16.8% in the GII, also observed at the onset of XN (OR = 0.377; IC95% = 0.187- 0.759), with a reduction in prevalence of 18.7 % in the GI to 6.2% in the GII. Nutritional intervention has a beneficial effect on maternal health, reducing nutritional deficiencies most prevalent during pregnancy and the impact of these on the obstetric ailment.

N2  - Congenital toxoplasmosis is a potentially severe infection and its prevention is most often based on serological screening in pregnant women. Many cases could be prevented by simple precautions during pregnancy. Aiming to assess the knowledge about toxoplasmosis among professionals working in antenatal care in a high prevalent region, a questionnaire was administered to 118 obstetric nurses and physicians attending at primary care units and hospitals. The questionnaire was self-completed and included questions on diagnosis, clinical issues, and prevention. Only 44 of total answers were corrected. Lower scores were observed among those with over 10 years of graduation, working in primary care units, and nurses. Errors were mainly observed in questions of prevention and diagnosis. As congenital toxoplasmosis is a mother-to-child (MTC) transmitted disease, early diagnosis and treatment can prevent serious and irreversible fetal damage. Thus, doctors and nurses who provide prenatal care must be appropriately trained on prophylactic, diagnostic, and clinical aspects of toxoplasmosis. The authors suggest that measures should be taken for continuing education regarding toxoplasmosis in pregnancy. Copyright 2011 Laura Berriel da Silva et al.

The costs were calculated by means of the activity-based costing technique and the cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for each consequence. Data sources were information systems of the Ministry of Health and worksheets of costs provided by the Health Department of Recife and Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira. Healthcare units with implemented or partially implemented prenatal care were compared in terms of their cost-effectiveness and perinatal results. Results: In 64% of the units, prenatal care was implemented with a mean total cost of R$ 39,226.88 and variation of R$ 3,841,87 to R$ 8,765.02 per healthcare unit. In the units with partially implemented prenatal care (36%), the mean total cost was R$ 30,092.61 (R$ 4,272.12 to R$ 11,774.68). The mean cost per pregnant woman was R$ 196.13 with implemented prenatal care and R$ 150.46 with partially implemented prenatal care. A higher proportion of low birth weight, congenital syphilis, perinatal and fetal deaths was found in the partially implemented group. Conclusions: Prenatal care is cost-effective for several studied consequences. The adverse effects measured by the health indicators were lower in the units with implemented prenatal care. The mean cost in the partially implemented group was higher, which suggests a possible waste of resources, as the teams' productivity is insufficient for the installed capacity.

N2  - Methylmercury (MeHg) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant with known neurodevelopmental effects. In humans, prenatal exposures primarily occur through maternal consumption of contaminated fish. In this study, we evaluated the association between prenatal exposure to MeHg and titers of total immunoglobulins (Ig) and specific autoantibodies in both mothers and fetuses by analyzing maternal and cord blood serum samples. We examined multiple immunoglobulin isotypes to determine if these biomarkers could inform as to fetal or maternal responses since IgG but not IgM can cross the placenta. Finally, we evaluated serum cytokine levels to further characterize the immune response to mercury exposure.The study was conducted using a subset of serum samples (N=61 pairs) collected from individuals enrolled in a population surveillance of MeHg exposures in the Brazilian Amazon during 2000/2001. Serum titers of antinuclear and antinucleolar autoantibodies were measured by indirect immunofluorescence. Serum immunoglobulins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and BioPlex multiplex assay. Serum cytokines were measured by BioPlex multiplex assay.In this population, the geometric mean mercury level was within the 95th percentile for US populations of women of childbearing age but the upper level of the range was significantly higher. Fetal blood mercury levels were higher (1.35 times) than those in their mothers, but highly correlated (correlation coefficient [. r]=0.71; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.89). Total IgG (r=0.40; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.62) and antinuclear autoantibody (odds ratio [OR]=1.05; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.08) levels in paired maternal and fetal samples were also associated; in contrast, other immunoglobulin (IgM, IgE, and IgA) levels were not associated between pairs. Total IgG levels were significantly correlated with both maternal (r=0.60; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.96) and cord blood mercury levels (r=0.61; 95% CI: 0.25, 0.97), but individual isotypes were not. Serum cytokines, interleukin-1Β (r=0.37; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.73), interleukin-6 (r=0.34; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.65), and tumor necrosis factor-α (r=0.24; 95% CI: 0.015, 0.47), were positively correlated between maternal and fetal samples. Antinuclear and antinucleolar autoantibody titer and serum cytokine levels, in either maternal or cord blood, were not significantly associated with either maternal or cord blood mercury levels.These data provide further evidence that there are likely IgG biomarkers of mercury-induced immunotoxicity in this population since IgG levels were elevated with increased, and associated with, mercury exposure. However, unlike previous data from adult males and non-pregnant females, we found no evidence that antinuclear and antinucleolar autoantibody titer is a reliable biomarker of mercury immunotoxicity in this population. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - One hundred fifty-two Trypanosoma cruzi seropositive women were submitted to a single hemoculture; 101 were pregnant, and 51 were not pregnant. Seven tubes from each individual were harvested with liver infusion tryptose (LIT) medium and observed monthly until the fifth month. Hemocultures were positive in 50% (76 of 152) of the women. Results showed that the positivity was 29.4% (15 of 51) among non-pregnant women and 60.4% (61 of 101) in pregnant women ( P < 0.05). In relation to gestational age, there were significant differences in positivity, with a higher proportion of women with positive hemocultures (20 of 25) before 21 weeks and lower after 30 weeks (10 of 21; P = 0.02). We conclude that pregnancy enhances the parasitemia in Chagas disease, with a higher effect early in pregnancy. Copyright © 2011 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

N2  - Zinc is an essential micronutrient and has significant effects on human growth, development, and immune function. Zinc supplementation or deficiency may affect the course of infection. Zinc enhances immune response against a wide range of viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens. In the present study, we investigated the effects of zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) supplementation (20mg/kg/day) during pregnancy in mice, Swiss Webster strain infected by the Y strain of Trypanosoma cruzi. Oral supplementation of zinc sulphate in pregnant and non-pregnant infected animals did not affect the count of blood parasites as well as tissue parasitism in the heart, liver, and spleen. Zinc supplementation did not alter female body weight, the length of fetuses and neonates, placental size/weight and mortality rate. Among zinc supplied animals, no significant plasmatic zinc concentrations were observed. Concerning to tissue zinc concentrations, only the liver displayed enhanced values as compared to other organs. For placental parasitism, zinc supplied group displayed a significant decrease in amastigote burdens (P<0.05). However due to the reduced number of parasite burdens in placenta of animals supplied with zinc, these data suggest that zinc was partially effective in up-regulating the host's immune response against parasite, probably attenuating the infection in fetuses. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Fifeen female Swiss mice were mated and, afer pregnancy confrmation, placed in individual cages. A few hours afer birth, the females were inoculated with 0.1 mL of blood containing approximately 3 × 105 trypomastigote forms of Y strain of T. cruzi and continued breastfeeding for 25 days. Results: In 142 ofspring examined no infection through breastfeeding was observed. Conclusions: The low number of trypomastigote forms ingested by the newborn mice combined with biological and biochemical characteristics of blood trypomastigotes may explain the lack of transmission in this experiment. © Elsevier Editora Ltda.

N2  - PURPOSE: To describe the obstetric outcome of women with overweight/obesity treated at the prenatal care clinic of a public maternity hospital in Rio de Janeiro. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study which investigated 433 women (≥20 years-old, without any chronic diseases) and their newborns treated at public hospitals in Rio de Janeiro. Information was collected from medical records and through interviews. The characteristics of mothers and newborns evaluated were divided into maternal (social habits, anthropometric measurements and clinical, obstetric, and prenatal care) and newborn groups (birth conditions). Data regarding the categories of nutritional status were analyzed using the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: The prevalence of overweight/obesity in this sample was 24.5% (n=106). There was an association between inadequate weight gain and the prevalence of overweight/obesity (OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.5-4.9, p<0.05). Overweight/obese women had an increased risk for preeclampsia (OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.1-9.9, p=0.03). Regarding birth conditions, mean birth weight was 3291.3 g (±455.2), with rates of low birth weight of 4.7% (n=5) and rates of macrosomia of 2.8% (n=3). CONCLUSIONS: There was an alarming prevalence of inadequate nutritional status before and during pregnancy, which may be associated with increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. This suggests the need for nutritional monitoring of these pregnant women.

N2  - Objective: To assess the feasibility of HIV rapid testing for pregnant women at maternity hospital admission and of subsequent interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission. Methods: Study based on a convenience sample of women unaware of their HIV serostatus when they were admitted to delivery in public maternity hospitals in Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre, Brazil, between March 2000 and April 2002. Women were counseled and tested using the Determine HIV1/2 Rapid Test. HIV infection was confirmed using the Brazilian algorithm for HIV infection diagnosis. In utero transmission of HIV was determined using HIVDNA-PCR. There were performed descriptive analyses of sociodemographic data, number of previous pregnancies and abortions, number of prenatal care visits, timing of HIV testing, HIV rapid test result, neonatal and mother-tochild transmission interventions, by city studied. Results: HIV prevalence in women was 6.5% (N=1,439) in Porto Alegre and 1.3% (N=3.778) in Rio de Janeiro. In Porto Alegre most of women were tested during labor (88.7%), while in Rio de Janeiro most were tested in the postpartum (67.5%). One hundred and forty-four infants were born to 143 HIVinfected women. All newborns but one in each city received at least prophylaxis with oral zidovudine. It was possible to completely avoid newborn exposure to breast milk in 96.8% and 51.1% of the cases in Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro, respectively. Injectable intravenous zidovudine was administered during labor to 68.8% and 27.7% newborns in Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro, respectively. Among those from whom blood samples were collected within 48 hours of birth, in utero transmission of HIV was confirmed in 4 cases in Rio de Janeiro (4/47) and 6 cases in Porto Alegre (6/79). Conclusions: The strategy proved feasible in maternity hospitals in Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre. Efforts must be taken to maximize HIV testing during labor. There is a need of strong social support to provide this population access to health care services after hospital discharge.
