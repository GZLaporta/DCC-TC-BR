AB  - Background: Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) is an important neglected tropical illness, which has the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi as etiological agent and blood-feeding insects of the Triatominae subfamily as vectors. Despite its importance for disease epidemiology, field studies targeting microgeographic dispersal of triatomines in endemic areas are rare. The ability wingless nymphs have to move (crawl) within peridomestic settings is a key component regarding the design and development of rational control strategies. Methods: We double-marked Triatoma sordida fourth-instar nymphs (N4) with a reliable fluorescent dye and a trace element. This new methodology allowed us to simultaneously evaluate (i) nymph dispersal and (ii) the effectiveness of copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), and cadmium (Cd) trace elements as potential new markers. In the mark-release-recapture (MRR) experiment, 390 T. sordida N4 were released in the peridomicile of a single rural household, 130 individuals at each of three release points, at distances of 2, 5, and 10 m from the chicken coop (CC) and 27, 32, and 35 m away from the horse corral (HC). All specimens were double marked (Cu/blue, Cr/orange, Cd/green). Recaptures occurred in two intervals: 1–3 days and 15–17 days after release. Results: Specimens were successfully recaptured at all distances up to 10 m. A total of 19, 23, and 10 specimens were able to disperse 2, 5, and 10 m, respectively, to reach the CC. No insects were recaptured at the HC. Of the three analyte/paint combinations tested, Cr/orange gave the most promising results; Cu/blue marker and Cd/green marker performed very poorly with only 4/19 and 0/10 analyte/paint ratios, respectively. Conclusions: Triatoma sordida N4 could cover a distance of 10 m in 17 days. This indicates that nymphs seem to have a reduced dispersal capability compared to adults. Ninety-one percent of the 22 recaptured orange-marked nymphs were still Cr positive after the 17-day period evaluated. This makes this analyte a good candidate for future investigations that will apply this marking method in MRR studies. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Among the 18 genera of the Triatominae subfamily, three stand out for their diversity and epidemiological importance: Triatoma, Panstrongylus, and Rhodnius. Rhodnius includes 21 species that can transmit Trypanosoma cruzi (the etiological agent of Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis) and Trypanosoma rangeli. The Rhodnius prolixus complex comprises seven species, including Rhodnius marabaensis, Rhodnius prolixus, and Rhodnius robustus, which occur in the northern region of Brazil. Since both adults and immatures can carry T. cruzi, in this study the five nymphal instars of the three species mentioned were dorsally characterized. Methods: Using microscopy, morphometrics, and geometric morphometrics, the present work measures and describes the morphological characters of the five nymphal instars of R. marabaensis, R. prolixus, and R. robustus. Results: The study enabled the characterization of all five nymphal instars, as well as the distinction between the three species in each of their instars. Conclusions: The morphological, morphometrics of the head, thorax, and abdomen and geometric morphometrics studies of the head enabled the specific distinction of these three species in all five instars.

AB  - Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease, is endemic in 21 Latin American countries and particularly prevalent in Brazil. Chagas disease has drawn more attention in recent years due to its expansion into non-endemic areas. The aim of this work was to computationally identify and experimentally validate the natural products from an Annonaceae family as antichagasic agents. Through the ligand-based virtual screening, we identified 57 molecules with potential activity against the epimastigote form of T. cruzi. Then, 16 molecules were analyzed in the in vitro study, of which, six molecules displayed previously unknown antiepimastigote activity. We also evaluated these six molecules for trypanocidal activity. We observed that all six molecules have potential activity against the amastigote form, but no molecules were active against the trypomastigote form. 13-Epicupressic acid seems to be the most promising, as it was predicted as an active compound in the in silico study against the amastigote form of T. cruzi, in addition to having in vitro activity against the epimastigote form. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Aims: The aim of this study was to validate and update the risk score originally developed at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, verifying its performance in an infectious disease population. Methods: This is an observational study with consecutive selection of admission in a ward of participants with infectious diseases. Predictors were age, number of medications, intravenous drugs, potentially dangerous drugs, renal dysfunction, liver dysfunction, use of nasoenteral tube, nasogastric tube, gastrostomy feeding, jejunostomy feeding, oral enteral tube, total parenteral nutrition, cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction and immunosuppression. Outcome was defined as preventable prescription incidents by a clinical pharmacist. A GEE model was fit to make predictions each week. Results: A total of 219 patients participated in the study, 79.25% of whom had prescription incidents in the first week of admission. Predictors of the updated model were number of drugs prescribed, number of intravenous drugs, use of tubes, truncated age at 36 years and week of hospitalization. The performance of the original model was poor. The updated model's discrimination and calibration were moderate (overall AUC 0.74). A calculator to apply the model is available at https://pedrobrasil.shinyapps.io/INDWELL/. Conclusion: The updated risk score enabled the user to make predictions at admission and throughout the weeks, allowing for a prioritized weekly update for clinical pharmacy intervention. The updated model has a moderate and satisfactory performance for infectious disease patients. © 2022 British Pharmacological Society.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) affects at least 6 million people in 21 South American countries besides several thousand in other nations all over the world. It is estimated that at least 14,000 people die every year of CD. Since vaccines are not available, chemotherapy remains of pivotal relevance. About 30% of the treated patients cannot complete the therapy because of severe adverse reactions. Thus, the search for novel drugs is required. Here we tested the benznidazole (BZ) combination with the repositioned drug disulfiram (DSF) and its derivative diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC) upon Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro and in vivo. DETC-BZ combination was synergistic diminishing epimastigote proliferation and enhancing selective indexes up to over 10-fold. DETC was effective upon amastigotes of the BZ- partially resistant Y and the BZ-resistant Colombiana strains. The combination reduced proliferation even using low concentrations (e.g., 2.5 µM). Scanning electron microscopy revealed membrane discontinuities and cell body volume reduction. Transmission electron microscopy revealed remarkable enlargement of endoplasmic reticulum cisternae besides, dilated mitochondria with decreased electron density and disorganized kinetoplast DNA. At advanced stages, the cytoplasm vacuolation apparently impaired compartmentation. The fluorescent probe H2-DCFDA indicates the increased production of reactive oxygen species associated with enhanced lipid peroxidation in parasites incubated with DETC. The biochemical measurement indicates the downmodulation of thiol expression. DETC inhibited superoxide dismutase activity on parasites was more pronounced than in infected mice. In order to approach the DETC effects on intracellular infection, peritoneal macrophages were infected with Colombiana trypomastigotes. DETC addition diminished parasite numbers and the DETC-BZ combination was effective, despite the low concentrations used. In the murine infection, the combination significantly enhanced animal survival, decreasing parasitemia over BZ. Histopathology revealed that low doses of BZ-treated animals presented myocardial amastigote, not observed in combination-treated animals. The picrosirius collagen staining showed reduced myocardial fibrosis. Aminotransferase de aspartate, Aminotransferase de alanine, Creatine kinase, and urea plasma levels demonstrated that the combination was non-toxic. As DSF and DETC can reduce the toxicity of other drugs and resistance phenotypes, such a combination may be safe and effective.

AB  - Chagas disease (ChD) is a vector zoonosis native to the American continent caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi; the biological vectors are multiple species of hematophagous insects of the family Triatominae. A relevant aspect in the host–parasite relationship is the identification of the various genotypes of T. cruzi called discrete typing units (DTU) that circulate in mammals and vectors. In Chile, it has been described that the DTUs TcI, TcII, TcV, and TcVI circulate in infected humans, vectors, and wild animals. Identifying DTUs has acquired clinical importance, since it has been suggested that different genotypes could cause distinct pathologies, circulate in different geographical areas, and present different sensitivities to trypanocidal drugs. In this study, circulating T. cruzi DTUs in peripheral blood and Triatoma infestans dejections used in xenodiagnosis (XD) were amplified by qPCR in 14 Chilean patients with chronic ChD from highly endemic areas. More positive samples were detected by XD compared to peripheral blood samples, and 64.28% of the cases were simple infections and 35.72% mixed, with a statistically significant difference in the frequency of TcV DTU. This study would suggest that T. infestans from Chile is more competent to amplify one DTU over others, probably due to a process of co-evolution. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - A multi-epitope protein expressed in a prokaryotic system, including epitopes of Env, Gag, and Tax proteins of both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 was characterized for HTLV-1/2 serological screening. This tool can contribute to support the implementation of public policies to reduce HTLV-1/2 transmission in Brazil, the country with the highest absolute numbers of HTLV-1/2 infected individuals. The chimeric protein was tested in EIA using serum/plasma of HTLV-infected individuals and non-infected ones from four Brazilian states, including the North and Northeast regions (that present high prevalence of HTLV-1/2) and Southeast region (that presents intermediate prevalence rates) depicting different epidemiological context of HTLV-1/2 infection in our country. We enrolled samples from Pará (n = 114), Maranhão (n = 153), Minas Gerais (n = 225) and São Paulo (n = 59) states; they are from blood donors' candidates (Pará and Minas Gerais), pregnant women (Maranhão) and HIV+/high risk for sexually transmitted infection (STI; São Paulo). Among the HTLV-1/2 positive sera, there were co-infections with viral (HTLV-1 + HTLV-2, HIV, HCV, and HBV), bacterial (Treponema pallidum) and parasitic (Trypanosoma cruzi, Schistosma mansoni, Strongyloides stercoralis, Entamoeba coli, E. histolytica, and Endolimax nana) pathogens related to HTLV-1/2 co-morbidities that can contribute to inconclusive diagnostic results. Sera positive for HIV were included among the HTLV-1/2 negative samples. Considering both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2-infected samples from all states and different groups (blood donor candidates, pregnant women, and individuals with high risk for STI), mono or co-infected and HTLV-/HIV+, the test specificity ranged from 90.09 to 95.19% and the sensitivity from 82.41 to 92.36% with high accuracy (ROC AUC = 0.9552). This multi-epitope protein showed great potential to be used in serological screening of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 in different platforms, even taking into account the great regional variation and different profile of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 mono or co-infected individuals.

AB  - Chagas disease (ChD), caused by the hemoflagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is an important morbidity that affects approximately six million people in the American continent. T. cruzi parasites are mainly transmitted to human by the infected feces of blood-sucking triatomine insects. The persistent disease is endemic in many regions of South America, mostly affecting residents of rural areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate epidemiological aspects of ChD in the state of Pi-auí located in northeastern Brazil. This is an analytical cross-sectional study carried out from the collection of data of the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN, in Portuguese, Sistema de Informações de Agravos de Notificação) of suspected and confirmed cases of acute ChD in the state of Piauí, in the period 2010–2019. Associations between T. cruzi positivity and the study variables were determined by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and were raised as prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence interval. According to this survey, 517 suspected cases of acute ChD were reported in Piauí, with 70 cases (13.5%) confirmed. In 88.5% of confirmed cases, confirmation occurred by laboratory diagnosis. Most of the confirmed cases occurred in municipalities located in the semiarid region, with the municipality of São João do Piauí presenting the highest number of cases. Regarding sociodemographic data, females represent 55.7% of cases, people over 50 years of age (55.7%), being three cases in people up to 18 years of age, and less than 8 years of schooling (67.1%). 77.9% of confirmed cases had vector transmission as the probable form of infection. The data available in this study conclude that vectorial transmission of ChD in the state of Piauí remains active. This fact is corroborated by the number of notified and confirmed cases of acute ChD, requiring housing improvement programs and more effective epidemiological surveillance to control the transmission of the disease in the state. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Congenital transmission of Chagas disease plays an important role in endemic countries because it is not a diagnosis that is encountered frequently in prenatal care. Due to limited information regarding congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi in Mexico, the present study aimed to investigate protozoan infectivity and modulation of immune responses in human placental explants infected with T. cruzi Ia Mexican strains. The Inc-5 strain showed increased infectivity and modulated IL-1β, IL-10 and TLR-4, decreasing their expression after 24 h of infection. Both strains (Inc-5 and Ninoa) stimulated the production of TNF-α and decreased IL-6 levels 96 h after infection. An important detachment of the syncytiotrophoblast caused by infection with T. cruzi was observed after 24 h of infection. In this study, ex vivo infection of human placental villi was performed to better understand interactions involving parasitic T. cruzi and human placental tissue. It was concluded that the strains of TcIa present parasitism in placental tissue, modulation of the innate immune system of the placenta, and cause intense detachment of the syncytiotrophoblast, a fact that may be more associated with abortion and premature birth events than the congenital transmission itself, justifying the low rate of this transmission mechanism by this genotype.

AB  - Chagas disease also known as American trypanosomiasis, is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted by triatominae-contaminated feces. It is considered a neglected tropi- cal disease that affects 6 to 7 million people worldwide. The reactivation of Chagas disease occurs when the chronically infected hosts are not able to control T. cruzi infection, generat- ing recurrence of the acute phase. HIV is the main immunosuppressive infection that can lead to the reactivation of chronic Chagas disease in AIDS conditions. In co-infected patients, the reactivation of Chagas disease is related to their high parasite load, high HIV viral load, and CD4 T-cell counting less than 200/mm3, which may evolve to meningoen- cephalitis and myocarditis. Eight T. cruzi/HIV co-infected patients under antiretroviral ther- apy (ART) and ten Chagas disease patients without HIV infection that attended at Study Group of Chagas Disease, Hospital de Clınicas, University of Campinas (GEdoCh/HC/UNI- CAMP-SP) and Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas SP (PUCC/SP) were evaluated. Tests for Chagas disease were performed, such as qPCR and T. cruzi blood culture. The patient’s medical records were analyzed to verify clinical and epidemiological data, viral load, and CD4 T-cell counting since the outset of ART. For both groups, we found no stati- cally significant differences between parasite load via blood culture and qPCR. In T. cruzi/ HIV co-infected subjects, we observed a significant increase of CD4 T-cells counting and viral load decrease, which became undetectable over the years after ART. Parasites iso- lated from the patient’s blood culture were genotyped, being the majority of them infected with TcII and one case of mixed infection (TcII and TcV/TcVI). These results were expected according to the region of origin of the patients. We suggest that the parasite load be moni- tored through qPCR in T.cruzi/HIV co-infected patients. We conclude that ART in people liv- ing with HIV improves infection and immunosuppression control, enabling the natural evolution of the American trypanosomiasis. © 2022 Marcon et al.

AB  - The Triatoma sordida subcomplex traditionally included four triatomine species, T. sordida, Triatoma garciabesi, Triatoma guasayana, and Triatoma patagonica, distributed in the Southern Cone of South America. These species have a large intraspecific variability together with an overall similarity, making difficult to establish their taxonomic status. Many cytogenetic, morphometric, and molecular markers have been applied to address this. Recent studies have posed concerns on the inclusion of T. guasayana and T. patagonica within the subcomplex. Also, T. sordida from Argentina has been designed as a new species, Triatoma rosai. Using the cuticular hydrocarbon pattern as chemotaxonomic marker, the relationships among several populations of these species were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography and linear discriminant analysis along 25 collection sites in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay. T. sordida and T. rosai populations were differentially clustered in two CHC-based groups: "Group 1"included T. sordida from Eastern Brazil, Eastern Paraguay, and the Bolivian populations from La Paz and Izozog G1; "Group 2"included T. rosai, and T. sordida from Izozog G2 (Bolivia), and Western Paraguay. Whereas T. garciabesi remained closely related to T. sordida and T. rosai, T. guasayana, and T. patagonica were clearly separated from the species of the T. sordida subcomplex. Our results agree with those from other several techniques suggesting that the taxonomy of the T. sordida subcomplex should be revised. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The subfamily Triatominae (Hemiptera-Reduviidae) includes more than 150 blood-sucking species, potential vectors of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, causative agent of Chagas disease. A distinctive cytogenetic characteristic of this group is the presence of extremely stable chromosome numbers. Unexpectedly, the analyses of the chromosomal location of ribosomal gene clusters and other repetitive sequences place Triatominae as a significantly diverse hemipteran subfamily. Here, we advance the understanding of Triatominae chromosomal evolution through the analysis of the 45S rDNA cluster chromosomal location in 92 Triatominae species. We found the 45S rDNA clusters in one to four loci per haploid genome with different chromosomal patterns: On one or two autosomes, on one, two or three sex chromosomes, on the X chromosome plus one to three autosomes. The movement of 45S rDNA clusters is discussed in an evolutionary context. Our results illustrate that rDNA mobility has been relatively common in the past and in recent evolutionary history of the group. The high frequency of rDNA patterns involving autosomes and sex chromosomes among closely related species could affect genetic recombination and the viability of hybrid populations, which suggests that the mobility of rDNA clusters could be a driver of species diversification. © 2021 Royal Entomological Society.

AB  - Colombia has one of the largest burdens of Chagas disease globally, with about 438,000 people affected according to 2015 estimates. Despite this, < 1% of the population has had access to diagnosis and treatment. A patient-centered roadmap for Chagas disease was developed from 2015 onwards to address access barriers and increase diagnostic and therapeutic coverage and was implemented in five municipalities where Chagas disease is endemic. The mean number of people tested per year increased from 37 before the project to 262 following implementation, and the average days between medical order and diagnostic confirmation results decreased from 258 to 19. The mean days from diagnostic confirmation to treatment initiation decreased from 354 before the project to 135 after implementation. The 5,654 people tested included 3,467 women of childbearing age. The prevalence of T. cruzi infection was 11.5%, and thus far 266 people have received antitrypanosomal treatment. Collaborative creation and implementation of a patient-centered roadmap can address access barriers in specific contexts, helping to reduce the invisibility and burden of this neglected disease. © 2021

AB  - American tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) caused by Leishmania braziliensis is characterized by a spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from localized cutaneous ulcers (CL), mucosal (ML), or disseminated (DL) disease, to a subclinical (SC) asymptomatic form. Current diagnosis based on parasite culture and/or microscopy lacks sensitivity and specificity. Previous studies showed that patients with CL and ML have very high levels of Leishmania-specific anti-α-Gal antibodies. However, the native parasite α-Gal glycotope(s) is(are) still elusive, thus they have not yet been explored for a more accurate TL diagnosis. Using a chemiluminescent immunoassay, we evaluated the seroreactivity of TL patients across its clinical spectrum, and of endemic (EC) and nonendemic healthy controls (NEC) against three synthetic neoglycoproteins (NGP29b, NGP30b, and NGP28b), respectively comprising the L. major-derived type-2 glycoinositolphospholipid (GIPL)-1 (Galfβ1,3Manα), GIPL-2 (Galα1,3Galfβ1,3Manα), and GIPL-3 (Galα1,6Galα1,3Galfβ) glycotopes. Contrary to NGP29b and NGP30b, NGP28b exhibited high sensitivity and specificity to a CL serum pool. More importantly, NGP28b reacted strongly and specifically with individual sera from distinct clinical forms of TL, especially with SC sera, with 94% sensitivity and 97% specificity, by post-two-graph receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis. Contrary to NGP29b, NGP28b showed low cross-reactivity with Chagas disease and control (NEC/EC) sera. Additionally, seroreactivity of CL patients against NGP28b was significantly decreased after successful chemotherapy, indicating that L. braziliensis-specific anti-α-Gal antibodies may serve as an early biomarker of cure in CL. Our data also points towards the applicability of L. major type-2 GIPL-3-derived Galα1,6Galα1,3Galfβ glycotope for the serological diagnosis of American TL, particularly of the subclinical form. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - As of the nineteenth century, the number of world fairs and hygiene exhibitions grew significantly. This phenomenon was linked to the experience of modernity and the emergence of bacteriology, when different cities were sanitized with the aim of combating urban diseases and epidemics. For the purpose of sanitary education and hygiene propaganda, many objects and pictures were displayed in hygiene exhibitions and museums, such as the International Hygiene Exhibition of 1911 and the German Hygiene Museum, both in Dresden. The goal of this article is to analyze a chapter of the international history of health through images that portray the connections between the German Hygiene Museum and Latin American countries between 1911 and 1933. © 2022, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

AB  - Currently, Chagas disease, or human American trypanosomiasis, affects around 900 people in Portugal, mostly Brazilian immigrants, the main foreign population residing in the country. This article presents a historical inquiry on the first receptions of the Brazilian discovery of Chagas disease in Portugal, a country that had scientists interested in the study of tropical diseases, namely sleeping sickness, or African trypanosomiasis, which affected epidemic in the African colonies of Angola and the island of Príncipe. The time frame of this study is limited between 1909, the date of Carlos Chagas' scientific discovery, and 1924, the year in which the already internationally renowed Brazilian physician, then traveling through Europe, was invited by Portuguese colleagues to give a lecture on American trypanosomiasis in Lisbon. In methodological terms, this article was written based on the work of scrutinizing publications in scientific periodicals, inaugural theses defended in medical schools and Portuguese press news. © 2022 ISCTE-IUL.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is a parasitic zoonosis endemic in Brazil. Despite virtual control of Triatoma infestans, the main domesticated vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, vectorial transmission by other triatomine species persists in some rural communities. This study aims to characterize triatomines role in transmitting T. cruzi to dogs and humans in the district of Santo Inácio, located in the northwest region of the state of Bahia, Brazil. It also describes environmental factors in housings associated with insect occurrence and assesses the perception, knowledge, and preventive practices adopted by the population regarding CD. Blood samples of humans and dogs, and biological samples of triatomines, were collected between November 2018 and February 2019 and subjected to the detection of T. cruzi by serological and molecular biology tests. Also, we applied a questionnaire to research the perception, knowledge, and local practices of people related to CD. The capture of triatomines in households was associated with exploratory variables of the questionnaires using multivariate logistic regression (p < 0.05). The 155 triatomines captured in the wild and domestic environment were of the species Triatoma sherlocki (n = 151), Panstrongylus sherlocki (n = 1) and Triatoma sordida (n = 3), and had a natural infection rate for T. cruzi by PCR of 18.5%, 100% and 0%, respectively. District residents (n = 126) were seronegative for T. cruzi, while 17.5% (7/40) of the dogs were seropositive. The fact that residents are aware that triatomines can “cause” CD was configured as a protection factor for residents according to the fitted logistic regression model (p = 0.04). However, respondents have limited perception and knowledge about the CD, prevention and control practices for triatomines in a household. The results suggest the existence of a domestic cycle of transmission of T. cruzi between triatomines and dogs, configuring a latent risk of infection to the human population of Santo Inácio. Studies that clarify the potential for the establishing of intrusive triatomines in households, surveillance actions for triatomines, and health education in rural communities are indispensable to prevent the reemergence of CD in vulnerable regions of Brazil and other American countries with similar epidemiological characteristics. © 2021

AB  - The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has defined Chagas Disease hotspots in Central America associated with the vector Triatoma spp. Triatoma dimidiata is a native vector adapted to multiple environments, including intra-domestic and peri-domestic habitats. A multi-institutional project named “Alliances for the elimination of Chagas in Central America” was created to help reduce the incidence of the disease in the region. Activities performed in the field as part of the project included aspects of vector surveillance and control, improvement of houses, diagnosis and treatment of individuals, health promotion, training of human resources and identification of access barriers to diagnosis and treatment. As a base line study, eleven villages, comprised of 1,572 households, were entomologically evaluated (83.4% overall participation); five were found to have very high infestation rates (>20%), three had high infestation rates (8-20%) and three had low-infestation rates (<8%), coinciding with the category of infestation-risk of the houses within each village. Serological tests were carried out in 812 people (>80% participation) in two of the 11 villages and none of the 128 children tested, less than 5 years of age, were positive for Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Community participation in all the activities was high (>70%). The collaboration between several subnational, national, and international institutions, each with specific roles, promoted community participation in the activities of vector control and patient care, thus, establishing a baseline to continue implementing and monitoring project progress. © 2021

AB  - Background and Objectives: Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic to Mexico, Central and South America. While initially limited to the Americas, emigration of infected persons triggered geographically broader blood safety challenges. To mitigate transfusion-transmitted Chagas (TTC), transfusion services implemented approaches including risk factor questions and serologic testing. We sought to understand and compare strategies in non-endemic countries. Materials and Methods: Transfusion services in International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT)-affiliated organizations and members of the ISBT Working Party on Transfusion-Transmitted Infectious Diseases were invited to complete an online survey on T. cruzi mitigation strategies. The survey queried about cases of TTC, risk factors, testing methodology, educational materials, pathogen reduction, donor/product management, donor deferral and perceived public health concerns surrounding TTC. Results: Responses were received from 27 institutions in 22 countries. Most countries (77.3%) reported no historical TTC cases, while 18.2% reported 1–5 cases and 4.5% reported 6–10 cases. Concern about Chagas among the general public and public health authorities was low, but 12 of 25 blood centres reported moderate/high concern. Overall, 17 countries mitigated for TTC: 15 used risk factor questions and 10tested for T. cruzi antibodies. Ten countries used pathogen reduction but not specifically to prevent TTC. Conclusion: While Chagas is rarely cited as a public health concern, blood centres in many non-endemic countries, including those outside the Americas, implemented measures to mitigate risk. Mitigation focussed on risk factors associated with Latin American immigrants and serologic testing. Thus, despite the rarity of TTC, many non-endemic countries continue to address it as an ongoing blood safety risk. © 2021 International Society of Blood Transfusion.

AB  - Aims: This study aimed to estimate the annual mortality risk and its determinants in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. Methods and results: We conducted a systematic search in MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Cochrane Library, and LILACS. Longitudinal studies published between 1 January 1946 and 24 October 2018 were included. A random-effects meta-analysis using the death rate over the mean follow-up period in years was used to obtain pooled estimated annual mortality rates. Main outcomes were defined as all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular, non-cardiovascular, heart failure, stroke, and sudden cardiac deaths. A total of 5005 studies were screened for eligibility. A total of 52 longitudinal studies for chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy including 9569 patients and 2250 deaths were selected. The meta-analysis revealed an annual all-cause mortality rate of 7.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.3–10.1; I2 = 97.74%; T2 = 0.70] among patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. The pooled estimated annual cardiovascular death rate was 6.3% (95% CI: 4.9–8.0; I2 = 96.32%; T2 = 0.52). The annual mortality rates for heart failure, sudden death, and stroke were 3.5%, 2.6%, and 0.4%, respectively. Meta-regression showed that low left ventricular ejection fraction (coefficient = −0.04; 95% CI: −0.07, −0.02; P = 0.001) was associated with an increased mortality risk. Subgroup analysis based on American Heart Association (AHA) classification revealed pooled estimate rates of 4.8%, 8.7%, 13.9%, and 22.4% (P &lt; 0.001) for B1/B2, B2/C, C, and C/D stages of cardiomyopathy, respectively. Conclusions: The annual mortality risk in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy is substantial and primarily attributable to cardiovascular causes. This risk significantly increases in patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction and those classified as AHA stages C and C/D. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Laboratory diagnosis of leishmaniasis shows variable efficacy in detecting infected mammalian hosts and there is a need to identify suitable antigens to improve the accuracy of diagnostic tests. In the present study, a L. infantum hypothetical protein called LiHyQ was evaluated for the diagnosis of tegumentary (TL) and visceral (VL) leishmaniasis using canine and human samples. A collection of dog sera (n=155) were tested and contained samples from asymptomatic (n=20) and symptomatic (n=25) VL animals, from healthy dogs living in endemic (n=25) or non-endemic (n=25) areas of disease, from Leish-Tec® vaccinated dogs (n=20) or from dogs infected with Ehrlichia canis (n=15), Babesia canis (n=10) and Trypanosoma cruzi (n=15). Sensitivity (Se), Specificity (Sp), Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 100% were observed for rLiHyQ with these samples, whereas the Se, Sp, PPV and NPV values with L. infantum Soluble Leishmania Antigen (SLA) preparation were 60.0%, 99.0%, 96.0% and 86.0%, respectively. A collection of human sera (n=305) were tested and contained samples from TL (n=50) and VL (n=40) patients, from VL/HIV co-infected patients (n=35), from patients infected with HIV alone (n=30), Chagas Disease (n=30), malaria (n=10), tuberculosis (n=10), paracoccidioidomycosis (n=15), leprosy (n=30) or aspergillosis (n=15); and from healthy subjects (n=40). Se, Sp, PPV and NPV values of 100% were observed for rLiHyQ with these samples, whereas the Se, Sp, PPV and NPV values with SLA were 58.0%, 76.0%, 50.0% and 82.0%, respectively. The antibody reactivity against the protein was compared with commercial kits, and the kappa index varied from 0.95 to 1.00 for rLiHyQ, and of 0.55 to 0.82 for the kits. In addition, the serological follow-up of treated patients showed a significant reduction in rLiHyQ-specific IgG antibody levels. All canine and human samples were tested at the same time using the same reagents, in order to reduce experimental variation and interference in data interpretation. In conclusion, our preliminary data suggest a diagnostic and prognostic role for rLiHyQ against leishmaniasis. © 2021

AB  - Background: Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease (CD) or American trypanosomiasis, an important public health problem in Latin America. Benznidazole (BZ), a drug available for its treatment, has limited efficacy and significant side effects. Essential oils (EOs) have demonstrated trypanocidal activity and may constitute a therapeutic alternative. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of the EOs of clove (CEO - Syzygium aromaticum) and ginger (GEO - Zingiber officinale), administered alone and in combination with BZ, in Swiss mice infected with T. cruzi. Methods: The animals were inoculated with 10,000 blood trypomastigotes of the Y strain of T. cruzi II by gavage and divided into four groups (n = 12 to 15): 1) untreated control (NT); 2) treated with BZ; 3) treated with CEO or GEO; and 4) treated with BZ + CEO or GEO. The treatments consisted of oral administration of 100 mg/kg/day, from the 5th day after parasite inoculation, for 20 consecutive days. All groups were submitted to fresh blood examination (FBE), blood culture (BC), conventional PCR (cPCR) and real-time PCR (qPCR), before and after immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide. Results: Clove and ginger EOs, administered alone and in combination with BZ, promoted suppression of parasitemia (p < 0.0001), except for the animals treated with CEO alone, which presented a parasitemia curve similar to NT animals. However, there was a decrease in the BC positivity rate (p < 0.05) and parasite load (< 0.0001) in this group. Treatment with GEO alone, on the other hand, besides promoting a decrease in the BC positivity rate (p < 0.05) and parasite load (p < 0.01), this EO also resulted in a decrease in mortality rate (p < 0.05) of treated mice. Conclusions: Decreased parasite load, as detected by qPCR, was observed in all treatment groups (BZ, CEO, GEO and BZ + EOs), demonstrating benefits even in the absence of parasitological cure, thus opening perspectives for further studies. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Trypanosoma rangeli is a non-virulent hemoflagellate parasite infecting humans, wild and domestic mammals in Central and Latin America. The share of genotypic, phenotypic, and biological similarities with the virulent, human-infective T. cruzi and T. brucei, allows comparative studies on mechanisms of pathogenesis. In this study, investigation of the T. rangeli Arginine Kinase (TrAK) revealed two highly similar copies of the AK gene in this taxon, and a distinct expression profile and activity between replicative and infective forms. Although TrAK expression seems stable during epimastigotes growth, the enzymatic activity increases during the exponential growth phase and decreases from the stationary phase onwards. No differences were observed in activity or expression levels of TrAK during in vitro differentiation from epimastigotes to infective forms, and no detectable AK expression was observed for blood trypomastigotes. Overexpression of TrAK by T. rangeli showed no effects on the in vitro growth pattern, differentiation to infective forms, or infectivity to mice and triatomines. Although differences in TrAK expression and activity were observed among T. rangeli strains from distinct genetic lineages, our results indicate an up-regulation during parasite replication and putative post-translational myristoylation of this enzyme. We conclude that up-regulation of TrAK activity in epimastigotes appears to improve proliferation fitness, while reduced TrAK expression in blood trypomastigotes may be related to short-term and subpatent parasitemia in mammalian hosts. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The mechanism of vertical transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi is poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the role of IgG subclasses in the congenital transmission of Chagas disease. We conducted a case-control study in a public maternity hospital in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, enrolling women at delivery. Thirty women who transmitted T. cruzi to their newborns (cases), and 51 women who did not (controls) were randomly selected from 676 total seropositive women. Trypanosoma cruzi-specific IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 levels were measured by in-house ELISA. The IgG4 levels were unmeasurable as a result of low levels in all participants. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction results and demographic factors were also analyzed. One-unit increases in normalized absorbance ratio of IgG1 or IgG2 levels increased the odds of congenital T. cruzi transmission in Chagas-seropositive women by 2.0 (95% CI: 1.1-3.6) and 2.27 (95% CI: 0.9-5.7), adjusted for age and previous blood transfusion. Odds of congenital transmission were 7.0 times higher in parasitemic mothers (95% CI: 2.3-21.3, P < 0.01) compared with nonparasitemic mothers. We observed that all mothers with IgG1 ≥ 4 were transmitters (sensitivity = 20%, specificity = 100%). Additionally, no mothers with IgG2 < 1.13 were transmitters (sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 21.6%). We demonstrated that IgG subclasses and parasite presence in blood are associated with vertical transmission of T. cruzi and could identify women at increased risk for congenital transmission by measuring IgG subclasses. These measures have potential as objective screening tests to predict the congenital transmission of Chagas.

AB  - Chagas disease causes more deaths in the Americas than any other parasitic disease. Initially confined to the American continent, it is increasingly becoming a global health problem. In fact, it is considered to be an “exotic” disease in Europe, being virtually undiagnosed. Benznidazole, the only drug approved for treatment, effectively treats acute-stage Chagas disease, but its effectiveness for treating indeterminate and chronic stages remains uncertain. Previously, our research group demonstrated that 4-thiazolidinones presented anti-T. cruzi activity including in the in vivo assays in mice, making this fragment appealing for drug development. The present work reports the synthesis and anti-T. cruzi activities of a novel series of 4-thiazolidinones derivatives that resulted in an increased anti-T. cruzi activity in comparison to thiosemicarbazones intermediates. Compounds 2c, 2e, and 3a showed potent inhibition of the trypomastigote form of the parasite at low cytotoxicity concentrations in mouse splenocytes. Besides, all the 2c, 2e, and 3a tested concentrations showed no cytotoxic activity on macrophages cell viability. When macrophages were submitted to T. cruzi infection and treated with 2c and 3a, compounds reduced the release of trypomastigote forms. Results also showed that the increased trypanocidal activity induced by 2c and 3a is independent of nitric oxide release. Flow cytometry assay showed that compound 2e was able to induce necrosis and apoptosis in trypomastigotes. Parasites treated with the compounds 2e, 3a, and 3c presented flagellum shortening, retraction and curvature of the parasite body, and extravasation of the internal content. Together, these data revealed a novel series of 4-thiazolidinones fragment-based compounds with potential effects against T. cruzi and lead-like characteristics. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is endemic from Latin American countries. The goal of our study was to identify novel genetic loci associated with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy development in Chagas disease patients from different Latin American populations. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional, nested case-control study including 3 sample collections from Colombia, Argentina, and Bolivia. Samples were genotyped to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS). These results were meta-Analyzed with summary statistic data from Brazil, gathering a total of 3413 Chagas disease patients. To identify the functional impact of the associated variant and its proxies, we performed an in silico analysis of this region. Results: The meta-Analysis revealed a novel genome-wide statistically significant association with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy development in rs2458298 (OR=0.90, 95%CI=0.87-0.94, P-value=3.27×10-08), nearby the SAC3D1 gene. In addition, further in silico analyses displayed functional relationships between the associated variant and the SNX15, BAFT2, and FERMT3 genes, related to cardiovascular traits. Conclusions: Our findings support the role of the host genetic factors in the susceptibility to the development of the chronic cardiac form of this neglected disease. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease, CD) affects circa 7 million persons worldwide. While of those persons present the asymptomatic, indeterminate chronic form (ICF), many will eventually progress to cardiac or digestive disorders. We studied a nonconcurrent (retro-spective) cohort of patients attending an outpatient CD clinic in Southeastern Brazil, who were admitted while presenting the ICF in the period from 1998 through 2018 and followed until 2019. The outcomes of interest were the progression to cardiac or digestive CD forms. We were also interested in analyzing the impact of Benznidazole therapy on the progression of the disease. Extensive review of medical charts and laboratory files was conducted, col-lecting data up to year 2019. Demographics (upon inclusion), body mass index, comorbidi-ties (including the Charlson index) and use of Benznidazole were recorded. The outcomes were defined by abnormalities in those test that could not be attributed to other causes. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariable Cox regression models. Among 379 subjects included in the study, 87 (22.9%) and 100 (26.4%) progressed to cardiac and digestive forms, respectively. In the final multivariable model, cardiac disorders were posi-tively associated with previous coronary syndrome (Hazzard Ratio [HR], 2.42; 95% Confi-dence Interval [CI], 1.53–3.81) and negatively associated with Benznidazole therapy (HR, 0.26; 95%CI, 0.11–0.60). On the other hand, female gender was the only independent pre-dictor of progression to digestive forms (HR, 1.56; 95%CI, 1.03–2.38). Our results point to the impact of comorbidities on progression do cardiac CD, with possible benefit of the use of Benznidazole. © 2021 Nunes da Costa et al.

AB  - Chagas disease remains an important public health problem with high morbidity and mortality in several Latin American countries. This nationwide population-based ecological study analyzes the epidemiological characteristics and time trends of Chagas disease-related mortality in Brazil, 2000–2019. We included all deaths reported in Brazil in which Chagas disease was mentioned in the death certificate either as an underlying or associated cause of death (multiple causes of death). Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates (per 100,000 inhabitants) were calculated and time trends analysis was performed using joinpoint regression models. In the study period, a total of 22,663,092 deaths were recorded in Brazil. Chagas disease was identified in 122,291 deaths (0.54%), 94.788 (77.5%) as an underlying cause and 27,503 (22.5%) as an associated cause. Average annual age-adjusted mortality rate was 3.22 deaths/100,000 inhabitants (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.14-3.30). Chronic Chagas disease with cardiac involvement was the predominant clinical presentation mentioned. The highest mortality rates were observed in males, age group ≥80 years, black race/skin color, schooling 1-3 years of study, and residents in the Central-West region. Age-adjusted mortality rates showed a significant declining trend at the national level in the period (Average Annual Percent Change: -3.1%; 95% CI: -3.3; -3.0), with different local patterns and a more pronounced reduction in important endemic areas in the past. The findings show that, despite a consistent decline in mortality rates in Brazil over the study period, Chagas disease remains an important and neglected cause of death in the country, showing a marked regional variation that has social and health care implications. In addition to the control measures for disease transmission, it is necessary to guarantee access, coverage, and quality of health care to Chagas disease patients, seeking to prevent the occurrence of severe forms and deaths from the disease. © 2021

AB  - Rhodnius prolixus is the principal vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease in American countries. This insect is haematophagous during all life cycles and, to antagonize its haemostatic, inflammatory and immune systems, it secretes saliva while feeding on the vertebrate host's blood. Here, we investigated characteristic changes of the salivary glands (SG) that occur during insect development. Two pairs of lobules and ducts comprise the SG of R. prolixus. The organ's size increases over time, but the microanatomical structures are preserved during insect development. Both lobules have a single layer epithelium formed by binucleated cells, which surrounds the saliva reservoir. The principal lobule presents higher polysaccharide and total protein contents than the accessory lobe. A network of external muscle layers is responsible for organ contraction and saliva release. Apocrine, merocrine and holocrine secretion types occur in the secretory epithelium. Dopamine, serotonin and tyrosine-hydroxylase are neural-related molecules that regulate SG function both during and after feeding. ©

AB  - American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL) is an endemic disease in Latin America, mainly caused in Brazil by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. Clinical manifestations vary from mild, localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) to aggressive mucosal disease. The host immune response strongly determines the outcome of infection and pattern of disease. However, the pathogenesis of ATL is not well understood, and host microRNAs (miRNAs) may have a role in this context. In the present study, miRNAs were quantified using qPCR arrays in human monocytic THP-1 cells infected in vitro with L. (V.) braziliensis promastigotes and in plasma from patients with ATL, focusing on inflammatory response-specific miRNAs. Patients with active or self-healed cutaneous leishmaniasis patients, with confirmed parasitological or immunological diagnosis, were compared with healthy controls. Computational target prediction of significantly-altered miRNAs from in vitro L. (V.) braziliensis-infected THP-1 cells revealed predicted targets involved in diverse pathways, including chemokine signaling, inflammatory, cellular proliferation, and tissue repair processes. In plasma, we observed distinct miRNA expression in patients with self-healed and active lesions compared with healthy controls. Some miRNAs dysregulated during THP-1 in vitro infection were also found in plasma from self-healed patients, including miR-548d-3p, which was upregulated in infected THP-1 cells and in plasma from self-healed patients. As miR-548d-3p was predicted to target the chemokine pathway and inflammation is a central to the pathogenesis of ATL, we evaluated the effect of transient transfection of a miR-548d-3p inhibitor on L. (V.) braziliensis infected-THP-1 cells. Inhibition of miR-548d-3p reduced parasite growth early after infection and increased production of MCP1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, and IP10/CXCL10. In plasma of self-healed patients, MCP1/CCL2, RANTES/CCL5, and IL-8/CXCL8 concentrations were significantly decreased and MIG/CXCL9 and IP-10/CXCL10 increased compared to patients with active disease. These data suggest that by modulating miRNAs, L. (V.) braziliensis may interfere with chemokine production and hence the inflammatory processes underpinning lesion resolution. Our data suggest miR-548d-3p could be further evaluated as a prognostic marker for ATL and/or as a host-directed therapeutic target. © Copyright © 2021 Souza, Ramos-Sanchez, Muxel, Lagos, Reis, Pereira, Brito, Zampieri, Kaye, Floeter-Winter and Goto.

AB  - The Rhodniini tribe is one of the five tribes in the subfamily Triatominae and is notorious for its domestic blood-sucking pests and vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi across Latin America. The human and economic costs of the Chagas disease in the American tropics are considerable, and these insects are of unquestionable importance to humans. We used mitochondrial rDNA (16S), nuclear ribosomal RNA (28S) and wingless (Wg) sequences to perform phylogenetic analysis to derive trees based on parsimony and maximum likelihood. Nucleotide sequences were used in molecular-clock analyses to estimate time divergence between species of Rhodniini. The potential distribution of each species was modeled and compared with Kappa statistic. Multivariate niches with bioclimatic variables were used to describe differences between the species using discriminant analysis. The results of this study indicate that the Rhodniini originated 17.91 Mya ago. Rhodnius domesticus is the oldest species having its origin at 9.13 Mya. Rhodniini are closely related to Salyavatinae that are specialist termite predators and diverged from this subfamily 30.43 Mya. Most species are clearly allopatric and have distinct bioclimatic niches. The colonization of bromeliads, palms trees and bird nests represent important events for the speciation of these taxa. The hematophagous habit can be described as a scenario where Rhodniini’s ancestor could be pre-adapted for the invasion of bromeliads, palm trees, and bird nests where they would find significant water availability and thermal damping. These environments are widely used by vertebrate inquilines that would be the source of food for the species of Rhodniini. Lastly, our results show an alternative position of Psammolestes in the phylogenetic tree. © Copyright © 2021 de Paula, Barreto, Telmo, Diotaiuti and Galvão.

AB  - Armadillos are specialist diggers and their burrows are used to find food, seek shelter and protect their pups. These burrows can also be shared with dozens of vertebrate and invertebrate species and; consequently, their parasites including the zoonotics. The aim of this study was to diagnose the presence of zoonotic parasites in four wild-caught armadillo species from two different Brazilian ecosystems, the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) and the Pantanal (wetland). The investigated parasites and their correspondent diseases were: Toxoplasma gondii (toxoplasmosis), Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease), Leishmania spp., (leishmaniasis), Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Paracoccidioidomicosis) and Mycobacterium leprae (Hansen's disease). Forty-three free-living armadillos from Pantanal and seven road-killed armadillos from the Cerrado were sampled. Trypanosoma cruzi DTU TcIII were isolated from 2 out of 43 (4.65%) armadillos, including one of them also infected with Trypanosoma rangeli. Antibodies anti-T. gondii were detected in 13 out of 43 (30.2%) armadillos. All seven armadillos from Cerrado tested positive for P. brasiliensis DNA, in the lungs, spleen, liver fragments. Also, by molecular analysis, all 43 individuals were negative for M. leprae and Leishmania spp. Armadillos were infected by T. cruzi, T. rangeli, P. brasiliensis and presented seric antibodies to T. gondii, highlighting the importance of those armadillos could have in the epidemiology of zoonotic parasites. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - South American opossums of the order Didelphimorphia are considered sentinels for zoonotic infections and environmental diseases, such as for Chagas disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of data regarding protozoan diseases such Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum in Neotropical marsupials; despite these pathogens have been considered threats to some marsupial species. The aim of this study was to determine whether Didelphis albiventris and Philander frenatus opossums from southern Brazil had been previously exposed to T. cruzi, T. gondii or N. caninum. Opossum samples were obtained by live-trapping of free-ranging animals and collection at wildlife rehabilitation centers in Rio Grande do Sul (RS) state, Brazil. The detection of anti-T. cruzi and anti-T. gondii antibodies was performed by indirect hemagglutination and anti-N. caninum antibodies by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In total, samples were collected from 76 marsupials from nine municipalities in RS state, including 69 D. albiventris (white-eared opossum), and seven were P. frenatus (southern four-eyed opossum). For T. cruzi, 11% were seropositive, and for T. gondii 26% were seropositive. None of the marsupials sampled here were seropositive for N. caninum. Risk factor analysis showed that free-living animals were about five-fold more likely to be infected by T. gondii than were rescued animals. Our study showed the exposure of Neotropical marsupials (D. albiventris and P. frenatus) to protozoan pathogens T. cruzi and T. gondii, while no evidence of N. caninum exposure was found. The set of results presented here may have an effect on ecology and conservation of the studied species and may also indicate possible sentinels of these pathogen circulation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas disease (CD) is a disease caused by the protozoan flagellates of the Kinetoplastid order Trypanosoma cruzi. Approximately 8,000,000 people are infected worldwide, mainly in Latin America, causing disabilities and more than 10,000 deaths per year. Objective: This study aimed to describe the epidemiological panorama of CD in the Western Brazilian Amazon from 2007 to 2018. Methods: In this ecological study, secondary data regarding the confirmed cases of T. cruzi infection in the states of Acre, Amazonas, Rondônia, and Roraima were collected from the Single Health System Notification Information System of the Department of Informatics of the Single Health System and were analyzed. The data were used to characterize the epidemiological profile of T. cruzi infection and to determine the frequency of infection in Western Amazonia. Results: A total of 184 cases of CD were reported in Western Amazonia, and the highest number of cases was reported in the states of Amazonas and Acre. Conclusion: The epidemiological panorama of the Western Brazilian Amazon from 2007 to 2018 includes a greater number of cases of T. cruzi infection in men aged 20–39 years and those living in rural areas. Oral transmission was prevalent in the region during the study, and the highest number of cases was reported in the months of April and December. Epidemiological data are an important resource for understanding the dynamics of CD and the main aspects related to the health-disease process. © The authors (2021), this article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

AB  - The earliest interaction between macrophages and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is particularly important in paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) progression, and surface proteins play a central role in this process. The present study investigated the contribution of β2 integrin in P. brasiliensis-macrophage interaction and PCM progression. We infected β2-low expression (CD18low) and wild type (WT) mice with P. brasiliensis 18. Disease progression was evaluated for fungal burden, lung granulomatous lesions, nitrate levels, and serum antibody production. Besides, the in vitro capacity of macrophages to internalize and kill fungal yeasts was investigated. Our results revealed that CD18low mice infected with Pb18 survived during the time analyzed; their lungs showed fewer granulomas, a lower fungal load, lower levels of nitrate, and production of high levels of IgG1 in comparison to WT animals. Our results revealed that in vitro macrophages from CD18low mice slowly internalized yeast cells, showing a lower fungal burden compared to WT cells. The migration capacity of macrophages was compromised and showed a higher intensity in the lysosome signal when compared with WT mice. Our data suggest that β2 integrins play an important role in fungal survival inside macrophages, and once phagocytosed, the macrophage may serve as a protective environment for P. brasiliensis. © Copyright © 2021 de Oliveira, Reis, Catão, Amaral, Souza, Ribeiro, Faccioli, Carneiro, Marina, Bürgel, Fernandes, Tavares and Bocca.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, a zoonotic kinetoplastid protozoan parasite, is the causative agent of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease). Having a very plastic, repetitive and complex genome, the parasite displays a highly diverse repertoire of surface molecules, with pivotal roles in cell invasion, immune evasion and pathogenesis. Before 2016, the complexity of the genomic regions containing these genes impaired the assembly of a genome at chromosomal level, making it impossible to study the structure and function of the several thousand repetitive genes encoding the surface molecules of the parasite. We here describe the genome assembly of the Sylvio X10/1 genome sequence, which since 2016 has been used as a reference genome sequence for T. cruzi clade I (TcI), produced using high coverage PacBio single-molecule sequencing. It was used to analyze deep Illumina sequence data from 34 T. cruzi TcI isolates and clones from different geographic locations, sample sources and clinical outcomes. Resolution of the surface molecule gene distribution showed the unusual duality in the organization of the parasite genome, a synteny of the core genomic region with related protozoa flanked by unique and highly plastic multigene family clusters encoding surface antigens. The presence of abundant interspersed retrotransposons in these multigene family clusters suggests that these elements are involved in a recombination mechanism for the generation of antigenic variation and evasion of the host immune response on these TcI strains. The comparative genomic analysis of the cohort of TcI strains revealed multiple cases of such recombination events involving surface molecule genes and has provided new insights into T. cruzi population structure. © Copyright © 2021 Talavera-López, Messenger, Lewis, Yeo, Reis-Cunha, Matos, Bartholomeu, Calzada, Saldaña, Ramírez, Guhl, Ocaña-Mayorga, Costales, Gorchakov, Jones, Nolan, Teixeira, Carrasco, Bottazzi, Hotez, Murray, Grijalva, Burleigh, Grisard, Miles and Andersson.

AB  - Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease strongly associated with low socioeconomic status, affecting nearly 8 million people – mainly Latin Americans. The current infection risk is based on acute case reports, most of which are typically associated with oral transmissions. In the semi-arid region of Northeastern Brazil, serious outbreaks of this transmission type have surged in the last years. One of those occurred in 2016 in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. Rural residents of four municipalities surrounding Marcelino Vieira ingested sugar cane juice – which was probably ground with Trypanosoma cruzi-infected insects. Eighteen cases of Chagas disease were confirmed serologically, with two deaths reported. Socioeconomic information, schooling of residents and the structure of peridomestic and domestic environments in the rural area of Marcelino Vieira, along with entomological indicators, were investigated to understand better the factors related to the outbreaks in this region. We found triatomines (mainly Triatoma brasiliensis) in 35% (24/67) of domiciliary units and all rocky outcrops inspected (n = 7). Overall, 25% (91/357) of examined T. brasiliensis were infected by T. cruzi in artificial ecotopes, with almost the same prevalence in the sylvatic environment (22%; 35/154). Among all ecotopes investigated, wood/tile/brick piles were the ones linked to high insect infestations and triatomine T. cruzi infection prevalence. Ninety-five percent of people interviewed recognized the triatomines and knew the classic route of transmission of disease – triatomine bite-dependent. However, only 7.5% admitted knowledge that Chagas disease can also be acquired orally – which poses a risk this transmission route currently recognized. Here, we highlight the physical proximity between humans and triatomine populations with high T. cruzi infection prevalence as an additional risk factor to oral/vector contaminations. In sum, residents have low income, low level of education, and/or a willful disregard for the routes of Chagas disease transmission (specifically oral transmission), a combination of factors that may have favored the Chagas disease outbreak. We here provide recommendations to avoid further outbreaks. © 2020

AB  - Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a neglected mycosis most commonly occurring in Latin America. The etiologic agents are thermo dimorphic fungi of the genus Paracoccidioides, and cause an important granulomatous response in affected tissues. The Botucatu Medical School, from São Paulo State University (UNESP), is a PCM study pole, located in São Paulo State Midwest region, which is classified as a hyperendemic area in the Southeast region in Brazil. This study aimed to perform a retrospective epidemiological, geographical, and clinical analysis by the information available in medical records. It was listed as socio-demographic data along with clinical characteristics from patients diagnosed and treated during a 10-year period in Botucatu, totaling 177 patients with Paracoccidioidomycosis con-firmed by the histopathological test. It was observed that the main clinical presentation was the chronic type (76,3%), most commonly identified in white male individuals over the age of 29 years old, smokers, and alcoholics, providing evidences for the first time that white individuals were more affected by the disease, in comparison to non-white individuals that may be more resistant to infection. This data opens new avenues for study within ancestry, resis-tance and susceptibility in paracoccidioidomycosis. © 2021 Zeminian de Oliveira et al.

AB  - Trypanosoma rangeli is the second most common American trypanosome that infects man. It is vectored by triatomines from the genus Rhodnius, in which it invades the hemolymph and infects the salivary glands, avoiding the bug immune responses. In insects, these responses are initiated by well conserved pathways, mainly the IMD, Toll, and Jak/STAT. We hypothesize that long-term infection with T. rangeli in the gut or hemolymph of Rhodnius prolixus triggers different systemic immune responses, which influence the number of parasites that survive inside the vector. Thus, we investigated groups of insects with infections in the gut and/or hemolymph, and evaluated the parasite load and the expression in the fat body of transcription factors (Rp-Relish, Rp-Dorsal, and Rp-STAT) and inhibitors (Rp-Cactus and Rp-Caspar) of the IMD, Toll, and Jak/STAT pathways. We detected lower parasite counts in the gut of insects without hemolymph infection, compared to hemolymph-infected groups. Besides, we measured higher parasite numbers in the gut of bugs that were first inoculated with T. rangeli and then fed on infected mice, compared with control insects, indicating that hemolymph infection increases parasite numbers in the gut. Interestingly, we observed that genes from the three immune pathways where differentially modulated, depending on the region parasites were present, as we found (1) Rp-Relish downregulated in gut-and/or-hemolymph-infected insects, compared with controls; (2) Rp-Cactus upregulated in gut-infected insect, compared with controls and gut-and-hemolymph-infected groups; and (3) Rp-STAT downregulated in all groups of hemolymph-infected insects. Finally, we uncovered negative correlations between parasite loads in the gut and Rp-Relish and Rp-Cactus expression, and between parasite counts in the hemolymph and Rp-Relish levels, suggesting an association between parasite numbers and the IMD and Toll pathways. Overall, our findings reveal new players in R. prolixus–T. rangeli interactions that could be key for the capacity of the bug to transmit the pathogen. © Copyright © 2021 Rolandelli, Nascimento, Silva, Rivera-Pomar and Guarneri.

AB  - The taxonomic status of Triatoma dimidiata (Latreille, 1811) is, by far, the most discussed within Triatominae. Molecular studies have recovered at least three independently evolving lineages in T. dimidiata across its range. The original description of T. dimidiata (as Reduvius dimidiatus) included few taxonomic characters, and no types were assigned. To define and describe the cryptic diversity within T. dimidiata sensu lato (s.l.), a neotype must be designated. For this purpose, all 199 specimens identified as T. dimidiata from the collections of the Smithsonian Institution – National Museum of Natural History and the American Museum of Natural History, ranging from Peru to Mexico, were studied. Only one specimen (from Tumbes, Peru) matched the combination of characters as listed in the original description, and it is herein formally designated as the neotype for T. dimidiata. The neotype is morphologically described and DNA sequences of its whole mitochondrial genome and the nuclear second internal transcribed spacer region (ITS2), commonly used in triatomine molecular systematics studies, are presented and compared to other publicly available sequences of T. dimidiata s.l. in GenBank. Our results suggest that T. dimidiata sensu stricto (s.s.) is somewhat rare and, therefore, unlikely to serve as a major vector of Chagas disease. © S. A. Justi, C. Dale.

AB  - The Coleção de Vetores de Tripanosomatídeos (Fiocruz/COLVET), Minas Gerais, Brazil, stands out as one of the most important collections of blood-sucking triatomines, the vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi that causes Chagas disease. The aim is to describe the collection and the services it provides to support scientific research, educational activities, and entomological surveillance between 2013–2019.The data associated with the specimens held in Fiocruz/COLVET is available from the Sistema de Informação sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr). These specimen metadata were analyzed and either tabulated or plot-ted on graph and maps. The records of services provided by the collection between 2013–2019 were also categorized and analyzed. There are 12,568 triatomine specimens deposited in the collection that belong to 77 species and 11 genera, from 15 American countries. Of the ~ 65 species of triatomines found in Brazil, 38 (57.6%) are present in the collection, including specimens from all biomes and all but three Brazilian states. The occurrence of Triatoma costalimai, Triatoma lenti, Rhodnius nasutus, and Panstrongylus lenti apparently collected beyond their known distribution ranges are reported and discussed. The collection provided 168 services, supporting educational activities (41.7%), scientific research (35.7%), and regional/national entomological surveillance of triatomines (22.6%). Between the years 2014 and 2020, the number of biological specimens deposited in the Fiocruz/COLVET repository increased from 4,778 to 12,568 triatomine specimens. In addition to its great value to biodiversity conservation, the collection is of great importance because of its support of research and educational activities, and contributions to entomological surveillance, and, therefore, to public health. © 2021, Pensoft Publishers.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) has been changing from an endemic Latino-American disease to a condition found outside endemic regions, due to migratory movements. Although often subclinical, its acute phase can be lethal. This study aimed to assess survival during the acute phase of CD and its relationship with ventricular function in an experimental model. To this end, 30 Syrian hamsters were inoculated with Trypanosoma cruzi (IG) and other 15 animals received saline solution (CG). Groups were monitored daily and submitted to echocardiography in two moments: before the challenge and 15 days post-infection. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and global longitudinal myocardial strain (GLS) of the LV were measured. The IG was divided into groups of animals with and without clinical signs of disease. ANOVA for mixed models was used to compare ventricular function parameters. Survival analysis was studied using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test. The follow-up lasted 60 days. LVEF in IG was reduced through time (53.80 to 43.55%) compared to CG (57.86 to 59.73%) (p=0.002). There was also a reduction of GLS (-18.97% to-12.44%) in the IG compared to CG (p=0.012). Twelve animals from IG died compared to one animal from CG. Eleven out of the 12 animals from the IG group died before presenting with clinical signs of infection. Survival was reduced in the IG compared to CG over time (p=0.02). The reduced survival during the acute phase of this experimental model of Chagas disease was related to the significant reduction of LV function. The mortality rate in the IG was higher in the group presenting with clinical signs of infection. © 2021, Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) still imposes a heavy burden on most Latin American countries. Vector-borne and mother-to-child transmission cause several thousand new infections per year, and at least 5 million people carry Trypanosoma cruzi. Access to diagnosis and medical care, however, is far from universal. Starting in the 1990s, CD-endemic countries and the Pan American Health Organization-World Health Organization (PAHO-WHO) launched a series of multinational initiatives for CD control-surveillance. An overview of the initiatives’ aims, achievements, and challenges reveals some key common themes that we discuss here in the context of the WHO 2030 goals for CD. Transmission of T. cruzi via blood transfusion and organ transplantation is effectively under control. T. cruzi, however, is a zoonotic pathogen with 100+ vector species widely spread across the Americas; interrupting vector-borne transmission seems therefore unfeasible. Stronger surveillance systems are, and will continue to be, needed to monitor and control CD. Prevention of vertical transmission demands boosting current efforts to screen pregnant and childbearing-aged women. Finally, integral patient care is a critical unmet need in most countries. The decades-long experience of the initiatives, in sum, hints at the practical impossibility of interrupting vector-borne T. cruzi transmission in the Americas. The concept of disease control seems to provide a more realistic description of what can in effect be achieved by 2030. © 2021, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study describes difficulties in the monitoring of a child born during an oral outbreak of Chagas disease, in which there are several indications that the transmission occurred through the congenital route: 1. the mother was in the third trimester of pregnancy when she was infected; 2. She presented high parasitemia at the time of delivery; 3. In both, the mother and her daughter, T. cruzi was classified as DTU TcIV. The parasites were not found in the blood at birth and the infection was detected only three months later in an asymptomatic infant. As the mother and her child live in a highly endemic area, vector transmission could not be excluded during this period. © 2021, Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo. All rights reserved.

AB  - Triatoma is the most diversified and one of the most important genera from an epidemiolog-ical perspective. Given the difficulty in identifying some species of the Triatoma genus, morphological, histological, and morphometric studies were performed to provide new characters that make it possible to differentiate T. garciabesi, T. guasayana, T. patagonica, and T. sordida sensu stricto, triatomines that overlap geographically and have vector potential. Through the external female genitalia, as well as morphology, morphometry, and histology of eggshells, it was possible to discriminate the four species. In addition, this study reinforces the taxonomic validity of T. garciabesi and provides new data for discussion on systematic issues of T. guasayana and T. patagonica. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis), colonizes the intestinal tract of triatomines. Triatomine bugs act as vectors in the life cycle of the parasite and transmit infective parasite stages to animals and humans. Contact of the vector with T. cruzi alters its intestinal microbial composition, which may also affect the associated metabolic patterns of the insect. Earlier studies suggest that the complexity of the triatomine fecal metabolome may play a role in vector competence for different T. cruzi strains. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry and supervised machine learning, we aimed to detect differences in the intestinal metabolome of the triatomine Rhodnius prolixus and predict whether the insect had been exposed to T. cruzi or not based solely upon their metabolic profile. We were able to predict the exposure status of R. prolixus to T. cruzi with accuracies of 93.6%, 94.2% and 91.8% using logistic regression, a random forest classifier and a gradient boosting machine model, respectively. We extracted the most important features in producing the models and identified the major metabolites which assist in positive classification. This work highlights the complex interactions between triatomine vector and parasite including effects on the metabolic signature of the insect. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Summary. Human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a major public health problem worldwide, leading to significant mortality rates if not properly treated and controlled. Precise identification of infected patients is essential to establish treatment and control measures. Although several VL serological diagnosis advances have been accomplished lately, mainly using recombinant antigens and immunochromatographic tests (ICTs), improvements may still be achieved using multiepitope chimeric proteins in different test platforms. Here, we reported on the evaluation of ELISA and an ICT developed with a new chimeric protein, named DTL-4, based on repetitive antigenic sequences, including those present in the A2 protein. Methods. A total of 1028 sera samples were used for the development and validation of ELISA (321 samples from L. infantum-infected patients, 62 samples from VL/AIDS coinfected patients, 236 samples from patients infected with other diseases, and 409 samples from healthy donors). A total of 520 sera samples were used to develop and validate ICT (249 samples from L. infantum-infected patients, 46 samples from VL/AIDS coinfected patients, 40 samples from patients infected with other diseases, and 185 samples from healthy donors). Findings. Using the validation sera panels, DTL-4-based ELISA displayed an overall sensitivity of 94.61% (95% CI: 89.94-97.28), a specificity of 99.41% (95% CI: 96.39-99.99), and an accuracy of 97.02% (95% CI: 94.61-98.38), while for ICT, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values corresponded to 91.98% (95% CI: 86.65-95.39), 100.00% (95% CI: 96.30-100.00), and 95.14% (95% CI: 91.62-97.15), respectively. When testing sera samples from VL/AIDS coinfected patients, DTL-4-ELISA displayed a sensitivity of 77.42% (95% CI: 65.48-86.16), a specificity of 99.41% (95% CI: 96.39-99.99), and an accuracy of 93.51% (95% CI: 89.49%-96.10%), while for DTL-4-ICT, sensitivity was 73.91% (95% CI: 59.74-84.40), specificity was 90.63% (95% CI: 81.02-95.63), and accuracy was 82.00% (95% CI: 73.63-90.91). Conclusion. DTL-4 is a promising candidate antigen for serodiagnosis of VL patients, including those with VL/AIDS coinfection, when incorporated into ELISA or ICT test formats. © 2021 Maria Marta Figueiredo et al.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas disease is a health problem that affects approximately 7 million people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Vector transmission is one of the most important routes in South and Central American countries. Between 2013 and 2019, municipalities of Sergipe sent 507 triatomines for analysis, unveiling the largest records found in the south in the villages of Poço da Clara, Alagoinhas and Pilões, and the municipality of Tobias Barreto. The high prevalence of infected vectors in these localities motivated this epidemiological study. Methods: After educational lectures on the vectors and risks of the disease, a structured questionnaire was administered to identify areas and risk factors for transmission of the parasite. The data guided the collection of vectors and blood samples from domestic reservoirs. Results: The studied region is considered endemic for triatomines infected by Trypanosoma cruzi with three species of vectors; the highest prevalence was Panstrongylus lutzi (54.83%), followed by Triatoma pseudomaculata (43.54%), and Triatoma tibiamaculata (1.61%). In the villages in this study, 100% of the vectors were found intradomically. The coexistence of residents with domestic animals was reported by 62.04% (255) of those surveyed. Forty-one small animals that were actively living with humans at home in the localities were evaluated serologically. No infection was observed in the domestic animals. Conclusions: There are favorable conditions for the domiciliation of triatomines in the evaluated locations, contributing to the risk of vectorial transmission of Chagas disease. © 2021, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and it is mainly acquired through the vector route, however, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are implicated in the spread of the illness worldwide. The congenital route can occur at any stage of pregnancy and its frequency varies. In the Federal District, in Brazil, the frequency of T. cruzi infection in pregnant women and their offspring has not been updated. Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in pregnant women and the rate of congenital transmission in the Federal District. A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of T. cruzi from 2014 to 2016 in the population of pregnant women attended by the public health service throughout the Federal District and a descriptive cohort for the evaluation of congenital transmission. During the study, prenatal data of 98,895 women were consulted and pregnant women registered in 2016, presenting with positive T. cruzi serology, were part of the descriptive cohort. The estimated prevalence of T. cruzi infection in the three years was 0.19% and the congenital transmission rate was 1/40 (2.5%). Our results have shown that, although the main routes of transmission of CD have been interrupted, there is still a risk of congenital transmission in the Federal District. This present study highlights the need for the continuous implementation of a screening program for pregnant women and timely treatment of infected newborns and children. © 2021, Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo.

AB  - Background: American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) is caused by different Leishmania parasites, which stimulate and direct the immune response against the infection. Objective: To evaluate the TaqMan probe technology applicability to diagnose and identifying of Leishmania spp. related to the ACL etiology. Methodology: Through the MEGA 6.0 software, performed an in silico analysis using multiple alignments of Leishmania spp. which were available on GenBank for different genomic targets. The efficiency (e), specificity and detection limit (DL) were calculated for each system, these were associated to compose a duplex-qPCR (DqPCR). The samples of blood, lesion biopsy and lesion imprint on filter paper from patients residing in states of Amazonas (AM) and Pernambuco (PE)-Brazil, (cases and controls) were used to perform the DqPCR technique. The capacity to identify the Leishmania species was determined by comparison with isoenzymes method and sequencing analysis. Results: Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (rDNA) was the target selected. Two sets of primers and probes were designed and combined: SVS for subgenus Viannia and LaS for L. (L.) amazonensis. The results were: SVSe = 93.24%, SVS DL = 50 fg/μL; LaSe = 89.3%, LaSLD = 5 fg/μL presented 100% of specificity. In total, 236 individuals participated of the present study, wherein were 101 blood samples, 33 biopsies and 147 lesion imprints. The imprint was the most sensitive sample, showing 83.06% of sensitivity, 86.96% of specificity and substantial agreement between the techniques analysis (k = 0.531; p < 0,001). Regarding the species identification, DqPCR and sequencing/isoenzymes have agreed at 100%, since the infection is caused by a single Leishmania species. Conclusion: The DqPCR technique was applicable in diagnosis and identification of Leishmania spp. (subgenus Viannia and L. amazonensis). Furthermore, the lesion imprint is less invasive, allowing a fewer discomfort and greater acceptance by the patients, in addition of being low cost and easy handling. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of American trypanosomiasis and can infect humans and different species of domestic and wild animals. The marsupials are important wild reservoirs of T. cruzi, aiding in the maintenance of this agent in sylvatic and peri-domestic environments. The objective of this study was to report the parasitological and clinicopathological findings of a natural infection by T. cruzi in one specimen of Philander opossum that originated from the Brazilian Amazon. The animal was captured in a forest fragment near a rural community with reports of human Chagas disease. T. cruzi infection was diagnosed by blood smear examinations, blood culture, scent glands secretion culture, histopathological examination, and nested-PCR. Positive samples were subjected to PCR to characterize the discrete typing units (DTUs) of T. cruzi. Characteristic trypomastigotes of T. cruzi were observed in the blood smear, and spheromastigotes, epimastigotes, and trypomastigotes were visualized in the cultures. Non-suppurative myocarditis associated with amastigote clusters was the principal histopathological finding. DNA from T. cruzi was detected in samples of blood, blood cultures, scent glands secretion cultures, cardiac muscles, and the spleen. The TcI and the TcII/V/VI group DTUs were detected in blood culture and scent glands secretion cultures. Infection by T. cruzi can cause myocarditis in P. opossum and DTUs TcI and TcII/V/VI group mixed infection can be detected in the acute phase. P. opossum can be a source of infection for triatomine vectors and has the potential source for direct transmission of T. cruzi by secretions from the scent glands. These data are important to improve the understanding of the complex enzootic transmission cycle of T. cruzi in the Brazilian Amazon. © 2020

AB  - Neolignan licarin A (1) was isolated from leaves of Nectandra oppositifolia (Lauraceae) and displayed activity against trypomastigote forms of the etiologic agent of American trypanosomiasis, Trypanosoma cruzi. Aiming for the establishment of SAR, five different compounds (1a – 1e) were prepared and tested against T. cruzi. The 2-allyl derivative of licarin A (1d) exhibited higher activity against trypomastigotes of T. cruzi (IC50 = 5.0 μM and SI = 9.0), while its heterocyclic derivative 1e displayed IC50 of 10.5 μM and reduced toxicity against NCTC cells (SI &gt; 19.0). However, these compounds presented limited oral bioavailability estimation (&lt;85%, Papp &lt;1.0 × 10−6 cm/s) in parallel artificial membrane permeability assays (PAMPA) due to excessive lipophilicity. Based on these results, different simplified structures of licarin A were designed: vanillin (2), vanillyl alcohol (3), isoeugenol (4), and eugenol (5), as well as its corresponding methyl (a), acetyl (b), O-allyl (c), and C-allyl (d) analogues. Vanillin (2) and its acetyl derivative (2b) displayed expressive activity against intracellular amastigotes of T. cruzi with IC50 values of 5.5 and 5.6 μM, respectively, and reduced toxicity against NCTC cells (CC50 &gt; 200 μM). In addition, these simplified analogues showed a better permeability profile (Papp &gt; 1.0 × 10−6 cm/s) on PAMPA models, resulting in improved drug-likeness. Vanillyl alcohol acetyl derivative (3b) and isoeugenol methyl derivative (4a) displayed activity against the extracellular forms of T. cruzi (trypomastigotes) with IC50 values of 5.1 and 8.8 μM respectively. Based on these results, compounds with higher selectivity index against extracellular forms of the parasite (1d, 1e, 3d, and 4a) were selected for a mechanism of action study. After a short incubation period (1 h) all compounds increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels of trypomastigotes, suggesting cellular oxidative stress. The ATP levels were increased after two hours of incubation, possibly involving a high energy expenditure of the parasite to control the homeostasis. Except for compound 4a, all compounds induced hyperpolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, demonstrating a mitochondrial imbalance. Considering the unique mitochondria apparatus of T. cruzi and the lethal alterations induced by structurally based on licarin A, these compounds are interesting hits for future drug discovery studies in Chagas disease. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - The increasing detection of infections of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, in non-endemic regions beyond Latin America has risen to be a major public health issue. With an impact in the millions of people, current treatments rely on antiquated drugs that produce severe side effects and are considered nearly ineffective for the chronic phase. The minimal progress in the development of new drugs highlights the need for advances in basic research on crucial biochemical pathways in T. cruzi to identify new targets. Here, we report on the T. cruzi presenilin-like transmembrane aspartyl enzyme, a protease of the aspartic class in a unique phylogenetic subgroup with T. vivax separate from protozoans. Computational analyses suggest it contains nine transmembrane domains and an active site with the characteristic PALP motif of the A22 family. Multiple linear B-cell epitopes were identified by SPOT-synthesis analysis with Chagasic patient sera. Two were chosen to generate rabbit antisera, whose signal was primarily localized to the flagellar pocket, intracellular vesicles, and endoplasmic reticulum in parasites by whole-cell immunofluorescence. The results suggest that the parasitic presenilin-like enzyme could have a role in the secretory pathway and serve as a target for the generation of new therapeutics specific to the T. cruzi. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is a worldwide neglected disease, encompassing asymptomatic infections and different clinical forms, such as American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (ATL) which is part of the complex of diseases caused by protozoan parasites from Leishmania genus, transmitted by sand fly vectors. As a neglected disease, much effort is still needed in treatment and diagnosis. Currently, ATL diagnosis is mainly made by parasite detection by microscopy. The sensitivity of the method varies, and factors such as collection procedures interfere. Molecular approaches, specially based on Real Time PCR (qPCR) technique, has been widely used to detect Leishmania infection and to quantify parasite load, once it is a simple, rapid and sensitive methodology, capable to detect low parasite concentrations and less prone to variability. Although many studies have been already published addressing the use of this technique, an improvement on these methodologies, including an analytical validation, standardization and data association is demanded. Moreover, a proper validation by the assay by the use of clinical samples is still required. In this sense, the purpose of the present work is to compare the performance of qPCR using two commonly used targets (18S rDNA and HSP70) with an internal control (RNAse P) in multiplex reactions. Addition-ally, we validated reactions by assaying 88 samples from patients presenting different clinical forms of leishmaniasis (cutaneous, mucosal, recent and old lesions), representing the diversity found in Brazil’s Amazon Region. Following the methodology proposed herein, the results indicate the use of both qPCR assays, 18S rDNA and HSP70, to achieve a very good net sensitivity (98.5%) and specificity (100%), performing simultaneous or sequential testing, respectively. With this approach, our main goal is to conclude the first step of a further multicenter study to propose the standardization of detection and quantification of Leishmania. © 2020 Filgueira et al.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasitic protozoan that infects various species of domestic and wild animals, triatomine bugs and humans. It is the etiological agent of American trypanosomiasis, also known as Chagas Disease, which affects about 17 million people in Latin America and is emerging elsewhere in the world. Iron (Fe) is a crucial micronutrient for almost all cells, acting as a cofactor for several metabolic enzymes. T. cruzi has a high requirement for Fe, using heminic and non-heminic Fe for growth and differentiation. Fe occurs in the oxidized (Fe3+) form in aerobic environments and needs to be reduced to Fe2+ before it enters cells. Fe-reductase, located in the plasma membranes of some organisms, catalyzes the Fe3+⇒ Fe2+ conversion. In the present study we found an amino acid sequence in silico that allowed us to identify a novel 35 kDa protein in T. cruzi with two transmembrane domains in the C-terminal region containing His residues that are conserved in the Ferric Reductase Domain Superfamily and are required for catalyzing Fe3+ reduction. Accordingly, we named this protein TcFR. Intact epimastigotes from the T. cruzi DM28c strain reduced the artificial Fe3+-containing substrate potassium ferricyanide in a cell density-dependent manner, following Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The TcFR activity was more than eightfold higher in a plasma membrane-enriched fraction than in whole homogenates, and this increase was consistent with the intensity of the 35 kDa band on Western blotting images obtained using anti-NOX5 raised against the human antigen. Immunofluorescence experiments demonstrated TcFR on the parasite surface. That TcFR is part of a catalytic complex allowing T. cruzi to take up Fe from the medium was confirmed by experiments in which DM28c was assayed after culturing in Fe-depleted medium: (i) proliferation during the stationary growth phase was five times slower; (ii) the relative expression of TcFR (qPCR) was 50% greater; (iii) intact cells had 120% higher Fe-reductase activity. This ensemble of results indicates that TcFR is a conserved enzyme in T. cruzi, and its catalytic properties are modulated in order to respond to external Fe fluctuations. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Shelters are places that receive certain species of domestic animals, mostly dogs and cats, that are normally abandoned. These animals are easy to handle because they are crowded and have limited movement. Dogs, due to the close relationship with humans, are considered the main domestic reservoirs in the peridomiciliary cycle of American trypanosomiasis infection in humans. Therefore, in several countries studies are carried out to assess the occurrence of infection in these animals. This work evaluated the occurrence of Trypanosoma cruzi in dogs from shelters in the city of Aracaju, Sergipe. This was an observational and cross-sectional study to detect the occurrence of T. cruzi in blood samples from shelter dogs using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the TcZ1/TcZ2 primers. A total of 168 blood samples from dogs (104 females and 64 males) were collected and subjected to DNA and PCR extraction, and seventeen (10.1%) samples showed amplification of the product of the expected size. The TcZ1/TcZ2 primer pair used is considered specific for T. cruzi, and it is capable of amplifying all strains without amplifying other Trypanosoma species. The shelters evaluated had different physical infrastructure; animals positive for T. cruzi were found in all of them, as confirmed by sequencing. It is concluded that shelter dogs, as well as other domestic animals, can function as indicators of the occurrence of T. cruzi in Aracaju-SE, providing relevant epidemiological information for health surveillance and monitoring of Trypanosomatid infections. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is a widespread protozoan in Latin America causing Chagas disease in humans and able to infect several other mammal species. The objective of this study was to investigate the T. cruzi infection in triatomine fauna as well as in dogs from distinct areas of Acre, western Brazilian Amazonia, which recently reported acute cases of human CD as well as an area that have not notify this disease recently. Triatomines were collected and the intestinal contents were evaluated for the presence of trypanosomatids by optical microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the mini-exon gene. Blood smear, hemoculture, PCR and serology were performed in the studied mammals. Fecal content of four triatomines were positive (11.6%) in the fresh examination. Molecular analysis identified Trypanosoma cruzi TCI in two specimens. Blood samples from 90 dogs were obtained. Trypanosoma sp. was observed in six blood smears (6/83, 7.22%). Seropositivity for T. cruzi was 8/89 (8.98). One dog's hemoculture was obtained and characterized as T. rangeli. PCR reactions in blood clots resulted in one positive dog (1/75, 1.3%) infected by T. janseni, providing a new mammalian host for a recently described Trypanosoma species. The results demonstrate the low exposition and prevalence for T. cruzi suggesting that dogs are not important to T. cruzi transmission cycle in the studied áreas. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal toxoplasmosis remains a neglected disease worldwide and few government programs focusing on its prevention are available. Success in these programs has been extensively reported in the literature, yet the strategies used for their implementation, as a model for such actions in different communities, have not been described. OBJECTIVES: To describe the aspects of prenatal care strategies in 13 municipalities within the regional healthcare unit of Araçatuba, in the northwestern region of the state of São Paulo in 2017, focusing on congenital toxoplasmosis. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive study on prenatal healthcare within the Brazilian National Health Sys-tem, in 13 participating municipalities. METHODS: Data on serological tests, referral clinics, notifications, healthcare strategies, health education and drugs for infected children were requested through a questionnaire that was sent via e-mail to people responsible for healthcare services in these municipalities. RESULTS: Major differences relating to diagnoses, reference outpatient clinics, notifications, health education and healthcare and drugs for infected children were reported among the prenatal strategies of these 13 municipal healthcare services. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of standardized prenatal strategy in the study area may compromise the prevention of infection. However, our identification of each aspect of prenatal care corroborates the need to implement a healthcare surveillance program relating to congenital toxoplasmosis. © 2020 by Associação Paulista de Medicina.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and is endemic of the Americas. The control of the disease is restricted to toxic and potentially teratogenic drugs, which limit the use during pregnancy. The use of food supplementation offers a safe and low-cost form to alleviate Chagas disease symptoms, mostly in areas with alimentary risk. For example, zinc demonstrates positive effects in immune response, including in Chagas disease during pregnancy. Purpose: This study describes the innate response in pregnant rats chronically infected with T. cruzi and supplemented with zinc. Methods: Pregnant female Wistar rats, infected with T. cruzi, were treated with 20 mg/kg/day zinc sulfate and euthanized on the 18th day. Samples (plasma, splenocytes, and peritoneal exudate) were collected and several immune parameters (nitric oxide, RT1B, CD80/CD86, MCP-1, CD11b/c, NK/NKT, IL-2, IL-10, INF-cc, and apoptosis) evaluated. Results: Under Zinc supplementation and/or T. cruzi infection, the gestation developed normally. Several innate immune parameters such as RT1B, CD80/CD86, MCP-1 expressing lymphocytes, IL-2, and IL-17 were positively altered, whereas nitric oxide, CD11b/c, NK/NKT, apoptosis, INF-γ, and corticosterone demonstrated a pro-pregnancy pattern. Conclusion: Our results indicated that zinc has diverse effects on immune response during pregnancy. An anti-T. cruzi immunity, as well as a pro-gestation response, were observed after zinc supplementation. The complete comprehension of zinc supplementation in pregnancy will base an adequate strategy to alleviate Chagas disease symptoms and propagation, especially for populations from endemic areas. © 2020, Witold Stefański Institute of Parasitology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Background: Retrospective observational studies suggest that transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi does not occur in treated women when pregnant later in life. The level of parasitemia is a known risk factor for congenital transmission. Benznidazole (BZN) is the drug of choice for preconceptional treatment to reduce parasitic load. The fear of treatment-related side effects limits the implementation of the Argentine guideline recommending BZN 60d/300 mg (or equivalent) treatment of T. cruzi seropositive women during the postpartum period to prevent transmission in a future pregnancy. A short and low dose BZN treatment might reduce major side effects and increase compliance, but its efficacy to reduce T. cruzi parasitic load compared to the standard 60d/300 mg course is not yet established. Clinical trials testing alternative BZN courses among women of reproductive age are urgently needed. Methods and design: We are proposing to perform a double-blinded, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial comparing a short low dose 30-day treatment with BZN 150 mg/day (30d/150 mg) vs. BZN 60d/300 mg. We will recruit not previously treated T. cruzi seropositive women with a live birth during the postpartum period in Argentina, randomize them at 6 months postpartum, and follow them up with the following specific aims: Specific aim 1: to measure the effect of BZN 30d/150 mg compared to 60d/300 mg preconceptional treatment on parasitic load measured by the frequency of positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (primary outcome) and by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), immediately and 10 months after treatment. Specific aim 2: to measure the frequency of serious adverse events and/or any adverse event leading to treatment interruption. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov. Identifier: NCT03672487.

AB  - Importance: Chagas cardiomyopathy is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Precise estimates of the risk of developing cardiomyopathy among patients with the acute or indeterminate chronic forms of Chagas disease are lacking. Objective: To estimate the risk of developing chronic cardiomyopathy in patients with acute and indeterminate chronic forms of Chagas disease. Data Sources: A systematic search in the Cochrane Library, Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), Medline, and Web of Science Core Collection databases was conducted from October 8 to October 24, 2018. Studies published between January 1, 1946, and October 24, 2018, that were written in the English, Spanish, and Portuguese languages were included. Search terms included Chagas disease; development of cardiomyopathy; latency duration; and determinants of the Chagas latency period. Study Selection: Longitudinal observational studies of participants diagnosed with the acute phase of Chagas infection or the indeterminate chronic form of Chagas disease who were followed up until the development of cardiomyopathy were included. Studies were excluded if they did not provide sufficient outcome data. Of 10 761 records initially screened, 32 studies met the criteria for analysis. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Critical appraisals of studies were performed using checklists from the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's Manual, and data were collected from published studies. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to obtain pooled estimated annual rates. Data were analyzed from September 11 to December 4, 2019. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline for the registration of the protocol, data collection and integrity, assessment of bias, and sensitivity analyses. Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcomes were defined as the composite of the development of any new arrhythmias or changes in electrocardiogram results, dilated cardiomyopathy and segmental wall motion abnormalities in echocardiogram results, and mortality associated with Chagas disease. Results: A total of 5005 records were screened for eligibility. Of those, 298 full-text articles were reviewed, and 178 of those articles were considered for inclusion in the quantitative synthesis. After exclusions, 32 studies that included longitudinal observational outcomes were selected for the analysis; 23 of those studies comprised patients with the indeterminate chronic form of Chagas disease, and 9 of those studies comprised patients in the acute phase of Chagas infection. The analysis indicated that the pooled estimated annual rate of cardiomyopathy development was 1.9% (95% CI, 1.3%-3.0%; I2 = 98.0%; τ2 [ln scale] = 0.9992) in patients with indeterminate chronic Chagas disease and 4.6% (95% CI, 2.7%-7.9%; I2 = 86.6%; τ2 [ln scale] = 0.4946) in patients with acute Chagas infection. Conclusions and Relevance: Patients with the indeterminate chronic form of Chagas disease had a significant annual risk of developing cardiomyopathy. The annual risk was more than double among patients in the acute phase of Chagas infection.

AB  - Genotyping of the genus Paracoccidioides showed its diversity and geographical distribu-tion. Four species constituting the Paracoccidioides brasiliensis complex and Paracocci-dioides lutzii are etiological agents of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). However, there are no studies comparing the clinical and epidemiological aspects between PCM caused by the P. brasiliensis complex and by P. lutzii. Demographic and clinical data from 81 patients with PCM—confirmed by mycological and/or histopathological examination—from Mato Grosso do Sul state (Brazil) were studied. All patients underwent serology by immunodiffusion with antigens obtained from the P. brasiliensis complex (ExoPb and gp43) and Cell Free Antigens obtained from P.lutzii (CFAPl).The cases were classified regarding their serological profile into three groups: G1: PCM patients seropositive to ExoPb and/or gp43 and seroneg-ative to CFAPl (n = 51), assumed to have PCM caused by P. brasiliensis complex; G2: PCM patients seronegative to gp43 and seropositive to CFAPl (n = 16), with PCM caused by P. lutzii; and G3: PCM patients seropositive to ExoPb or gp43 and seropositive to CFAPl (n = 14), with undetermined serological profile, was excluded from the analyses. The Fisher’s exact test or the Mann-Whitney U test, and cluster analysis according to Ward’s method and Euclidean distance were used to analyze the results. Patients with serological profile suggestive of P. lutzii lived predominantly in municipalities in the Central and Southern regions of the state, while those with serological profile indicative of the P. brasiliensis complex were distributed throughout the state. No differences were found between the two groups regarding gender, age, schooling, rural work, clinical form, severity, organs involved, intensity of pulmonary involvement, degree of anemia, erythrocyte sedimentation rate values, and ther-apeutic response. PCM patients with serological profile suggestive of P. lutzii and PCM patients with serological profile indicative of P. brasiliensis complex showed the same clinical and radiological presentations. © 2020 Pereira et al.

AB  - Bone biopsy is still the gold standard to assess bone turnover (T), mineralization (M), and volume (V) in CKD patients, and serum biomarkers are not able to replace histomorphometry. Recently, metabolomics has emerged as a new technique that could allow for the identification of new biomarkers useful for disease diagnosis or for the understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms, but it has never been assessed in the chronic kidney disease–mineral and bone disorder (CKD–MBD) scenario. In this study, we investigated the association between serum metabolites and the bone TMV classification in patients with end-stage renal disease by using serum NMR spectroscopy and bone biopsy of 49 hemodialysis patients from a single center in Brazil. High T was identified in 21 patients and was associated with higher levels of dimethylsulfone, glycine, citrate, and N-acetylornithine. The receiver-operating characteristic curve for the combination of PTH and these metabolites provided an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.86 (0.76 to 0.97). Abnormal M was identified in 30 patients and was associated with lower ethanol. The AUC for age, diabetes mellitus, and ethanol was 0.83 (0.71 to 0.96). Low V was identified in 17 patients and was associated with lower carnitine. The association of age, phosphate, and carnitine provided an AUC of 0.83 (0.70 to 0.96). Although differences among the curves by adding selected metabolites to traditional models were not statistically significant, the accuracy of the diagnosis according to the TMV classification seemed to be improved. This is the first study to evaluate the TMV classification system in relation to the serum metabolome assessed by NMR spectroscopy, showing that selected metabolites may help in the evaluation of bone phenotypes in CKD–MBD. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Each year, 4.3 million pregnant women are exposed to malaria risk in Latin America and the Caribbean. Plasmodium vivax causes 76% of the regional malaria burden and appears to be less affected than P. falciparum by current elimination efforts. This is in part due to the parasi-te’s ability to stay dormant in the liver and originate relapses within months after a single mos-quito inoculation. Primaquine (PQ) is routinely combined with chloroquine (CQ) or other schizontocidal drugs to supress P. vivax relapses and reduce the risk of late blood-stage recrudescences of parasites with low-grade CQ resistance. However, PQ is contraindicated for pregnant women, who remain at increased risk of repeated infections following CQ-only treatment. Here we apply a mathematical model to time-to-recurrence data from Juruá Val-ley, Brazil0 s main malaria transmission hotspot, to quantify the extra burden of parasite recurrences attributable to PQ ineligibility in pregnant women. The model accounts for competing risks, since relapses and late recrudescences (that may be at least partially prevented by PQ) and new infections (that are not affected by PQ use) all contribute to recurrences. We compare recurrence rates observed after primary P. vivax infections in 158 pregnant women treated with CQ only and 316 P. vivax infections in non-pregnant control women, matched for age, date of infection, and place of residence, who were administered a standard CQ-PQ combination. We estimate that, once infected with P. vivax, 23% of the pregnant women have one or more vivax malaria recurrences over the next 12 weeks; 86% of these early P. vivax recurrences are attributable to relapses or late recrudescences, rather than new infections that could be prevented by reducing malaria exposure during pregnancy. Model simulations indicate that weekly CQ chemoprophylaxis extending over 4 to 12 weeks, starting after the first vivax malaria episode diagnosed in pregnancy, might reduce the risk of P. vivax recurrences over the next 12 months by 20% to 65%. We conclude that post-treatment CQ prophylaxis could be further explored as a measure to prevent vivax malaria recurrences in pregnancy and avert their adverse effects on maternal and neonatal health. © 2020 Corder et al.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is one of the main causes of death due to cardiomyopathy and heart failure in Latin American countries. The treatment of Chagas disease is directed at eliminating the parasite, decreasing the probability of cardiomyopathy and disrupting the disease transmission cycle. Benznidazole (BZ) and nifurtimox (Nfx) are recognized as effective drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease by the World Health Organization, but both have high toxicity and limited efficacy, especially in the chronic disease phase. At low doses, aspirin (ASA) has been reported to protect against T. cruzi infection. We evaluated the effectiveness of BZ in combination with ASA at low doses during the acute disease phase and evaluated cardiovascular aspects and cardiac lesions in the chronic phase. ASA treatment prevented the cardiovascular dysfunction (hypertension and tachycardia) and typical cardiac lesions. Moreover, BZ ASA-treated mice had a smaller cardiac fibrotic area than BZ-treated mice. These results were associated with an increase in numbers of eosinophils and reticulocytes and levels of nitric oxide in the plasma and cardiac tissue of ASA-treated mice relative to respective controls. These effects of ASA and BZ+ASA in chronically infected mice were inhibited by pretreatment with the lipoxin A4 (LXA4) receptor antagonist Boc-2, indicating that the protective effects of ASA are mediated by ASA-triggered lipoxin. These results emphasize the importance of exploring new drug combinations for treatments of the acute phase of Chagas disease that are beneficial for patients with chronic disease.

AB  - Background: The subgenus Megatrypanum Hoare, 1964 of Trypanosoma Gruby, 1843 comprises trypanosomes of cervids and bovids from around the world. Here, the white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann) and its ectoparasite, the deer ked Lipoptena mazamae Rondani, 1878 (hippoboscid fly), were surveyed for trypanosomes in Venezuela. Results: Haemoculturing unveiled 20% infected WTD, while 47% (7/15) of blood samples and 38% (11/29) of ked guts tested positive for the Megatrypanum-specific TthCATL-PCR. CATL and SSU rRNA sequences uncovered a single species of trypanosome. Phylogeny based on SSU rRNA and gGAPDH sequences tightly cluster WTD trypanosomes from Venezuela and the USA, which were strongly supported as geographical variants of the herein described Trypanosoma (Megatrypanum) trinaperronei n. sp. In our analyses, the new species was closest to Trypanosoma sp. D30 from fallow deer (Germany), both nested into TthII alongside other trypanosomes from cervids (North American elk and European fallow, red and sika deer), and bovids (cattle, antelopes and sheep). Insights into the life-cycle of T. trinaperronei n. sp. were obtained from early haemocultures of deer blood and co-culture with mammalian and insect cells showing flagellates resembling Megatrypanum trypanosomes previously reported in deer blood, and deer ked guts. For the first time, a trypanosome from a cervid was cultured and phylogenetically and morphologically (light and electron microscopy) characterised. Conclusions: In the analyses based on SSU rRNA, gGAPDH, CATL and ITS rDNA sequences, neither cervids nor bovids trypanosomes were monophyletic but intertwined within TthI and TthII major phylogenetic lineages. One host species can harbour more than one species/genotype of trypanosome, but each trypanosome species/genotype was found in a single host species or in phylogenetically closely related hosts. Molecular evidence that L. mazamae may transmit T. trinaperronei n. sp. suggests important evolutionary constraints making tight the tripartite T. trinaperronei-WTD-deer ked association. In a plausible evolutionary scenario, T. trinaperronei n. sp. entered South America with North American white-tailed deer at the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary following the closure of the Panama Isthmus.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi has a high genetic and biological diversity and has been subdivided into seven genetic lineages, named TcI-TcVI and TcBat. DTUs TcI-TcII-TcV and TcVI are agents of ChD in different regions of Latin America. Due to population movements, the disease is an emergent global public health problem. Thus, the aim of this study was to quantify the parasitic load and identify the presence of T. cruzi DTUs in 101 Latin American immigrants with chronic ChD, residing in Barcelona, Spain. Methodology / Principal findings 5ml of peripheral blood were collected in guanidine/EDTA from each patient for DNA extraction, quantification of the parasitic load and genotyping. A great variation of the parasitic load of the patients was verified: from 0.001 to 22.2 T. cruzi DNA (fg) / Blood DNA (ng). In patients from Bolivia the parasitic load was 3.76±4.43 T. cruzi DNA (fg) / Blood DNA (ng) (mean ± SD), in patients of other countries was 0.95±1.38 T. cruzi DNA (fg) / Blood DNA (ng). No statistically significant difference was observed in the parasitic load between patients with the indeterminate and cardiac forms of ChD (p = 0,57). Parasite genotyping was performed by multilocus conventional PCR. In patients from Bolivia there was a nearly equal prevalence of DTUs TcV (27/77), TcII/TcV/TcVI (26/77), and TcII/TcVI (22/77). TcVI was detected in only 2 samples (2/77). A higher prevalence of TcII/TcVI (19/24) was verified in patients of other countries, with low prevalence of TcII/TcV/TcVI (4/24) and TcV (1/24). Conclusions/Significance In this study, low/medium parasitic load was found in all patients evaluated. Our data corroborate previous conclusions indicating that patients from the Bolivia, living in Spain, are predominantly infected by TcV, and TcVI DTUs. On the other hand, in Non-Bolivians patients TcII/TcVI predominated. Surprisingly, in our cohort of 101 patients no infection by TcI DTU was observed. © 2020 Tavares de Oliveira et al.

AB  - The Triatomini tribe consists of ten genera and is regarded as one of the most important tribes from epidemiological point of view. The genus Dipetalogaster Usinger, 1939 is composed only by the species Dipetalogaster maxima Uhler, 1894. This triatomine is exclusive of the Mexico and is a potential vector for Chagas disease. Besides the epidemiological importance, the insects of the Triatominae subfamily are important biological models for cytogenetic studies. Therefore, in order to contribute to the knowledge on the reproductive biology and assist in citotaxonomy of D. maxima, this study aimed to describe spermatogenesis, as well as confirm the karyotype and heterochromatic patterns of this Mexican triatomine species. The seminiferous tubules were torn, fixed to a cover slip and underwent the cytogenetic technique of Lacto-acetic orcein and C-banding. Through the cytogenetics analysis of testicular material D. maxima it was possible to confirm the karyotype (2n = 22), describe the stages of spermatogenesis and characterize the heterochromatic pattern (restricted to sex chromosome Y) of the species. D. maxima showed the same arrangement of heterochromatin described for Triatoma lecticularia (Stål, 1859) (a species that occur in United States of American and Mexico and is phylogenetically related with D. maxima), highlighting the importance of this analysis as an optimization tool to explore phylogenetic correlations. © 2020, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

AB  - Background and objectives: This study provides a longitudinal scientometric analysis of global trypanosomiasis research between 1988 and 2017 as indexed in Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science (WoS). Contributions by researchers from different countries and continents are outlined based on publication productivity, international collaborations, citation analysis, and keyword analysis. Methods: Bibliographic records of research publications indexed by WoS were downloaded based on a broad search of related terms. The authors compared the growth of literature by continent using 5-year increments, conducted a citation and co-authorship analysis by country, and a keyword analysis by publication using the scientometric visualization software VOSviewer. Results: The trypanosomiasis research literature has seen more than a fourfold annual increase in production over the study period. Contributions by authors affiliated with European and South American countries proportionately account for the most research literature. The United States and Brazil, however, occupy central roles for citations and as national contributors to the literature. The terms ‘trypanosomiasis cruzi’ and ‘chagas disease’ have become more prominent, reflecting the regional growth of research from South America. Interpretation and conclusion: Relative contributions from regions where the disease is prevalent show mixed developments. Contributions by African authors have declined proportionately to other areas of the world. However, South American contributions have increased during the study period. The contributing countries to the literature do not necessarily represent regions in which the diseases are prevalent. The same is true of the citation relationships, where European and North American contributions are more frequently cited. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Chagas Disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, with some of the most serious manifestations affecting the cardiovascular system. It is a chronic, stigmatizing condition, closely associated with poverty and affecting close to 6 million people globally. Although historically the disease was limited to endemic areas of Latin America recent years have seen an increasing global spread. In addition to the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease, the social and economic burdens on individuals and society are substantial. Often called the 'silent killer', Chagas disease is characterized by a long, asymptomatic phase in affected individuals. Approximately 30% then go on develop chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy and other serious cardiac complications such as stroke, rhythm disturbances and severe heart failure. Methods: In a collaboration of the World Hearth Federation (WHF) and the Inter-American Society of Cardiology (IASC) a writing group consisting of 20 diverse experts on Chagas disease (CD) was convened. The group provided up to date expert knowledge based on their area of expertise. An extensive review of the literature describing obstacles to diagnosis and treatment of CD along with proposed solutions was conducted. A survey was sent to all WHF Members and, using snowball sampling to widen the consultation, to a variety of health care professionals working in the CD global health community. The results were analyzed, open comments were reviewed and consolidated, and the findings were incorporated into this document, thus ensuring a consensus representation. Results: The WHF IASC Roadmap on Chagas Disease offers a comprehensive summary of current knowledge on prevention, diagnosis and management of the disease. In providing an analysis of 'roadblocks' in access to comprehensive care for Chagas disease patients, the document serves as a framework from which strategies for implementation such as national plans can be formulated. Several dimensions are considered in the analysis: healthcare system capabilities, governance, financing, community awareness and advocacy. Conclusion: The WHF IASC Roadmap proposes strategies and evidence-based solutions for healthcare professionals, health authorities and governments to help overcome the barriers to comprehensive care for Chagas disease patients. This roadmap describes an ideal patient care pathway, and explores the roadblocks along the way, offering potential solutions based on available research and examples in practice. It represents a call to action to decision-makers and health care professionals to step up efforts to eradicate Chagas disease. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by insects of the family Reduviidae. Since conventional treatments with nitroheterocyclic drugs show serious adverse reactions and have questionable efficiency, different research groups have investigated polypeptide-based approaches to interfere with the parasite cell cycle in other Trypanosomatids. These strategies are supported by the fact that surface players are candidates to develop surface ligands that impair function since they may act as virulence factors. In this study, we used a phage display approach to identify peptides from one library-LX8CX8 (17 aa) (where X corresponds to any amino acid). After testing different biopanning conditions using live or fixed epimastigotes, 10 clones were sequenced that encoded the same peptide, named here as EPI18. The bacteriophage expressing EPI18 binds to epimastigotes from distinct strains of T. cruzi. To confirm these results, this peptide was synthetized, biotinylated, and assayed using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy analyses. These assays confirmed the specificity of the binding capacity of EPI18 toward epimastigote surfaces. Our findings suggest that EPI18 may have potential biotechnological applications that include peptide-based strategies to control parasite transmission. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is classified as a neglected disease by the World Health Organization. For clinical treatment, only two drugs have been on the market, Benznidazole and Nifurtimox, both of which are recommended for use in the acute phase but present low cure rates in the chronic phase. Furthermore, strong side effects may result in discontinuation of this treatment. Faced with this situation, we report the synthesis and trypanocidal activity of 3-benzoyl-flavanones. Novel 3-benzoyl-flavanone derivatives were prepared in satisfactory yields in the 3-step synthetic procedure. According to recommended guidelines, the whole cell-based screening methodology was utilized that allowed for the simultaneous use of both parasite forms responsible for human infection. The majority of the tested compounds displayed promising anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity and the most potent flavanone bearing a nitrofuran moiety was more potent than the reference drug, Benznidazole.

AB  - Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, and is transmitted by triatomine insects during its blood meal. Proliferative epimastigotes forms thrive inside the insects in the presence of heme (iron protoporphyrin IX), an abundant product of blood digestion, however little is known about the metabolic outcome of this signaling molecule in the parasite. Trypanosomatids exhibit unusual gene transcription employing a polycistronic transcription mechanism through trans-splicing that regulates its life cycle. Using the Deep Seq transcriptome sequencing we characterized the heme induced transcriptome of epimastigotes and determined that most of the upregulated genes were related to glucose metabolism inside the glycosomes. These results were supported by the upregulation of glycosomal isoforms of PEPCK and fumarate reductase of heme-treated parasites, implying that the fermentation process was favored. Moreover, the downregulation of mitochondrial gene enzymes in the presence of heme also supported the hypothesis that heme shifts the parasite glycosomal glucose metabolism towards aerobic fermentation. These results are examples of the environmental metabolic plasticity inside the vector supporting ATP production, promoting epimastigotes proliferation and survival. © 2020 Paes et al.

AB  - Introduction: After implementing measures to control vector transmission by Triatoma in-festans in Brazil, the number of new cases of Chagas disease (CD) decreased. Currently, the American continent has an annual incidence of 28 000 cases, but a large number of older adults are still affected by the chronic phase of this disease. Objective: To characterize the clinical and epidemiological profile of patients in the chronic phase of CD treated at a reference center located in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted based on the analysis of the medical records of 62 patients in the chronic phase of CD and treated at the Hospital das Clínicas de Marília. Results: No significant differences were found regarding sex, age and time of diagnosis. Cardiac problems were the most reported clinical sign. A significant difference was observed in the case of the indeterminate form of the disease, which was more predominant in males. In addition, functional classification B1 of CD was more common in women, while B2 predominated in men. Conclusion: A late diagnosis of CD may increase the chances of presenting digestive complications. However, the classic manifestations of the disease and its comorbidities can be successfully man-aged as long as comprehensive (multidisciplinary) medical care is provided, since this would help delay the course of the disease and, consequently, improve the patients’ quality of life. © 2020, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

AB  - The etiological agent of American trypanosomiasis is the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi , typically transmitted by triatomines. The aim of this study was to investigate the triatomine fauna and trypanosomiasis infections in Acre State , Western Brazilian Amazon. Insect collection was performed by dissecting palm trees and installing traps. We found that T. cruzi infection rate was 24.5% and Rhodnius pictipes (57.1%) was the most abundant triatomine species. Health education as well as epidemiological and entomological surveillance are necessary to diagnose and prevent new cases of Chagas disease in the region.

AB  - The causative species is an important factor influencing the evolution of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL). Due to its wide distribution in endemic areas, Leishmania (V.) braziliensis is considered one of the most important species in circulation in Brazil. Molecular targets derived from ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were used in studies to identify Leishmania spp.; however, the Intergenic Spacer (IGS) region has not yet been explored in parasite species differentiation. Besides, there is a shortage of sequences deposited in public repositories for this region. Thus, it was proposed to analyze and provide sequences of the IGS rRNA region from different Leishmania spp. and to evaluate their potential as biomarkers to characterize L. braziliensis. A set of primers was designed for complete amplification of the IGS rRNA region of Leishmania spp. PCR products were submitted to Sanger sequencing. The sequences obtained were aligned and analyzed for size and similarity, as well as deposited in GenBank. Characteristics of the repetitive elements (IGSRE) present in the IGS rRNA were also verified. In addition, a set of primers for L. braziliensis identification for qPCR was developed and optimized. Sensitivity (S), specificity (σ), and efficiency (ϵ) tests were applied. It was found that the mean size for the IGS rRNA region is 3 kb, and the similarity analysis of the sequences obtained demonstrated high conservation among the species. It was observed that the size for the IGSRE repetitive region varies between 61 and 71 bp, and there is a high identity between some species. Fifteen sequences generated for the IGS rRNA partial region of nine different species were deposited in GenBank so far. The specific primer system for L. braziliensis showed S=10 fg, ϵ=98.08%, and logσ=103 for Leishmania naiffi; logσ=104 for Leishmania guyanensis; and logσ=105 for Leishmania shawi. This protocol system can be used for diagnosis, identification, and quantification of a patient's parasite load, aiding in the direction of a more appropriate therapeutic management to the cases of infection by this etiological agent. Besides that, the unpublished sequences deposited in databases can be used for multiple analyses in different contexts. © 2020 Tayná C. de Goes et al.

AB  - Chagas disease is an important endemic morbidity in Latin America affecting millions of people in the American continent. It is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, and transmitted through the feces of the insect vector belonging to the subfamily Triatominae. The present conducted an entomological survey of triatomines and analyzed entomological indicators, such as the rate of infestation, colonization, triatomine density and natural infection in rural communities in the municipality of Campinas do Piaui, Piaui State, in the Northeast region of Brazil. Data on the search of triatomines performed in 167 domiciliary units (DUs), harvested during the period of February to July 2019, in 12 rural communities were analyzed. The capture of triatomines occurred in all studied communities, being 76 the number of positive DUs, of the 167 surveyed, presenting a global rate of infestation of 45.51%. Two triatomines species were collected: Triatoma brasiliensis (98.49%) and T. pseudomaculata (1.51%), the first was found in the domiciliary and peridomiciliary areas, while the second was captured only in peridomiciliary areas. The index of colonization was 17.1%. Natural infection was observed only in 5.44% of T. brasiliensis samples. The entomological survey was conducted in rural communities, showingthe risk of transmission of Chagas disease to the local population, requiring continuous entomological surveillance and vector control. © 2020, Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo.

AB  - Introduction: Trypanosoma rangeli is a protozoan that infects several domestic and wild mammals and shows significant distribution in Latin American countries. T. rangeli infection is similar to Chagas disease, both in diagnostic and prophylactic terms. Thus, the objective of this work was to review the diagnostic aspects and use of T. rangeli as an immunogen for Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Methods: For this elaboration, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were adopted with descriptors derived from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) platform in the PubMed/MEDLINE and SciELO databases. The inclusion criteria were defined as original articles on "Trypanosoma rangeli" and diagnostic aspects of T. rangeli infection in humans and/or research on the possible vaccines developed using T. rangeli strains for T. cruzi infection. Results: After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 18 articles were procured, of which 4 addressed research on the possible vaccines developed using T. rangeli for T. cruzi infection in vertebrates and the remaining 14 predominantly dealt with the diagnostic aspects of T. rangeli infection in humans. Conclusions: In this study, we formulated a compilation of the essential literature on this subject, emphasizing the need for more accurate and accessible techniques for the differential diagnosis of infections caused by both protozoa, and underscored several prospects in the search for a vaccine for Chagas disease. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

AB  - BACKGROUND Chagas disease, resulting from Trypanosoma cruzi infections, continues to be a health concern mainly in Latin American countries where the parasite is endemic. The laboratory diagnosis of a chronic infection is determined through serological assays for antibodies against T. cruzi and several tests are available that differ in key components, formats and methodologies. To date, no single test meets the criteria of a gold standard. The situation is further complicated by the difficulties associated with performance comparisons between different immunoassays or methodologies executed at different times and geographical areas. OBJECTIVE To improve the diagnosis of Chagas disease, the WHO coordinated the development of two International Biological Reference Standards for antibodies against anti-T. cruzi: NIBSC 09/186 and NIBSC 09/188 that respectively represent geographical regions with the highest prevalence of TcII and TcI lineages of the parasite. METHODS The principle goal of this study was to verify the behavior of these standards when assayed by several commercially available serological tests that employ different methods to capture and detect human anti-T. cruzi antibodies. FINDINGS AND MAIN CONCLUSIONS The results reinforce the recommendation that these standards be considered for performance evaluations of commercialised immunoassays and should be an integral step in the development of new test components or assay paradigms. © 2020, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

AB  - Oral transmission of Chagas disease has been increasing in Latin American countries. The present study aimed to investigate changes in hepatic function, coagulation factor levels and parasite load in human acute Chagas disease (ACD) secondary to oral Trypanosoma cruzi transmission. Clinical and epidemiological findings of 102 infected individuals attended in the State of Pará from October 2013 to February 2016 were included. The most common symptoms were fever (98%), asthenia (83.3%), face and limb edema (80.4%), headache (74.5%) and myalgia (72.5%). The hepatic enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 30 ACD patients were higher compared with controls, and this increase was independent of the treatment with benznidazole. Moreover, ACD individuals had higher plasma levels of activated protein C and lower levels of factor VII of the coagulation cascade. Patients with the highest parasite load had also the most increased transaminase levels. Also, ALT and AST were associated moderately (r = 0.429) and strongly (r = 0.595) with parasite load respectively. In conclusion, the present study raises the possibility that a disturbance in coagulation and hepatic function may be linked to human ACD. © 2020, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease, also known as American Trypanosomiasis, is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. It is occurring in Americas, including USA and Canada, and Europe and its current treatment involves the use of two drugs as follows: benznidazole (BNZ) and nifurtimox, which present high toxicity and low efficacy during the chronic phase of the disease, thus promoting the search for more effective therapeutic alternatives. Amongst them xylan, a bioactive polysaccharide, extracted from corn cob. Methods: Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FITR), Raman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), dynamic light scattering (DLS) have been used to characterize the silver-xylan nanoparticles (NX). Their cytotoxicity was evaluated with 3-bromo(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) test. MTT and flow cytometry were used to ascertain the anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity. Results: UV-Vis spectroscopy gave plasmon resonance ranging between 400 and 450 nm while FITC and Raman spectroscopy proved nano interface functionalized with xylan. ICP-OES data showed NX with xylan (81%) and silver (19%). EDS showed NX consisting of carbon (59.4%), oxygen (26.2%) and silver (4.8%) main elements. Spherical NX of 55 nm average size has been depicted with SEM and AFM, while DLS showed 102 ± 1.7 nm NX. The NX displayed negligible cytotoxicity (2000 µg/mL). NX (100 µg/mL) was more effective, regardless of experiment time, in affecting the ability of parasites to reduce MTT than BZN (100 µg/mL). In addition, NX (100 µg/mL) induced death of 95% of parasites by necrosis. Conclusion: This is the first time silver nanoparticles are presented as an anti-Trypanosoma cruzi agent and the data point to the potential application of NX to new preclinical studies in vitro and in vivo. © 2020 Brito et al.

AB  - Vector transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi occurs in several areas of Brazil, including the northeastern region, and domestic animals can serve as reservoirs of the parasite. The aim of this study was to monitor dogs as domestic reservoirs for infection by T. cruzi, and the main triatomine species involved in parasite transmission in rural areas of municipalities in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, in northeastern, Brazil. Blood samples from dogs (n = 40) and manual triatomine capture were performed in domiciliary and peridomiciliary environments in rural areas of the towns of Acari, Caraúbas and Marcelino Vieira, between 2013 and 2016. Subsequently, infection of dogs was determined by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the detection of IgM and IgG isotypes and Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) reactions for detection of IgG. Triatomine infection was determined by PCR. Forty (16/40) percent of the dogs were seropositive for T. cruzi; 20.0% (8/40) of such reactivity indicated the acute phase, and 20.0% (8/40), the chronic phase. PCR was positive in 42.5% (17/40) of the dogs’ blood samples. Specimens of Triatoma brasiliensis, Triatoma pseudomaculata, Rhodnius nasutus and Panstrongylus lutzi were found to be infected; however only T. brasiliensis nymphs and adults were infected in both environments. Triatomines evaluation showed 82.5% (94/114) of PCR positivity. Taken together, our results confirm that dogs are domestic reservoirs of T. cruzi in northeastern Brazil and T. brasiliensis is the main triatomine species correlated with parasite transmission in domiciliary environments. There is a continuing need to control peridomiciliary populations of triatomines and to implement continuous surveillance strategies for reservoirs with the help from the community. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - CD43 (leukosialin) is a large sialoglycoprotein abundantly expressed on the surface of most cells from the hematopoietic lineage. CD43 is directly involved in the contact between cells participating in a series of events such as signaling, adherence and host parasite interactions. In this study we examined the role of CD43 in the immune response against Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan parasite that causes Chagas’ disease, a potential life-threatening illness endemic in 21 Latin American countries according to the WHO. The acute stage of infection is marked by intense parasitemia and cardiac tissue parasitism, resulting in the recruitment of inflammatory cells and acute damage to the heart tissue. We show here that CD43−/− mice were more resistant to infection due to increased cytotoxicity of antigen specific CD8+ T cells and reduced inflammatory infiltration in the cardiac tissue, both contributing to lower cardiomyocyte damage. In addition, we demonstrate that the induction of acute myocarditis involves the engagement of CD43 cytoplasmic tripeptide sequence KRR to ezrin-radixin-moiesin cytoskeletal proteins. Together, our results show the participation of CD43 in different events involved in the pathogenesis of T. cruzi infection, contributing to a better overall understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of acute chagasic cardiomyopathy. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is an arrhythmogenic disorder of the myocardium not secondary to ischemic, hypertensive, or valvular heart disease. ACM incorporates a broad spectrum of genetic, systemic, infectious, and inflammatory disorders. This designation includes, but is not limited to, arrhythmogenic right/left ventricular cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, Chagas disease, and left ventricular noncompaction. The ACM phenotype overlaps with other cardiomyopathies, particularly dilated cardiomyopathy with arrhythmia presentation that may be associated with ventricular dilatation and/or impaired systolic function. This expert consensus statement provides the clinician with guidance on evaluation and management of ACM and includes clinically relevant information on genetics and disease mechanisms. PICO questions were utilized to evaluate contemporary evidence and provide clinical guidance related to exercise in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Recommendations were developed and approved by an expert writing group, after a systematic literature search with evidence tables, and discussion of their own clinical experience, to present the current knowledge in the field. Each recommendation is presented using the Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence system formulated by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association and is accompanied by references and explanatory text to provide essential context. The ongoing recognition of the genetic basis of ACM provides the opportunity to examine the diverse triggers and potential common pathway for the development of disease and arrhythmia. © 2019 Heart Rhythm Society

AB  - Introduction: As benznidazole is the first-line treatment for patients with Chagas disease, rational chemotherapy strategies are required based on the critical analysis of the evidence on the relevance and applicability of this drug at different disease stages. Areas covered: The authors discuss the current understanding of benznidazole-based chemotherapy for Chagas disease, focusing specifically on epidemiology, pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action, clinical recommendations, cure criteria, and therapeutic efficacy in different phases of the disease. Expert opinion: Benznidazole shows high bioavailability after oral administration. Benznidazole at 5–8 mg/kg/day and 5–10 mg/kg/day for 30–60 days are consistent clinical recommendations for children and adults, respectively. A high correlation between negative parasitological, serological, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays in long-term post-therapeutic follow-up has been consistently used to evaluate therapeutic efficacy. These methods support the evidence that the success of benznidazole-based chemotherapy is closely correlated with the phase of infection in which the treatment is administered. The greater therapeutic efficacy is obtained in acute infections, gradually worsening as the infection becomes chronic. When therapeutic failure is confirmed by any diagnostic assay, benznidazole treatment does not always ensure better long-term prognosis, and Chagas cardiomyopathy may develop as well as in untreated patients. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background:Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has become the preferred alternative treatment to standard Heller myotomy for patients with esophageal achalasia, in Latin American countries. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a POEM in the management of achalasia with and without Chagas disease in patients receiving POEM.Methods:Patients who underwent POEM from tertiary centers in Latin America were included in a dedicated registry. Countries included Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. Patients enrolled needed to have a preoperative manometry and swallow contrast study confirming achalasia. Clinical success was defined as significant improvement in Eckardt score after therapy.Results:POEM was technically successful in 81/89 (91%) patients (mean age, 44 y). There was a significant decrease in preprocedure and postprocedure Eckardt score from 8.7 (range, 3 to 12) to 2.15 (0 to 10) (P<0.001), preprocedure and postprocedure barium swallow evaluation (98% vs. 89%; P=0.017), and preprocedure and postprocedure lower esophageal sphincter pressure measurement (from 35 to 13.8 mm Hg; P<0.001). Clinical success was achieved in 93% of patients. Patients with Chagas disease (n=58) were 9.5 times more likely to respond to POEM (P=0.0020; odds ratio, 9.5).Conclusions:POEM is an efficacious and safe therapeutic modality for treatment of achalasia in Latin America. Chagas disease-related achalasia seems to particularly respond better to POEM when it is performed by experienced endoscopists. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and is endemic in many Latin American countries. Diagnosis is based on serologic testing and the WHO recommends two or more serological tests for confirmation. Acidic ribosomal P protein of T. cruzi showed strong reactivity against positive sera of patients, and we cloned the protein after fragmenting it to enhance its antigenicity and solubility. Twelve positive sera of Chagas disease patients were reacted with the fragmented ribosomal P protein using western blot. Detection rate and density for each fragment were determined. Fragments F1R1, F1R2, and F2R1 showed 100% rate of detection, and average density scoring of 2.00, 1.67, and 2.42 from a maximum of 3.0, respectively. Therefore, the F2R1 fragment of the ribosomal P protein of T. cruzi could be a promising antigen to use in the diagnosis of Chagas disease in endemic regions with high specificity and sensitivity. © 2019, Korean Society for Parasitology and Tropical Medicine.

AB  - Chagas disease is a important public health problem throughout America, extended worldwide, both by external and internal migrations, with heart failure being one of the most serious complications of chagasic cardiomyopathy, with severe repercussions on both the individual and his family, not only with involvement in the quality of life, but with a significant number of cardiological complications such as severe and complex arrhythmias, strokes and even sudden death. As well, It is expensive in medical treatments, hospitalizations, use of electronic devices; transplants, etc. A group of Latin American experts have made an update based on their experience accompanied by an important bibliographic review in order to update the usual clinical and complementary diagnoses and of high complexity, as well as the treatments currently available for this complication, and they must be adapted to the availability of health care centers. © 2019 SilverHorse.

AB  - Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) is an important group of cryptogenic strokes that are in evidence due recent ongoing trials. We reviewed medical records at discharge from the stroke unit of all patients who met ESUS criteria and attended our institution between February 2016 and July 2017. Among 550 stroke patients, 51 had ESUS. We found that hypertension (60%), diabetes mellitus (34%), and smoking (36%) were the most prevalent risk factors. The mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores were 7 at admission and 4 at discharge, while median scores on the modified Rankin scale were 0 and 2 at admission and discharge, respectively. Our sample had similar ages, risk factors prevalence and NIHSS scores at admission and discharge when compared with European and North American cohorts. Although a small cohort, our study suggests that the ESUS population is similar in countries with different health financing. © 2019, Associacao Arquivos de Neuro-Psiquiatria. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Laboratory diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease is a troubling factor due to lack of reference tests. The WHO suggests the use of two distinct commercial serological tests in parallel. The performance of commercial immunoassays might fluctuate depending on the antigenic matrices and the local strains of T. cruzi in different geographical settings. The use of antigenic matrices based on chimeric proteins can solve these limitations. Here, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of two chimeric T. cruzi antigens (IBMP-8.1 and -8.4) to diagnose chronic Chagas disease in individuals from endemic South American countries. Methodology/Principal findings IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens were expressed as soluble proteins in E. coli and purified using chromatography methods. Reactivity of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 was assessed using an in-house ELISA with sera from 122 non-infected and 215 T. cruzi-infected individuals from Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. Cut-off values were based on ROC curves and performance parameters were determined using a dichotomous approach. Area under the curve values were > 99.7% for both IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 antigens. IgG levels in T. cruzi-positive and negative samples were higher for IBMP-8.4 than IBMP-8.1. Both IBMP-8.1 and -8.4 were 100% specific, while IBMP-8.4 were 100% sensitive compared to IBMP-8.1 (95.3%). Admitting RI values of 1.0 ± 0.10 as the inconclusive interval, 6.2% of the samples tested using IBMP-8.1 and 2.1% using IBMP-8.4 fell inside the grey zone. Based on accuracy and diagnostic odds ratio values, IBMP-8.4 presented the best performance. Differences in sensitivity and IgG levels among the samples from Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay were not significant. Conclusions/Significance Our findings showed a notable performance of IBMP-8.1 and -8.4 chimeric antigens in diagnosing chronic Chagas disease in individuals from endemic South American countries, confirming our hypothesis that these antigens could be used in geographical areas where distinct T. cruzi DTUs occur. © 2019 Del-Rei et al.

AB  - More than 100 years after being first described, Chagas disease remains endemic in 21 Latin American countries and has spread to other continents. Indeed, this disease, which is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is no longer just a problem for the American continents but has become a global health threat. Current therapies, i.e., nifurtimox and benznidazole (Bz), are far from being adequate, due to their undesirable effects and their lack of efficacy in the chronic phases of the disease. In this work, we present an in-depth phenotypic evaluation in T. cruzi of a new class of imidazole compounds, which were discovered in a previous phenotypic screen against different trypanosomatids and were designed as potential inhibitors of cAMP phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The confirmation of several activities similar or superior to that of Bz prompted a synthesis program of hit optimization and extended structure-activity relationship aimed at improving drug-like properties such as aqueous solubility, which resulted in additional hits with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values similar to that of Bz. The cellular effects of one representative hit, compound 9, on bloodstream trypomastigotes were further investigated. Transmission electron microscopy revealed cellular changes, after just 2 h of incubation with the IC50 concentration, that were consistent with induced autophagy and osmotic stress, mechanisms previously linked to cAMP signaling. Compound 9 induced highly significant increases in both cellular and medium cAMP levels, confirming that inhibition of T. cruzi PDE(s) is part of its mechanism of action. The potent and selective activity of this imidazole-based PDE inhibitor class against T. cruzi constitutes a successful repurposing of research into inhibitors of mammalian PDEs.

AB  - Background: Chronic Chagas Disease (CD) diagnosis is based on serological methods employing crude, semipurified or recombinant antigens, which may result in low sensitivity or cross-reactivity. To reduce these restrictions, we developed a strategy involving use of molecules containing repetitive fragments of Trypanosoma cruzi conserved proteins. Diagnostic performance of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens (Molecular Biology Institute of Paraná - IBMP in Portuguese acronym) was assessed to diagnose T. cruzi-infected and non-infected immigrants living in Barcelona (Spain), a non-endemic setting for Chagas disease. Methods: Reactivity of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 was assessed using an in-house automated ELISA with 347 positive and 331 negative individuals to Chagas disease. Antigenic cross-reactivity was measured with sera samples from pregnant women with Toxoplasma gondii (n = 98) and Zika virus (n = 75) antibodies. Results: The area under the curve values was 1 and 0.99 for the IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 proteins, respectively, demonstrating excellent diagnostic accuracy. The reactivity index was higher for IBMP-8.1 than IBMP-8.4 in positive samples and no significant difference in reactivity index was observed in negative samples. Sensitivity ranged from 99.4% for IBMP-8.1 to 99.1% for IBMP-8.4 and was not statistically different. Specificity for IBMP-8.1 reached 100 and 99.7% for IBMP-8.4, both nearly 100% accurate. No antigenic cross-reactivity was observed and reactivity index was similar to that for negative Chagas disease individuals. Conclusions: Our results showed an outstanding performance of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens by ELISA and suggest both chimeric antigens could also be used for Chagas disease diagnosis in immigrants living in non-endemic settings. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Chagas disease continues to be an important cause of morbidity, mortality and disability in several Latin American countries, including Brazil. Using findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD, 2016), we present years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life years due to Chagas disease in Brazil, by sex, age group, and Brazilian states, from 1990 to 2016. Results are reported in absolute numbers and age-standardized rates (per 100,000 population) with 95% uncertainty intervals. In 2016, 141,640 disability-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty intervals: 129,065–155,941) due to Chagas disease were estimated in Brazil, with a relative reduction of 36.7% compared with 1990 (223,879 disability-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty intervals: 209,372–238,591)). Age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rates declined at the national level (−69.7%) and in all Brazilian states between 1990 and 2016, but with different regional patterns. The decrease in the disability-adjusted life year rates was driven primarily by a consistent reduction in the years of life lost rates, the main component of total disability-adjusted life years for Chagas disease. The highest fatal and non-fatal burden due to Chagas disease was observed among males, the elderly, and in those Brazilian states encompassing important endemic areas for vector transmission in the past. Despite the consistent reduction in its burden during the period, Chagas disease is still an important and neglected cause of health lost due to premature mortality and disability in Brazil. Efforts should be made to maintain the political interest and sustainability of surveillance and control actions for Chagas disease, prevent the risk of re-emergence of vector transmission in endemic areas, and provide health care to chronically infected individuals, including early diagnosis and treatment interventions. © 2019 Australian Society for Parasitology

AB  - Introduction: Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease (CD), a zoonotic infection transmitted by triatomine bug vectors to human beings. Although the story of this parasitic infection was born in Brazil and here this has made major step forward information, the same cannot be said about the actual distribution of the triatomine vector in several areas of this country. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of triatomine species in an endemic region for CD in Northeastern Brazil. Methods: A retrospective study was performed using data obtained from 2008 to 2017. All information was provided by the V Gerência Regional de Saúde of the state of Pernambuco. The spatial distribution of triatomine species was analyzed by drawing a map using the Quantum geographic information system. Results: A total of 4,694 triatomine specimens (469.4 ± 221.2 per year) were collected during the period 2008-2017, with 94.5% (4,434/4,694) at the intradomicile and 5.5% (260/4,694) at peridomicile environment. Of all arthropods collected, 92.5% (4,340/4,694) and 7.5% (354/4,694) were adults and nymphs, respectively. The species most frequently detected were Panstrongylus lutzi (30.36%), Triatoma brasiliensis (26.12%), Triatoma pseudomaculata (22.43%), and Panstrongylus megistus (20.54%). Conclusions: These data contribute to a better understanding of the distribution of T. cruzi infection in the Northeastern region of Brazil. Preventive measures based on vector control should be implemented in the study area in order to reduce the burden this neglected tropical disease. © 2019, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

AB  - American Tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) is an infectious disease caused by several species of Leishmania. Even though the direct detection of parasites has low sensitivity, it is still the gold standard for the laboratory diagnosis of ATL. Recent studies have shown promising results of Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) using recombinant antigens. The aim of this study is to compare the accuracy of ELISAs using novel antigens with the standard ELISA based on soluble antigens of Leishmania (SLA) to diagnose ATL. Studies that analyzed patients with ATL and studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of ELISAs using novel antigens and SLA were included. The Fourteen studies from PubMed, Regional Portal of the Virtual Health Library (BVS), Brazilian Society of Dermatology, Virtual Health Library (IBECS), Literature in the Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean (LILACS), Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (Medline), Elsevier Embase, Cochrane Library, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were included. The novel ELISA antigens showed a high sensitivity (93.8%-100%) and specificity (82.5‑100%), a better diagnostic performance than SLA-based ELISAs (1-97.4% and 57.5‑100%, respectively). Only 10 studies analyzed cross-reactions in serum samples from patients with Chagas disease, and only two studies reported a percentage of cross-reactivity. In this systematic review, the novel ELISA antigens showed better sensitivity and specificity with respect to SLA-based ELISAs. However, a meta-analysis should be performed to confirm this finding. © 2019, Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: American trypanosomiasis, also known as Chagas disease, is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) and affects approximately 10 to 12 million, primarily in Latin America. Since its discovery in 1909, there is no effective treatment for its chronic phase, with benzonidazole being the only anti-trypanosoma drug used in Brazil, despite the absence of conclusive evidence to prove its efficacy and safety. Thus, it is necessary to develop new drugs that are more effective and selective against Trypanosoma cruzi. Methods: The T. cruzi enzyme Trypanothione Reductase (TcTR) is a validated target for the discovery of new antiprotozoal compounds and we employed the Virtual Screening technique on the database of Nucleus of Bioassays, Biosynthesis and Ecophysiology (NuBBE), aiming to search for new chemical moieties against T. cruzi. From these we selected the 10 best ligand energies interactions and verified their interaction profile with the main TcTR sites through the AuPosSOM server (https://www.biomedicale.univ-paris5.fr/aupossom). Results and Conclusion: Finally, we analyzed some pharmacokinetics and toxicological information through the servers Aggregator Advisor (http://advisor.bkslab.org), Pred-hERG 4.0 (http://labmol.com.br/predherg) and pkCSM (http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/pkcsm/prediction) which we expect will be useful in in vitro preclinical trials. © 2019, Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Chimeric T. cruzi antigens have been proposed as a diagnostic tool for chronic Chagas disease (CD) in both settings where Chagas disease is endemic and those where it is not endemic. Antibody response varies in accordance to each T. cruzi strain, presenting challenges to the use of antigens lacking demonstrated cross-reactivity with Leishmania spp. Our group expressed four chimeric proteins (IBMP-8.1, IBMP-8.2, IBMP-8.3, and IBMP-8.4) and previously assessed their diagnostic performance to determine cross-reactivity with Leishmania spp. Here, we validated our findings using serum samples from different Brazilian geographic areas reporting endemic Chagas disease, endemic visceral or American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL), or both. Overall, 829 serum samples were evaluated using commercial and IBMP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Due to the absence of a reference assay to diagnosis CD, latent class analysis (LCA) was performed through the use of a statistical model. The incidence of cross-reactivity for ACL-positive samples varied from 0.35% (IBMP-8.3) to 0.70% (IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.2). Regarding visceral leishmaniasis (VL)-positive samples, the IBMP-8.2 and IBMP-8.3 antigens cross-reacted with six (3.49%) and with only one sample (0.58%), respectively. No cross-reactivity with either ACL or VL was observed for the IBMP-8.4 antigen. Similarly, no cross-reactions were found when VL-positive samples were assayed with IBMP-8.1. The agreement among the results obtained using IBMP antigens ranged from 97.3% for IBMP-8.2 and 99% for IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.3 to 100% for IBMP-8.4, demonstrating almost perfect agreement with LCA. Accordingly, in light of the negligible cross-reactivity with both ACL and VL, we suggest the use of IBMP antigens in regions where T. cruzi and Leishmania spp. are coendemic.

AB  - Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. This disease is distributed in 21 Latin American countries, where it is mostly vector-borne. In Brazil, there are 68 triatomine species. To date, the epidemiological surveys indicate that the state of São Paulo presents 11 species of triatomines, and most of these species have already been collected in a home environment and found to be infected with T. cruzi. Problems in correctly identifying species can lead to incorrect panorama of distribution of Chagas disease vectors. Thus, we developed an identification key for the triatomines of the state of São Paulo, based on cytogenetic data. With the exception of Panstrongylus diasi that does not present cytogenetic data available in the literature, all species were differentiated by cytogenetic characteristics. We emphasize the importance of using this key as a simple and objective tool in the entoepidemiological surveys conducted by the vector control programs. © 2019 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB  - Oral transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is presently the most important route of infection in Brazilian Amazon. Other South American countries have also reported outbreaks of acute Chagas disease associated with food consumption. A conspicuous feature of this route of transmission is presenting symptoms such as facial and lower limbs edema, in some cases bleeding manifestations and risk of thromboembolism are evident. Notwithstanding, studies that address this route of infection are largely lacking regarding its pathogenesis and, more specifically, the crosstalk between immune and hemostatic systems. Here, BALB/c mice were orally infected with metacyclic trypomastigotes of T. cruzi Tulahuén strain and used to evaluate the cytokine response, primary and secondary hemostasis during acute T. cruzi infection. When compared with control uninfected animals, orally infected mice presented higher pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-6) serum levels. The highest concentrations were obtained concomitantly to the increase of parasitemia, between 14 and 28 days post-infection (dpi). Blood counts in the oral infected group revealed concomitant leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia, the latter resulting in increased bleeding at 21 dpi. Hematological changes paralleled with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, Factor VIII consumption and increased D-dimer levels, suggest that oral T. cruzi infection relies on disseminated intravascular coagulation. Remarkably, blockade of the IL-6 receptor blunted hematological abnormalities, revealing a critical role of IL-6 in the course of oral infection. These results unravel that acute T. cruzi oral infection results in significant alterations in the hemostatic system and indicates the relevance of the crosstalk between inflammation and hemostasis in this parasitic disease.

AB  - Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is classified as one of the 17 most important neglected diseases by the World Health Organization. The only drugs with proven efficacy against Chagas disease are benznidazole and nifurtimox, however both show adverse effects, poor clinical efficacy, and development of resistance. For these reasons, the search for new effective chemical entities is a challenge to research groups and the pharmaceutical industry. Objective: Synthesis and evaluation of antitrypanosomal activities of a series of thiosemicarbazones and semicarbazones containing 1,2,3-1H triazole isatin scaffold. Method: 5'-(4-alkyl/aryl)-1H-1,2,3-triazole-isatins were prepared by Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and the thiosemicarbazones and semicarbazones were obtained by the 1:1 reactions of the carbonylated derivatives with thiosemicarbazide and semicarbazide hydrochloride, respectively, in methanol, using conventional reflux or microwave heating. The compounds were assayed for in vitro trypanocidal activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease. Beyond the thio/semicarbazone derivatives, isatin and triazole synthetic intermediates were also evaluated for comparison. Results: A series of compounds were prepared in good yields. Among the 37 compounds evaluated, 18 were found to be active, in particular thiosemicarbazones containing a non-polar saturated alkyl chain (IC50 = 24.1, 38.6, and 83.2 µM; SI = 11.6, 11.8, and 14.0, respectively). To further elucidate the mechanism of action of these new compounds, the redox behaviour of some active and inactive derivatives was studied by cyclic voltammetry. Molecular docking studies were also performed in two validated protein targets of Trypanosoma cruzi, i.e., cruzipain (CRZ) and phosphodiesterase C (TcrPDEC). Conclusion: A class of thio/semicarbazones structurally simple and easily accessible was synthesized. Compounds containing thiosemicarbazone moieties showed the best results in the series, being more active than the corresponding semicarbazones. Our results indicated that the activity of these compounds does not originate from an oxidation-reduction pathway but probably from the interactions with trypanosomal enzymes. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - American trypanosomiasis is transmitted to humans by triatomine bugs through the ingestion of contaminated food, by blood transfusions or accidently in hospitals and research laboratories. In addition, the Trypanosoma cruzi infection is transmitted congenitally from a chagasic mother to her offspring, but the male partner’s contribution to in utero contamination is unknown. The findings of nests and clumps of amastigotes and of trypomastigotes in the theca cells of the ovary, in the goniablasts and in the lumen of seminiferous tubules suggest that T. cruzi infections are sexually transmitted. The research protocol herein presents the results of a family study population showing parasite nuclear DNA in the diploid blood mononuclear cells and in the haploid gametes of human subjects. Thus, three independent biological samples collected one year apart confirmed that T. cruzi infections were sexually transmitted to progeny. Interestingly, the specific T. cruzi antibody was absent in the majority of family progeny that bore immune tolerance to the parasite antigen. Immune tolerance was demonstrated in chicken refractory to T. cruzi after the first week of embryonic growth, and chicks hatched from the flagellate-inoculated eggs were unable to produce the specific antibody. Moreover, the instillation of the human semen ejaculates intraperitoneally or into the vagina of naive mice yielded T. cruzi amastigotes in the epididymis, seminiferous tubule, vas deferens and uterine tube with an absence of inflammatory reactions in the immune privileged organs of reproduction. The breeding of T. cruzi-infected male and female mice with naive mates resulted in acquisition of the infections, which were later transmitted to the progeny. Therefore, a robust education, information and communication program that involves the population and social organizations is deemed necessary to prevent Chagas disease. © 2019 Journal of Visualized Experiments.

AB  - Chagas disease is caused by the hemoflagellate protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi and is one of the most important neglected tropical diseases, especially in Latin American countries, where there is an association between low-income populations and mortality. The nitroderivatives used in current chemotherapy are far from ideal and present severe limitations, justifying the continuous search for alternative drugs. Since the1990s, our group has been investigating the trypanocidal activity of natural naphthoquinones and their derivatives, and three naphthoimidazoles (N1, N2 and N3) derived from β-lapachone were found to be most effective in vitro. Analysis of their mechanism of action via cellular, molecular and proteomic approaches indicates that the parasite mitochondrion contains one of the primary targets of these compounds, trypanothione synthetase (involved in trypanothione production), which is overexpressed after treatment with these compounds. Here, we further evaluated the participation of the mitochondria and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the anti-T. cruzi action of naphthoimidazoles. Preincubation of epimastigotes and trypomastigotes with antioxidants (α-tocopherol and urate) strongly protected the parasites from the trypanocidal effect of naphthoimidazoles, decreasing the ROS levels produced and reverting the mitochondrial swelling phenotype. The addition of pro-oxidants (menadione and H2O2) before the treatment induced an increase in parasite lysis. Despite the O2 uptake and mitochondrial complex activity being strongly reduced by N1, N2 and N3, urate partially restored the mitochondrial metabolism only in N1-treated parasites. In parallel, MitoTEMPO, a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, protected the functionality of the mitochondria in N2- and N3-treated parasites. In addition, the trypanothione reductase activity was remarkably increased after treatment with N1 and N3, and molecular docking demonstrated that these two compounds were positioned in pockets of this enzyme. Based on our findings, the direct impairment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain by N2 and N3 led to an oxidative misbalance, which exacerbated ROS generation and led to parasite death. Although other mechanisms cannot be discounted, mainly in N1-treated parasites, further investigations are required. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Serological tests are important tools for the diagnosis of Leishmania infection. However, they are not effective markers to diagnose asymptomatic cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and patients developing tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL), since antileishmanial antibodies can be encountered in low levels resulting in false-negative results in the serological trials. In this context, antigens able to be recognized by antibodies in sera from both VL and TL patients will be desirable to be employed in a more sensitivity and specific diagnosis of disease. In the present study, a conserved Leishmania protein, small myristoylated protein-3 (SMP-3), which was showed to be conserved in different Leishmania species and an effective vaccine candidate against Leishmania infantum infection in a murine model, was cloned and the recombinant protein was evaluated as a serological marker for the diagnosis of human TL and canine VL. In addition, a linear B cell-specific epitope (MQKDEESGEFKCEL) was identified, synthetized and also investigated as a serological marker. As antigen controls, rA2 protein and antigenic Leishmania extracts (SLA) were used. Results showed that ELISA-rSMP-3 and ELISA-Peptide presented sensitivity and specificity values higher than 90% in both diseases in humans and canids, having identified all asymptomatic cases and did not present cross-reaction with cross-reactivity diseases in both mammalian hosts. On the other hand, sensitivity and specificity values were worst when rA2 or SLA were used as antigens in humans and dogs. In conclusion, results showed the efficacy and Leishmania SMP-3 protein, employed as a recombinant antigen or a B cell epitope, for the improvement of the serodiagnosis of human TL and canine VL. This candidate can be tested in other diagnostic platforms, such as rapid immunochromatographic dipstick tests, aiming its use in epidemiological studies in remote areas where laboratories are not readily accessible for conventional assays. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Background: Brazil has at least 800,000 HTLV-1 infected individuals. HTLV-1 can be transmitted via sexual intercourse, contact with blood and from mother to child, mainly by breastfeeding. Treatments for the high morbidity/mortality associated diseases (ATL and HAM/TSP) are limited, therefore, infection prevention is of utmost importance. However, antenatal screening is not routinely performed in Brazil. A lack of data regarding the number of individuals infected via breastfeeding impairs the development of government policies. The objective is to estimate the number of HTLV-1 infections occurring annually due to mother to child transmission (MTCT) in Brazil, nationally and regionally. Methodology: To estimate HTLV-1 MTCT in Brazil the following variables are modelled: number of births, prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in pregnant women, breastfeeding duration rate and transmission risk according to breastfeeding period. The number of cases of HAM/TSP and ATL attributable to MTCT are also estimated. Principal findings: In 2008, there were 2,934,828 live births in Brazil. HTLV prevalence in pregnant women in Brazil ranges between 0.1–1.05% by region. An estimated 16,548 HTLV-1 infected women are pregnant each year. According to the breastfeeding pattern and HTLV-1 prevalence of each region there are an estimated 3,024 new cases of HTLV-1 infection due to MTCT annually of which 2,610 are preventable through infant feeding advice. These 3,024 transmissions will result in 120–604 cases of ATL and 8–272 of HAM/TSP. North-East region comprises the high number of MTCT cases, followed by South-East. Conclusions/significance: A high number of new HTLV-1 infections due to MTCT occur every year in Brazil. Antenatal screening and avoiding breastfeeding are essential to prevent subsequent development of HTLV-1-associated diseases. © 2018 Rosadas et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

AB  - Chagas disease is still a major public health issue in many Latin American countries. One of the current major challenges is to find an association between Trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs) and clinical manifestations of the disease. In this study, we used a multilocus conventional PCR and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) approaches to perform the molecular typing and parasite load quantification directly from blood specimens of 65 chronic Chagas disease patients. All patients were recruited at the same health center, but their place of birth were widely distributed in different geographic regions of Brazil. Of the 65 patients, 35 (53.8%) presented positive amplification by real time qPCR, being 20 (30.7%) with the clinical indeterminate form and 15 (23.1%) with the cardiac form of the disease. The parasite load median for all positive patients was 2.54 [1.43–11.14] parasite equivalents/mL (par. Eq./mL), with the load ranging from 0.12 to 153.66 par. Eq./mL. Noteworthy, the parasite load was significantly higher in patients over 70 years old (median 20.05 [18.29–86.86] par. Eq./mL). Using guanidine-EDTA blood samples spiked with reference T. cruzi strains, belonging to the six DTUs, it was possible to genotype the parasite up to 0.5 par. Eq./mL, with high specificity. Of the patients with positive qPCR, it was possible to identify the T. cruzi DTU in 28 patients (80%). For the remaining patients (20%), at least a partial result was obtained. Analysis of specimens showed prevalences of TcVI, TcII and mixed infection TcVI+TcII equal to 40%, 17.1% and 14.3%, respectively. In addition, two patients were infected by TcV, and one patient was coinfected by TcIII+TcVI, These last three patients were in stage A of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC), and they were born at the Bahia State (northeast region of Brazil). When T. cruzi genotypes were compared with the parasite load, more elevated parasite loads were observed in patients infected by TcII in general (parasite load median of 7.56 par. Eq./mL) in comparison to patients infected by TcVI (median of 2.35 par. Eq./mL). However, while the frequency of CCC was 50% in patients infected by TcVI and TcV, only 16.7% of patients infected by TcII evolved to CCC. Taking together, our results contribute to update the epidemiological knowledge of T. cruzi DTUs in Brazil, and highlight the age of patient and infection by TcII as important features that lead to the observation of higher parasitemia levels. © 2018 Rodrigues-dos-Santos et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

AB  - Chagas disease is the leading cause of cardiac-related mortality in Latin American countries where it is endemic. Trypanosoma cruzi, the disease-causing pathogen, is unable to synthesize purines de novo, necessitating salvage of preformed host purines. Therefore, purine and purine-nucleoside analogues might constitute an attractive source for identifying antitrypanosomal hits. In this study, structural elements of two purine-nucleoside analogues (i.e., cordycepin and a recently discovered 7-substituted 7-deazaadenosine) led to the identification of novel nucleoside analogues with potent in vitro activity. The structure-activity relationships of substituents at C-7 were investigated, ultimately leading to the selection of compound 5, with a C-7 para-chlorophenyl group, for in vivo evaluation. This derivative showed complete suppression of T. cruzi Y-strain blood parasitemia when orally administered twice daily for 5 days at 25 mg/kg and was able to protect infected mice from parasite-induced mortality. However, sterile cure by immunosuppression could not be demonstrated. Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Trypanosoma conorhini and Trypanosoma rangeli, like Trypanosoma cruzi, are kinetoplastid protist parasites of mammals displaying divergent hosts, geographic ranges and lifestyles. Largely nonpathogenic T. rangeli and T. conorhini represent clades that are phylogenetically closely related to the T. cruzi and T. cruzi-like taxa and provide insights into the evolution of pathogenicity in those parasites. T. rangeli, like T. cruzi is endemic in many Latin American countries, whereas T. conorhini is tropicopolitan. T. rangeli and T. conorhini are exclusively extracellular, while T. cruzi has an intracellular stage in the mammalian host. Results: Here we provide the first comprehensive sequence analysis of T. rangeli AM80 and T. conorhini 025E, and provide a comparison of their genomes to those of T. cruzi G and T. cruzi CL, respectively members of T. cruzi lineages TcI and TcVI. We report de novo assembled genome sequences of the low-virulent T. cruzi G, T. rangeli AM80, and T. conorhini 025E ranging from ~ 21-25 Mbp, with ~ 10,000 to 13,000 genes, and for the highly virulent and hybrid T. cruzi CL we present a ~ 65 Mbp in-house assembled haplotyped genome with ~ 12,500 genes per haplotype. Single copy orthologs of the two T. cruzi strains exhibited ~ 97% amino acid identity, and ~ 78% identity to proteins of T. rangeli or T. conorhini. Proteins of the latter two organisms exhibited ~ 84% identity. T. cruzi CL exhibited the highest heterozygosity. T. rangeli and T. conorhini displayed greater metabolic capabilities for utilization of complex carbohydrates, and contained fewer retrotransposons and multigene family copies, i.e. trans-sialidases, mucins, DGF-1, and MASP, compared to T. cruzi. Conclusions: Our analyses of the T. rangeli and T. conorhini genomes closely reflected their phylogenetic proximity to the T. cruzi clade, and were largely consistent with their divergent life cycles. Our results provide a greater context for understanding the life cycles, host range expansion, immunity evasion, and pathogenesis of these trypanosomatids. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the association between African and Native American genomic ancestry and long-term cognitive trajectories in admixed Brazilians. Design: Population-based longitudinal study. Setting: Bambui-Epigen (Brazil) cohort study. Participants: Adults aged 60 and older (N=1,215). Measurements: Participants were followed from January 1997 to December 2011. Cognitive function was assessed annually using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), totaling 12,208 measurements. We used linear mixed-effects pattern models to assess MMSE score trajectories. Ancestry was assessed using a genome-wide approach. Results: After adjustments for covariates, the highest quintile of African ancestry was associated with poorer baseline cognitive performance (β=–0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI)=–1.36 to –0.11) but not with cognitive trajectory. Educational level modified the baseline association between highest African ancestry and cognitive performance in that the association was observed only in those with very low (<4 years) education (β=–1.13, 95% CI=–2.02 to –0.23). No association was found between Native American ancestry and baseline cognitive function or its trajectory. Conclusion: Genomic African and Native American ancestry levels had no prognostic value for age-related cognitive decline in this admixed population. © 2018, Copyright the Author Journal compilation © 2018, The American Geriatrics Society

AB  - Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient in the diet of mammals and has an important role in the immune function. Selenium is a key element in selenoproteins involved in the in the maintenance of the antioxidant defense. Diet with selenium is beneficial for the treatment of diseases correlated with high levels of oxidative stress, also observed in the Chagas disease. Chagas disease is a neglected disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and several research groups are focused on the illness treatment. Immunomodulation of the infection using microelements is an important tool to avoid deleterious effects of the Chagas disease. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the effects of selenium supplementation on pregnant Wistar rats infected with T. cruzi. Selenium treatment stimulated the weight and length of fetuses and placentas allied to the decrease of blood parasitemia. However, selenium demonstrated a low influence on T cells, diminishing the B cell population (CD45RA+). Moreover, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was downregulated under selenium administration. Low pro-inflammatory cytokines levels probably are related to the increase in the number of amastigote nests in infected and treated animals. Thus, selenium supplementation during pregnancy could impair the local placental immune response. Further studies are necessary to assess the interaction between selenium and the acute Chagas’ disease during pregnancy, which will base future supplementation strategies. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides produced by humans and animals in response to various pathogenic microbes. Crotalicidin (Ctn), a cathelicidin-related vipericidin from the South American Crotalus durissus terrificus rattlesnake's venom gland, and its fragments have demonstrated antimicrobial and antifungal activity, similarly to human cathelicidin LL-37. In order to provide templates for the development of modern trypanocidal agents, the present study evaluated the antichagasic effect of these four peptides (Ctn, Ctn[1-14], Ctn[15-34] and LL-37). Herein, Ctn and short derived peptides were tested against the epimastigote, trypomastigote and amastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi Y strain (benznidazole-resistant strain) and cytotoxicity in mammalian cells was evaluated against LLC-MK2 lineage cells. Ctn inhibited all T. cruzi developmental forms, including amastigotes, which is implicated in the burden of infection in the chronic phase of Chagas disease. Moreover, Ctn showed a high selective index against trypomastigote forms (>200). Ctn induced cell death in T. cruzi through necrosis, as determined by flow cytometry analyses with specific molecular probes and morphological alterations, such as loss of membrane integrity and cell shrinkage, as observed through scanning electron microscopy. Overall, Ctn seems to be a promising template for the development of antichagasic agents. Copyright © Cambridge University Press 2017Â.

AB  - Trypanosoma rangeli and Trypanosoma cruzi are generalist trypanosomes sharing a wide range of mammalian hosts; they are transmitted by triatomine bugs, and are the only trypanosomes infecting humans in the Neotropics. Their origins, phylogenetic relationships, and emergence as human parasites have long been subjects of interest. In the present study, taxon-rich analyses (20 trypanosome species from bats and terrestrial mammals) using ssrRNA, glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH), heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) and Spliced Leader RNA sequences, and multilocus phylogenetic analyses using 11 single copy genes from 15 selected trypanosomes, provide increased resolution of relationships between species and clades, strongly supporting two main sister lineages: lineage Schizotrypanum, comprising T. cruzi and bat-restricted trypanosomes, and Tra[Tve-Tco] formed by T. rangeli, Trypanosoma vespertilionis and Trypanosoma conorhini clades. Tve comprises European T. vespertilionis and African T. vespertilionis-like of bats and bat cimicids characterised in the present study and Trypanosoma sp. Hoch reported in monkeys and herein detected in bats. Tco included the triatomine-transmitted tropicopolitan T. conorhini from rats and the African NanDoum1 trypanosome of civet (carnivore). Consistent with their very close relationships, Tra[Tve-Tco] species shared highly similar Spliced Leader RNA structures that were highly divergent from those of Schizotrypanum. In a plausible evolutionary scenario, a bat trypanosome transmitted by cimicids gave origin to the deeply rooted Tra[Tve-Tco] and Schizotrypanum lineages, and bat trypanosomes of diverse genetic backgrounds jumped to new hosts. A long and independent evolutionary history of T. rangeli more related to Old World trypanosomes from bats, rats, monkeys and civets than to Schizotrypanum spp., and the adaptation of these distantly related trypanosomes to different niches of shared mammals and vectors, is consistent with the marked differences in transmission routes, life-cycles and host-parasite interactions, resulting in T. cruzi (but not T. rangeli) being pathogenic to humans. © 2018 Australian Society for Parasitology

AB  - Background: Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) infects millions of Latin Americans each year and can induce chagasic megacolon. Little is known about how serotonin (5-HT) modulates this condition. Aim We investigated whether 5-HT synthesis alters T. cruzi infection in the colon. Materials and Methods: Forty-eight paraffin-embedded samples from normal colon and chagasic megacolon were histopathologically analyzed (173/2009). Tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph1) knockout (KO) mice and c-KitW-sh mice underwent T. cruzi infection together with their wild-type counterparts. Also, mice underwent different drug treatments (16.1.1064.60.3). Results: In both humans and experimental mouse models, the serotonergic system was activated by T. cruzi infection (p &lt; 0.05). While treating Tph1KO mice with 5-HT did not significantly increase parasitemia in the colon (p &gt; 0.05), rescuing its synthesis promoted trypanosomiasis (p &lt; 0.01). T. cruzi-related 5-HT release (p &lt; 0.05) seemed not only to increase inflammatory signaling, but also to enlarge the pericryptal macrophage and mast cell populations (p &lt; 0.01). Knocking out mast cells reduced trypanosomiasis (p &lt; 0.01), although it did not further alter the neuroendocrine cell number and Tph1 expression (p &gt; 0.05). Further experimentation revealed that pharmacologically inhibiting mast cell activity reduced colonic infection (p &lt; 0.01). A similar finding was achieved when 5-HT synthesis was blocked in c-KitW-sh mice (p &gt; 0.05). However, inhibiting mast cell activity in Tph1KO mice increased colonic trypanosomiasis (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: We show that mast cells may modulate the T. cruzi-related increase of 5-HT synthesis in the intestinal colon. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is transmitted to mammals - including humans - by insect vectors of the subfamily Triatominae. We present the results of a compilation of triatomine occurrence and complementary ecological data that represents the most complete, integrated and updated database (DataTri) available on triatomine species at a continental scale. This database was assembled by collecting the records of triatomine species published from 1904 to 2017, spanning all American countries with triatomine presence. A total of 21815 georeferenced records were obtained from published literature, personal fieldwork and data provided by colleagues. The data compiled includes 24 American countries, 14 genera and 135 species. From a taxonomic perspective, 67.33% of the records correspond to the genus Triatoma, 20.81% to Panstrongylus, 9.01% to Rhodnius and the remaining 2.85% are distributed among the other 11 triatomine genera.

AB  - American trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease (CD) is a vector borne pathology caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), which remains a serious global health problem. The current available treatment for CD is limited to two nitroderivatives with limited efficacy and several side effects. The rational design of ergosterol synthetic route inhibitors (e.g. CYP51 inhibitors) represents a promising strategy for fungi and trypanosomatids, exhibiting excellent anti-T.cruzi activity in pre-clinical assays. In the present work, we evaluate through different approaches (molecular docking, structure activity relationships, CYP51 inhibitory assay, and phenotypic screenings in vitro and in vivo) the potency and selectivity of a novel CYP51 inhibitor (compound 1) and its analogues against T.cruzi infection. Regarding anti-parasitic effect, compound 1 was active in vitro with EC50 3.86 and 4.00 μM upon intracellular (Tulahuen strain) and bloodstream forms (Y strain), respectively. In vivo assays showed that compound 1 reduced in 43% the parasitemia peak but, unfortunately failed to promote animal survival. In order to promote an enhancement at the potency and pharmacological properties, 17 new analogues were purchased and screened in vitro. Our findings demonstrated that five compounds were active against intracellular forms, highlighting compounds 1e and 1f, with EC50 2.20 and 2.70 μM, respectively, and selectivity indices (SI) = 50 and 36, respectively. Against bloodstream trypomastigotes, compound 1f reached an EC50 value of 20.62 μM, in a similar range to Benznidazole, but with low SI (3). Although improved the solubility of compound 1, the analogue 1f did not enhance the potency in vitro neither promote better in vivo efficacy against mouse model of acute T.cruzi infection arguing for the synthesis of novel pyrazolo[3,4-e][1,4]thiazepin derivatives aiming to contribute for alternative therapies for CD. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Background: Chagas disease also known as American trypanosomiasis is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Over the last 30 years, Chagas disease has expanded from a neglected parasitic infection of the rural population to an urbanized chronic disease, becoming a potentially emergent global health problem. T. cruzi strains were assigned to seven genetic groups (TcI-TcVI and TcBat), named discrete typing units (DTUs), which represent a set of isolates that differ in virulence, pathogenicity and immunological features. Indeed, diverse clinical manifestations (from asymptomatic to highly severe disease) have been attempted to be related to T.cruzi genetic variability. Due to that, several DTU typing methods have been introduced. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks such as high complexity and analysis time and all of them are based on genetic signatures. Recently, a novel method discriminated bacterial strains using a peptide identification-free, genome sequence-independent shotgun proteomics workflow. Here, we aimed to develop a Trypanosoma cruzi Strain Typing Assay using MS/MS peptide spectral libraries, named Tc-STAMS2. Methods/Principal findings: The Tc-STAMS2 method uses shotgun proteomics combined with spectral library search to assign and discriminate T. cruzi strains independently on the genome knowledge. The method is based on the construction of a library of MS/MS peptide spectra built using genotyped T. cruzi reference strains. For identification, the MS/MS peptide spectra of unknown T. cruzi cells are identified using the spectral matching algorithm SpectraST. The Tc-STAMS2 method allowed correct identification of all DTUs with high confidence. The method was robust towards different sample preparations, length of chromatographic gradients and fragmentation techniques. Moreover, a pilot inter-laboratory study showed the applicability to different MS platforms. Conclusions and significance: This is the first study that develops a MS-based platform for T. cruzi strain typing. Indeed, the Tc-STAMS2 method allows T. cruzi strain typing using MS/MS spectra as discriminatory features and allows the differentiation of TcI-TcVI DTUs. Similar to genomic-based strategies, the Tc-STAMS2 method allows identification of strains within DTUs. Its robustness towards different experimental and biological variables makes it a valuable complementary strategy to the current T. cruzi genotyping assays. Moreover, this method can be used to identify DTU-specific features correlated with the strain phenotype. © 2018 de Oliveira et al.

AB  - The aim of this study were to detect antibodies anti-Leishmania spp. and anti-Trypanosoma cruzi in two different populations of domestic cats (Felis catus domesticus) from North Paraná referred for surgical castration and to determine which characteristics of the animals studied may be associated with seropositivity. Serum samples from 679 cats were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) in series. Associations between age, sex, race, year of care and animal group were verified using the simple logistic regression. Percentage of 8.5% (58/679) of cats were positive for Leishmania spp. and 7.6% (51/673) for T. cruzi by the tests ELISA and IFAT. Animals collected by non-governmental animal protection organizations presented more seropositivity for Leishmania spp. (p < 0.0001). Results shown that Leishmania spp. and T. cruzi are present in domestic cats in the northern part of the state of Paraná, as well as, owners of non-governmental animal protection organizations may be more exposed to leishmaniasis when compared to other animal owners evaluated in the present study.

AB  - Background: Vimentin is a main structural protein of the cell, a component of intermediate cell filaments and immersed in cytoplasm. Vimentin is mimicked by some bacterial proteins and anti-vimentin antibodies occur in autoimmune cardiac disease, as rheumatic fever. In this work we studied vimentin distribution on LLC-MK2 cells infected with T. cruzi and anti-vimentin antibodies in sera from several clinical pictures of Chagas’ disease or American Trypanosomiasis, in order to elucidate any vimentin involvement in the humoral response of this pathology. Objective: We standardized an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFI) to determine sub cellular expression in either parasites and host cells, and ELISA to evaluate anti-vimentin antibodies in sera fron chagasic patients. Methods: We analyzed the distribution of vimentin in culture cells using indirect fluorescent assays, using as external controls anti-T. cruzi sera, derived from chronic infected patients for identification of the parasites in the same model. After infection and growth of T.cruzi amastigotes, those cells express larger amounts of vimentin, with heavy staining of cytoplasm outside the parasitophorous vacuole and some particle shadowing patterns, suggesting that vimentin are associated with cell cytoplasm. Anti-vimentin antibodies were present in most American trypanosomiasis samples, but notably, they are much more present in acute (76, 9%) or clinical defined syndromes, especially cardiac disease (87, 9%). Paradoxically, they were relatively infrequent in asymptomatic (25%) infected patients, which had a clearly positive serological reaction to parasite antigens, but had low frequency of anti-vimentin antibodies, similar to controls (2,5%). Conclusion: Our current data revealed that anti-vimentin antibodies induced during T. cruzi infection could be a marker of active disease in the host and its levels could also justify drug therapy in American Trypanosomiasis chronic infection, as a large group of asymptomatic patients would be submitted to treatment with frequent adverse reactions of the available drugs. Anti-vimentin antibodies could be a marker of cardiac muscle cell damage, appearing in American Trypanosomiasis patients during active muscle cell damage. © 2018, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

AB  - Chagas cardiomyopathy is the most severe clinical manifestation of chronic Chagas disease. The disease affects most of the Latin American countries, being considered one of the leading causes of morbidity and death in the continent. The pathogenesis of Chagas cardiomyopathy is very complex, with mechanisms involving parasite-dependent cytopathy, immune-mediated myocardial damage and neurogenic disturbances. These pathological changes eventually result in cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure and stroke during chronic infection phase. Herein, we show that miR-208a, a microRNA that is a key factor in promoting cardiovascular dysfunction during cardiac hypertrophy processes of heart failure, has its circulating levels increased during chronic indeterminate phase when compared to cardiac (CARD) clinical forms in patients with Chagas disease. In contrast, we have not found altered serum levels of miR-34a, a microRNA known to promote pro-apoptotic role in myocardial infarction during degenerative process of cardiac injuries thus indicating intrinsic differences in the nature of the mechanisms underlying the heart failure triggered by Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Our findings support that the chronic indeterminate phase is a progressive phase involved in the genesis of chagasic cardiopathy and point out the use of plasma levels of miR-208a as candidate biomarker in risk-prediction score for the clinical prognosis of Chagas disease. © 2018 Linhares-Lacerda, Granato, Gomes-Neto, Conde, Freire-de-Lima, de Freitas, Freire-de-Lima, Coutinho Barroso, Jorge de Alcântara Guerra, Pedrosa, Savino and Morrot.

AB  - Historically, emerging infectious agents have been an important driving force toward the enhancement of blood safety, illustrated by the sharp reduction in the transmission of infectious agents by blood transfusion after human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics. In general, Latin American (LATAM) countries have introduced screening for microorganisms with proven blood transmission with some delay in comparison to developed countries, but, nowadays, all LATAM countries comply with a minimum standard of screening which includes Hepatitis B, C, HIV, Treponema pallidum, and Trypanosoma cruzi. Noticeably, all those agents, in addition to HTLV, cause chronic infections. By contrast, in the last decade, the region has witnessed explosive outbreaks of arboviral diseases, representing a new challenge to the blood system, threatening not only blood safety but also availability. So far, the clinical impact of transfusion-transmitted Dengue, Chikungunya, or Zika has not been evident, precluding immediate reaction from the authorities. A number of other arboviruses are endemic in the region and may, unpredictably, originate new epidemics. Several measures must be taken in preparedness for the potential emergence of another arbodisease. © 2018 Levi.

AB  - We previously found that, in a mouse model of Chagas cardiomyopathy, 18% of the 9390 quantified unigenes were significantly regulated by Trypanosoma cruzi infection. However, treatment with bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (MNCs) resulted in 84% transcriptomic recovery. We have applied new algorithms to reanalyze these datasets with respect to specific pathways [Chagas disease (CHAGAS), cardiac muscle contraction (CMC) and chemokine signaling (CCS)]. In addition to the levels of expression of individual genes we also calculated gene expression variability and coordination of expression of each gene with all others. These additional measures revealed changes in the control of transcript abundances and gene networking in CHAGAS and restoration following MNC treatment, not accessible using the conventional approach limited to the average expression levels. Moreover, our weighted pathway regulation analysis incorporated the contributions of all affected genes, eliminating the arbitrary cut-off criteria of fold-change and/or p-value for significantly regulated genes. The new analyses revealed that T. cruzi infection had large transcriptomic consequences for the CMC pathway and triggered a huge cytokine signaling. Remarkably, MNC therapy not only restored normal expression levels of numerous genes, but it also recovered most of the CHAGAS, CMC and CCS fabrics that were altered by the infection. © 2017 Institut Pasteur

AB  - Chagas disease is included in the neglected tropical diseases list and is endemic to 21 Latin American countries. The two drugs currently available for treating Chagas disease are nifurtimox and benznidazole and both result in many significant side effects. The study describes the synthesis and biological evaluation of 3,5-disubstituted isoxazoles. Isoxazoles were obtained by reaction of flavones and hydroxylamine and either alkylated at the free hydroxyl group and/or nitrated at the isoxazole ring. These compounds were evaluated for their in vitro anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity against trypomastigote and amastigote forms of the parasite in T. cruzi-infected cell lineages. Benznidazole was used as a reference compound for the in vitro assay and mammalian L929 cells were employed to evaluate cytotoxicity. A majority of the compounds tested were very active and the most active isoxazole against amastigote and trypomastigotes of T. cruzi was slightly more potent than the current medicine benznidazole. ©2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is an important neglected tropical illness caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which is primarily transmitted to humans by hematophagous insects of the subfamily Triatominae. Although knowledge on triatomine movement capabilities at the micro-geographical scale is of fundamental importance concerning the development of effective vector control strategies, it remains a poorly understood subject. Furthermore, survival rates and size estimates of natural populations are important topics to consider when evaluating transmission intensity.
RESULTS: The movement of adult Triatoma sordida within the peridomestic area of a rural Brazilian household was evaluated via mark-release-recapture assays. A total of 210 insects had their pronota marked with fluorescent dyes and were released at different distances from the chicken coop (two, five, ten and 20 m), and from the horse corral (27, 32, 35, 46 and 56 m). Recaptures occurred in three consecutive 15-day intervals. Specimens were successfully recaptured at all distances up to 32 m. Bayesian models were used to estimate recapture probability, survival rates (males vs females) and population size. Although recapture probability was inversely proportional to distance for both sexes, females were more affected by increased distance. On the other hand, no significant difference was detected in the survival rates between males and females in a 15-day period. Fisher-Ford and Bayesian models gave more accurate population size estimates than Lincoln method.
CONCLUSIONS: Triatoma sordida adults were able to cover a distance of 32 m in 45 days. Recapture data modelling reveals that male dispersal was more effective suggesting that T. sordida males are more likely to contribute as potential colonizers of the peridomestic environment. Increasing the distance between the peridomestic structures and the sylvatic environment as much as possible appears to be a simple and feasible recommendation to reduce the contact rate between humans and infected bugs and ultimately Chagas disease transmission.

AB  - Introduction: Although international health research involves some benefits for the host countries, such as access to innovative treatments, the research itself may not be aligned with their communities' actual health needs. Objective: To map the global landscape of clinical trials run in Latin American and Caribbean countries and discuss the addressing of local health needs in the agenda of international clinical trials. Methods: The present study is a cross-sectional overview and used data referent to studies registered between 01/01/2014 and 12/31/2014 in the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). Results: Non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and asthma-studies which were financed mainly by industries-were the conditions investigated most in the region of Latin America and the Caribbean. The neglected diseases, on the other hand, such as Chagas disease, and dengue, made up 1% of the total number of studies. Hospitals and nonprofit nongovernmental organizations prioritize resources for investigating new drugs for neglected diseases, such as Chagas disease and dengue. Conclusion: The international multicenter clinical trials for investigating new drugs are aligned with the health needs of the region of Latin America and the Caribbean, when one considers the burden resulting from the non-communicable diseases in this region. However, the transmissible diseases, such as tuberculosis and AIDS, and the neglected diseases, such as Chagas disease and dengue, which have an important impact on public health in this region, continue to arouse little interest among the institutions which finance the clinical trials. © 2018 Silva, Amato, Guilherm, Carvalho and Novaes.

AB  - Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis is an important health problem in Latin America. Due to the mobility of Latin American population around the world, countries without vector presence started to report disease cases. We developed a deterministic compartmental model in order to gain insights into the disease dynamics in a scenario without vector presence, considering congenital transmission and transmission by blood transfusion. The model was used to evaluate the epidemiological effect of control measures. It was applied to demographic data from Spain and sensitivity analysis was performed on model parameters associated with control strategies. Copyright © 2018 Edneide Ramalho et al.

AB  - Introdução: Chagas disease (CD), also known as American Trypanosomiasis, is an infectious parasitic disease caused by the etiologic agent Trypanosoma cruzi. It is considered endemic in the low-income population and is classified by the WHO as a neglected tropical disease. In the state of Acre, there is almost no scientific data regarding the epidemiology of CD, even though the first autochthonous case was registered in the 1980s. Objetivo: To analyze the epidemiological panorama of the transmission of Chagas disease in the State of Acre, Brazil, from 2009 to 2016. Método: A survey of the occurrence of Chagas disease in the State of Acre was performed using public domain secondary data from the Brazil's Notifiable Diseases Information System of SUS (publicly funded health care system), and from the SUS Database of the Health Surveillance Foundation of the State of Acre. Data were collected from the following variables: gender, age group, form of contagion, distribution by region and municipality, perimeter and seasonality. Resultados: Forty-two cases of CD were confirmed, with an increase of more than 300% from 2015 to 2016 and a frequency coefficient of 3.06 cases per 100,000 people, and in the Tarauacá/Envira region, the probability of a person contracting CD was 600% higher than the state mean. Conclusão: We found that in the state of Acre, in the period from 2009 to 2016, most cases of CD occurred in 2016, in the Tarauacá/Envira region, mainly in the municipality of Feijó, in the rural zone, from July to October, in the age group of 0 to 30 years, being the oral form the main route of transmission and presenting no statistical difference between men and women. © The authors (2018).
Introdução: A doença de Chagas (DC), também conhecida como Tripanossomíase Americana, é uma doença infecciosa e parasitária, causada pelo agente etiológico Trypanosoma cruzi, sendo considerada endêmica em população de baixa renda e classificada pela Organização Mundial da Saúde como uma doença tropical negligenciada. No estado do Acre, quase não há dados científicos sobre a epidemiologia da DC, embora o primeiro caso autóctone tenha sido registrado na década de 1980. Objetivo: Analisar o panorama epidemiológico da transmissão da DC no Estado do Acre, no período de 2009 a 2016. Método: O levantamento da ocorrência da DC no Estado do Acre foi realizado utilizando dados secundários de domínio público do Sistema de Informação de Agravos de Notificação do SUS e do Banco de Dados do SUS da Fundação de Vigilância Sanitária do Estado do Acre. Foram coletados dados das seguintes variáveis: sexo, faixa etária, forma de contágio, distribuição por região e município, perímetro e sazonalidade. Resultado: Quarenta e dois casos de DC foram confirmados, com um aumento de mais de 300% de 2015 a 2016 e um coeficiente de frequência de 3,06 casos por 100.000 pessoas, e na região de Tarauacá / Envira, a probabilidade de uma pessoa contrair CD foi de 600% maior que a média do estado. Conclusão: Constatamos que no estado do Acre, no período de 2009 a 2016, a maioria dos casos de DC ocorreu em 2016, na região de Tarauacá/Envira, principalmente no município de Feijó, na zona rural, de julho a outubro, em faixa etária de 0 a 30 anos, sendo a via oral a principal via de transmissão e sem diferença estatística entre homens e mulheres. © The authors (2018).

AB  - Background: Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. This illness is found mainly in 21 Latin American countries and an estimated 8 million people are infected worldwide. The unsatisfactory chemotherapy provokes severe toxicity and resistant strains. Medicinal plants constitute a promising source of new drugs and remedies against all kinds of disorders, mainly infectious diseases arousing interest worldwide. Objective: The aim of this study is the isolation, structural identification and evaluation of the trypanocidal activity of samples present in the Excoecaria lucida Sw. leaves. Methods: Total extract (TE) of E. lucida Sw. leaves was obtained by ethanol extract therefore fractionated sequentially with hexane, ethyl acetate and n-butanol, to obtain three phases: Hex, EA and But, respectively. Ellagic acid (EL1) was purified from both EA and But phases, while EL2; a 1:1 stigmasterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside plus sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside mixture was obtained from the Hex phase. Activity assays were performed using bloodstream and intracellular forms of T. cruzi and cytotoxicity assays using L929 fibroblasts. Results: The EL1 and EL2 samples were more active against bloodstream trypomastigote forms with EC50 of 53.0±3.6 and 58.2±29.0 μg/mL, respectively; at 100 μg/mL. These samples also showed 70% of inhibition of L929 cells infection. Toxicity assays demonstrated that after 96 h of treatment only the fractions Hex and EA presented detectable cytotoxicity. Conclusion: Ellagic acid, stigmasterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and sitosterol-3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside are reported for the first time in E. lucida Sw. leaves as well as their biological activity studies supporting further investigations for Chagas disease treatment. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas disease represents an important health problem with socioeconomic impacts in many Latin-American countries. It is estimated that 20% to 30% of the people infected by Trypanosoma cruzi will develop chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), which is generally accompanied by heart failure (HF). Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may be indicated for patients with HF and electromechanical dysfunctions. Objective: The primary endpoint of this study was to analyze the response to CRT in patients with CCC, while the secondary endpoint was to estimate the survival rates of CRT responder patients. Methods: This is an observational, cross-sectional and retrospective study. The records of 50 patients with CRT pacing devices implanted between June 2009 and March 2017 were analyzed. For statistical analyses, Pearson’s correlation was used along with Student’s t-test, and survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results: Out of 50 patients, 56% were male, with a mean age of 63.4±13.3 years and an average CRT duration of 61.2±21.7 months. The mean QRS duration was 150.12±12.4 ms before and 116.04±2.2 ms after the therapy (P<0.001). The mean left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF) were 29±7% and 39.1±12.2% before and after CRT, respectively (P<0.001). A total of 35 (70%) patients had a reduction of at least one New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class after six months of therapy (P=0.014). The survival rate after 72 months was 45%. Conclusion: This study showed clinical improvement and a non-significant survival rate in patients with CCC after the use of CRT. © 2018, Sociedade Brasileira de Cirurgia Cardiovascular.

AB  - Objective: We evaluated the effect of Trypanosoma cruzi infection on fertility, gestation outcome, and maternal-fetal transmission in guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus). Methods: Animals were infected with T. cruzi H4 strain (TcI lineage) before gestation (IBG) or during gestation (IDG). Tissue and sera samples of dams and fetuses were obtained near parturition. Results: All IBG and IDG dams were seropositive by two tests, and exhibited blood parasite load of 1.62±2.2 and 50.1±62 parasites/μl, respectively, by quantitative PCR. Histological evaluation showed muscle fiber degeneration and cellular necrosis in all infected dams. Parasite nests were not detected in infected dams by histology. However, qPCR analysis detected parasites-eq/g heart tissue of 153±104.7 and 169.3±129.4 in IBG and IDG dams, respectively. All fetuses of infected dams were positive for anti-parasite IgG antibodies and tissue parasites by qPCR, but presented a low level of tissue inflammatory infiltrate. Fetuses of IDG (vs. IBG) dams exhibited higher degree of muscle fiber degeneration and cellular necrosis in the heart and skeletal tissues. The placental tissue exhibited no inflammatory lesions and amastigote nests, yet parasites-eq/g of 381.2±34.3 and 79.2±84.9 were detected in IDG and IBG placentas, respectively. Fetal development was compromised, and evidenced by a decline in weight, crow-rump length, and abdominal width in both groups. Conclusions: T. cruzi TcI has a high capacity of congenital transmission even when it was inoculated at a very low dose before or during gestation. Tissue lesions, parasite load, and fetal under development provide evidence for high virulence of the parasite during pregnancy. Despite finding of high parasite burden by qPCR, placentas were protected from cellular damage. Our studies offer an experimental model to study the efficacy of vaccines and drugs against congenital transmission of T. cruzi. These results also call for T. cruzi screening in pregnant women and adequate follow up of the newborns in endemic areas. © 2018 Torres-Vargas et al.

AB  - BACKGROUND Didelphis spp. are a South American marsupial species that are among the most ancient hosts for the Trypanosoma spp. OBJECTIVES We characterise a new species (Trypanosoma janseni n. sp.) isolated from the spleen and liver tissues of Didelphis aurita in the Atlantic Rainforest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. METHODS The parasites were isolated and a growth curve was performed in NNN and Schneider’s media containing 10% foetal bovine serum. Parasite morphology was evaluated via light microscopy on Giemsa-stained culture smears, as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Molecular taxonomy was based on a partial region (737-bp) of the small subunit (18S) ribosomal RNA gene and 708 bp of the nuclear marker, glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) genes. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods were used to perform a species coalescent analysis and to generate individual and concatenated gene trees. Divergence times among species that belong to the T. cruzi clade were also inferred. FINDINGS In vitro growth curves demonstrated a very short log phase, achieving a maximum growth rate at day 3 followed by a sharp decline. Only epimastigote forms were observed under light and scanning microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed structures typical to Trypanosoma spp., except one structure that presented as single-membraned, usually grouped in stacks of three or four. Phylogeography analyses confirmed the distinct species status of T. janseni n. sp. within the T. cruzi clade. Trypanosoma janseni n. sp. clusters with T. wauwau in a well-supported clade, which is exclusive and monophyletic. The separation of the South American T. wauwau + T. janseni coincides with the separation of the Southern Super Continent. CONCLUSIONS This clade is a sister group of the trypanosomes found in Australian marsupials and its discovery sheds light on the initial diversification process based on what we currently know about the T. cruzi clade. © 2018, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

AB  - Chagas disease afflicts 7 to 8 million people worldwide and congenital Chagas' disease usually leads to changes in the maternal environment, culminating in fetal adaptations. Several articles have described the importance of micronutrients on pregnancy, which is sensitive to infections. In Trypanosoma cruzi endemic regions, the Chagas disease is aggravated by the lack of micronutrients in an average diet, to which pregnant women are more susceptible. The aim of this study was to evaluate distinct T cells phenotypes and intracellular cytokines by flow cytometry in pregnant Wistar rats under zinc therapy during experimental Chagas' disease. Twenty female Wistar rats were infected with 1 × 105 blood trypomastigotes (Y strain) and 30 days after infection the animals were mated and grouped: pregnant infected (PI–n = 5), pregnant infected/zinc supplied (PIZ–n = 5), pregnant control (PC–n = 5), control/zinc supplied (PCZ–n = 5). Zinc supplementation: 20 mg of zinc/Kg/day (gavage) for 18 days followed by euthanasia. The immune parameters showed: decreased percentages of CD62LlowCD44high surface marker for infected and treated group (PIZ) when compared to PI (p &lt; 0.05). Concerning to T regulatory cells (Treg cells), a significantly lower percentage of splenic Treg cells was found in the infected and treated group (PIZ) as compared to the PI group (p &lt; 0.05). The expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD28+ displayed a significant reduced percentage in TCD8+ for infected and zinc treated group (PIZ) as compared to (PI). The percentages of CD4+/CD11a+ T cells subsets were lower on PIZ as compared to PI. Concerning to CD45RA+ (B lymphocytes) analysis, infected pregnant and treated group (PIZ) showed a significant decrease in CD45RA percentage when compared to (PI) (p &lt; 0.05). The intracellular cytokine profiles for TCD4+ and TCD8+ producing IL-4 and IFN-γ revealed that zinc treated and untreated infected pregnant group (PI and PIZ) displayed increased cytokines concentrations as compared to zinc treated and untreated pregnant controls (PC and PCZ). Our data revealed the involvement of zinc as a signaling molecule in the modulation of the inflammatory process and immune response which occurs during pregnancy of T. cruzi infected rats. Zinc acted in a dual fashion, modulating the host's immune response in a way to protect the organism against the deleterious effects of the infection and an overwhelming pro-inflammatory response during pregnancy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Patients with Chagas’ disease may develop dysfunctions of oesophageal and colonic motility resulting from the degeneration or loss of the myenteric neurons of the enteric nervous system. Studies have shown that the use of aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), influences the pathogenesis of the disease. However, this remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequences of treatment with low doses of aspirin during the chronic phase of Chagas’ disease on oesophageal function. Twenty male Swiss mice, 60 days of age, were used. The animals were infected with Y strain of Trypanosoma cruzi, injected intraperitoneally. Aspirin was given at a dose of 50 mg/kg to some of the infected animals, from the 55th to 63rd day after inoculation on consecutive days, and from the 65th to 75th day on alternate days. We investigated food passage of time, wall structure and nitrergic neuronal population of the distal oesophagus. Our data revealed that the use of low doses of aspirin in chronic Chagas’ disease caused an increase in the number of nitrergic neurons and partially prevented hypertrophy of the oesophagus. In addition, the aspirin administration impeded Chagas' diseases associated changes in intestinal transit time. Thus treatment with aspirin in the chronic phase of Chagas’ disease changes the natural history of the disease and raises the possibility of using it as a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of this aspect of Chagas' disease pathology. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Chagas disease is one of the most significant health problems in the American continent. benznidazole (BDZ) and nifurtimox (NFX) are the only drugs approved for treatment and exhibit strong side effects and ineffectiveness in the chronic stage, besides different susceptibility among T. cruzi DTUs (Discrete Typing Units). Therefore, new drugs to treat this disease are necessary. Thiazole compounds have been described as potent trypanocidal agents. Here we report the structural planning, synthesis and anti-T. cruzi evaluation of a new series of 1,3-thiazoles (7–28), which were designed by placing this heterocycle instead of thiazolidin-4-one ring. The synthesis was conducted in an ultrasonic bath with 2-propanol as solvent at room temperature. By varying substituents attached to the phenyl and thiazole rings, substituents were observed to retain, enhance or greatly increase their anti-T. cruzi activity. In some cases, methyl at position 5 of the thiazole (compounds 9, 12 and 23) increased trypanocidal property. The exchange of phenyl for pyridinyl heterocycle resulted in increased activity, giving rise to the most potent compound against the trypomasigote form (14, IC50trypo = 0.37 μM). Importantly, these new thiazoles were toxic for trypomastigotes without affecting macrophages and cardiomyoblast viability. The compounds were also evaluated against cruzain, and five of the most active compounds against trypomastigotes (7, 9, 12, 16 and 23) inhibited more than 70% of enzymatic activity at 10 μM, among which compound 7 had an IC50 in the submicromolar range, suggesting a possible mechanism of action. In addition, examination of T. cruzi cell death showed that compound 14 induces apoptosis. We also examined the activity against intracellular parasites, revealing that compound 14 inhibited T. cruzi infection with potency similar to benznidazole. The antiparasitic effect of 14 and benznidazole in combination was also investigated against trypomastigotes and revealed that they have synergistic effects, showing a promising profile for drug combination. Finally, in mice acutely-infected with T. cruzi, 14 treatment significanty reduced the blood parasitaemia and had a protective effect on mortality. In conclusion, we report the identification of compounds (7), (12), (15), (23) and (26) with similar trypanocidal activity of benznidazole; compounds (9) and (21) as trypanocidal agents equipotent with BDZ, and compound 14 with potency 28 times better than the reference drug without affecting macrophages and cardiomyoblast viability. Mechanistically, the compounds inhibit cruzain, and 14 induces T. cruzi cell death by an apoptotic process, being considered a good starting point for the development of new anti-Chagas drug candidates. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Hundreds of trypanosome species have been described in all mammalian orders, on every continent, including with mixed infections. Trypanosomes circulate in the form of sylvatic enzootic infections transmitted by blood-sucking insects that are associated with the host mammals. Small wild mammals were caught in a fragment of Cerrado terrain on an island in the hydroelectric reservoir of Três Marias, in the central region of the state of Minas Gerais, using pitfall and Sherman traps with different means of attraction. DNA samples from these mammals were subjected to the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the full-length genes SSU rDNA and gGAPDH. A total of 232 animals of the orders Didelphimorphia, Rodentia, Chiroptera and Cingulata were caught (total of 17 species). There were also four species of marsupials: Monodelphis domestica, Didelphis albiventris, Gralicinanus agilis and Micoureus paraguaianus. Among these, there were eight positive individuals of Monodelphis domestica. However, nine cultures were established, because one of them was parasitized by two species of trypanosomes: Trypanosoma cruzi and a new trypanosome species. The new species have a large epimastigote forms, and with a well-developed undulating membrane in trypomastigote forms. The new species Trypanosoma gennarii was described in Monodelphis domestica. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Chagas, or American trypanosomiasis, remains an important public health problem in developing countries. In the last decade, trans-sialidase has become a pharmacological target for new anti-Chagas drugs. In this work, the aims were to design and find a new series of benzoic acid derivatives as trans-sialidase (TS) inhibitors and anti-trypanosomal agents. Three compounds (14, 18, and 19) sharing a para-aminobenzoic acid moiety showed more potent trypanocidal activity than the commercially available drugs nifurtimox and benznidazole in both strains: the lysis concentration of 50% of the population (LC50) was &lt;0.15 μM on the NINOA strain, and LC50 &lt; 0.22 μM on the INC-5 strain. Additionally, compound 18 showed a moderate inhibition (47%) on the trans-sialidase enzyme and a binding model similar to DANA (pattern A). © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Inflammation, particularly elevated IL-6 serum levels, has been associated with increased mortality risk, mostly in Caucasians. The influence of genetic ethno-racial background on this association is unknown. We examined associations between baseline serum levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other cytokines (IL1-2, TNF, IL-10, and IL1β) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9 and CXCL10) with 15-year mortality in 1,191 admixed Brazilians aged 60 years and over. Elevated IL6 level (but not other biomarkers) was associated with increased risk of deaths with fully adjusted hazard ratios of 1.51 (95% CI = 1.15, 1.97), 1.54 (95% CI = 1.20, 1.96) and 1.79 (95% CI = 1.40, 2.29) for the 2nd, 3rd and the highest quartiles, respectively. Genomic African and Native American proportions did not modify the association (p > 0.05). The discriminatory ability to predict death of a model based on IL-6 alone was similar as that of a comprehensive morbidity score (C statistics = 0.59 and 0.60, respectively). The abilities of IL-6 and the morbidity score models to predict death remained stable for very long term after the baseline measurement. Our results indicate that genome-based African and Native American ancestries have no impact on the prognostic value of IL-6 for mortality. © 2017

AB  - Chagas disease (Cd) or American human trypanosomiasis is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and affects ~7 million people, mostly in Latin America. The infective trypomastigote forms of the parasite can invade several human blood cell populations, including monocytes and dendritic cells (DC). Although these cells display a wide functional diversity, their interactions with T. cruzi via cyclooxygenase (COX) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) dependent pathways have not been analyzed. To exploiting this mechanism, DC-enriched peripheral human blood mononuclear cell populations (DC-PBMC) were used as our model. Our results showed that the treatment of these cell populations with celecoxib (CEL), a cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor or SQ 22,536, an adenilate cyclase inhibitor, significantly caused marked inhibition of T. cruzi infection. In contrast, aspirin (ASA, a non-selective COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor) treatment did not inhibit the infection of the cells by the parasite and was independent of nitric oxide (NO) production. The expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 were similar on cells treated or not with both COX-inhibitors. The infection stimulated the release of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 production by infected cells. Treatment with ASA or CEL did not affect TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and NO production by infected cells, but increased IL-1β production by them. Our results suggest a key role of COX-2 and cAMP pathways in T. cruzi invasion process of human blood cells and these pathways may represent targets of new therapeutic options for Cd. © 2017 Lonien, Malvezi, Suzukawa, Yamauchi, Yamada-Ogatta, Rizzo, Bordignon and Pinge-Filho.

AB  - Chagas disease is an endemic parasitic infection that occurs in 21 Latin American countries. New therapies for this disease are urgently needed, as the only two drugs available (nifurtimox and benznidazol) have high toxicity and variable efficacy in the disease’s chronic phase. Recently, a new chemical entity (NCE) named Pyranaphthoquinone (IVS320) was synthesized from lawsone. We report herein, a detailed study of the physicochemical properties and in vitro trypanocidal activity of IVS320. A series of assays were performed for characterization, where thermal, diffractometric, and morphological analysis were performed. In addition, the solubility, permeability, and hygroscopicity of IVS320 were determined. The results show that its poor solubility and low permeability may be due to its high degree of crystallinity (99.19%), which might require the use of proper techniques to increase the IVS320’s aqueous solubility and permeability. The trypanocidal activity study demonstrated that IVS320 is more potent than the reference drug benznidazole, with IC50/24 h of 1.49 ± 0.1 µM, which indicates that IVS320 has potential as a new drug candidate for the treatment of Chagas disease. © 2017 by the authors

AB  - Background: Experimental and clinical studies have shown that myenteric neuron cell death during infection with Trypanosoma cruzi mainly occurs in the esophagus and colon, resulting in megaesophagus and megacolon, respectively. Evidence suggests that the cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX) is involved in the T. cruzi invasion process. The use of low-dose aspirin (ASA), a COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor, has been shown to reduce infection with T. cruzi. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effects of treatment with low-dose ASA on myenteric colonic neurons during murine infection with T. cruzi. Methods: Swiss mice were assigned into groups treated with either phosphate-buffered saline or low doses of ASA during the acute phase (20 mg/kg ASA) and chronic phase (50 mg/kg ASA) of infection with the Y strain of T. cruzi. Seventy-five days after infection, colon samples were collected to quantify inflammatory foci in histological sections and also general (myosin-V+), nitrergic, and VIPergic myenteric neurons in whole mounts. Gastrointestinal transit time was also measured. Key Results: Aspirin treatment during the acute phase of infection reduced parasitemia (P&lt;.05). Aspirin treatment during the acute or chronic phase of the infection reduced the intensity of inflammatory foci in the colon, protected myenteric neurons from cell death and plastic changes, and recovered the gastrointestinal transit of mice infected with T. cruzi (P&lt;.05). Conclusion &amp; Inferences: Early and delayed treatment with low-dose ASA can reduce the morphofunctional damage of colonic myenteric neurons caused by murine T. cruzi infection. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Background: Measurement of changes in health across locations is useful to compare and contrast changing epidemiological patterns against health system performance and identify specific needs for resource allocation in research, policy development, and programme decision making. Using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we drew from two widely used summary measures to monitor such changes in population health: disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We used these measures to track trends and benchmark progress compared with expected trends on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Methods: We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost and years of life lived with disability for each location, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using age-specific death rates and years of life lived with disability per capita. We explored how DALYs and HALE difered from expected trends when compared with the SDI: the geometric mean of income per person, educational attainment in the population older than age 15 years, and total fertility rate. Findings: The highest globally observed HALE at birth for both women and men was in Singapore, at 75·2 years (95% uncertainty interval 71·9-78·6) for females and 72·0 years (68·8-75·1) for males. The lowest for females was in the Central African Republic (45·6 years [42·0-49·5]) and for males was in Lesotho (41·5 years [39·0-44·0]). From 1990 to 2016, global HALE increased by an average of 6·24 years (5·97-6·48) for both sexes combined. Global HALE increased by 6·04 years (5·74-6·27) for males and 6·49 years (6·08-6·77) for females, whereas HALE at age 65 years increased by 1·78 years (1·61-1·93) for males and 1·96 years (1·69-2·13) for females. Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2016 (-2·3% [-5·9 to 0·9]), with decreases in communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) disease DALYs ofset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The exemplars, calculated as the fve lowest ratios of observed to expected age-standardised DALY rates in 2016, were Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Maldives, Peru, and Israel. The leading three causes of DALYs globally were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and lower respiratory infections, comprising 16·1% of all DALYs. Total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most CMNN causes decreased from 1990 to 2016. Conversely, the total DALY burden rose for most NCDs; however, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined globally. Interpretation: At a global level, DALYs and HALE continue to show improvements. At the same time, we observe that many populations are facing growing functional health loss. Rising SDI was associated with increases in cumulative years of life lived with disability and decreases in CMNN DALYs ofset by increased NCD DALYs. Relative compression of morbidity highlights the importance of continued health interventions, which has changed in most locations in pace with the gross domestic product per person, education, and family planning. The analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework with which to benchmark location-specific health performance. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform health policies, health system improvement initiatives, targeted prevention eforts, and development assistance for health, including fnancial and research investments for all countries, regardless of their level of sociodemographic development. The presence of countries that substantially outperform others suggests the need for increased scrutiny for proven examples of best practices, which can help to extend gains, whereas the presence of underperforming countries suggests the need for devotion of extra attention to health systems that need more robust support. © The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specifc mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. Methods: We estimated cause-specifc deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specifc causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specifc deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. Findings: The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72·3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71·2-73·2) of deaths in 2016 with 19·3% (18·5-20·4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8·43% (8·00-8·67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16 - age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1·80 million deaths (95% UI 1·59 million to 1·89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in ages 90-94 years and a 210% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL signifcantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2·89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1·59%) during the same interval. Globally, the fve leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a fner level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. Interpretation: The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and confict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might refect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which efective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

AB  - As the official journal of the Goiás Medical Association, the Revista Goiana de Medicina transcended its original frontiers and became a vehicle for disseminating medical research by doctors from Central Brazil, giving them a high level of visibility. The editorial emphasis on Chagas disease, a serious rural endemic that threatened the interior of the country in the mid-twentieth century, is identified as a determining factor in the prominence achieved by them. Setting out from an analysis of articles and institutional correspondence, and taking the journal in question as both the source and object of research, the article reflects simultaneously on the importance of the Goiás medical journal for the institutionalization of local medicine and its relevance among scholars of American trypanosomiasis.

AB  - Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a neglected tropical disease caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite. In order to develop diagnostic and therapeutic solutions, there has been an intense investigation on the parasite biology using omics technologies such as genomics, transcriptomics lipidomics and proteomics. In particular, large scale mass spectrometry-based proteomics studies have allowed the identification and quantification of proteins and selected PTMs in different biological conditions. In this study, we investigated the unassigned MS/MS spectra commonly observed in large scale bottom up proteomics experiments looking at the T. cruzi (Sylvio X10/1) proteome. A deep proteomics data analysis using proteogenomic and unrestrictive PTMs search approaches allowed us to annotate 30% more MS/MS spectra and identify novel DNA coding regions and uncharacterized PTMs in Trypanosomatids, such as protein arginylation. Overall, this study shows: (1) the importance of assigning protein modifications, analytical artefacts and PTMs, in large-scale mass spectrometry-based proteomics data to deeply profile the trypanosomatids proteome. (2) The need of a better characterization of the influence of sample preparation steps on the identification of proteins and protein modifications. (3) The identification of novel DNA coding regions in T. cruzi. (4) The discovery of protein arginylation in trypanosomatids. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC) is one of the chronic manifestations of Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) infection and is a major public health disease in Latin America. Since it is a chronic systemic infection, Chagas disease was long considered a potential contraindication for transplantation because of the risk of recurrence with immunosuppression. However, early South American experience in the 1980's established the feasibility of heart transplantation (HT) in patients with Chagas disease. Indeed, the first cardiac transplant for a recipient with CC was performed in 1985 in Brazil. Chagas etiology of heart failure has become the third most common indication for HT in South America. T. cruzi reactivation post-transplant is a common issue that requires prophylactic surveillance but responds well to appropriate therapy. Chagas reactivation has been associated with the potency of the immunosuppressive protocol and occurs more frequently after rejection episodes. Yet, many important questions regarding the management of Chagas HT candidates and recipients remain unanswered. For example, biventricular systolic failure is frequent in end-stage CC, but its impact on the modality of mechanical circulatory bridging has not been described. Also, there is no consensus regarding the most adequate immunosuppressive regimen that balances the risk of graft rejection and disease reactivation. The real efficacy and safety of HT for end-stage CC will only be appreciated when a Latin American transplant registry is established. This review covers the current state of the art of HT for CC. © 2017 International Society for the Heart and Lung Transplantation

AB  - Background: Major drawbacks of the available treatment against Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) include its toxicity and therapeutic inefficiency in the chronic phase of the infection, which makes it a concern among neglected diseases. Therefore, the discovery of alternative drugs for treating chronic Chagas disease requires immediate action. In this work, we evaluated the mushroom Pleurotus salmoneostramineus in the search for potential antiparasitic compounds. Methods: Fruit bodies of the basidiomycete Pleurotus salmoneostramineus were triturated and submitted to organic solvent extraction. After liquid-liquid partition of the crude extract, three fractions were obtained and the bioguided fractionation study was conducted to isolate the active metabolites. The elucidation of the chemical structure was performed using GC-MS and NMR techniques. The biological assays for antiparasitic activity were carried out using trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi and murine macrophages for mammalian cytotoxicity. The mechanism of action of the isolated compound used different fluorescent probes to evaluate the plasma membrane permeability, the potential of the mitochondrial membrane and the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Results: The most abundant fraction showing the antiparasitic activity was isolated and chemically elucidated, confirming the presence of ergosterol. It showed anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity against trypomastigotes, with an IC50 value of 51.3 μg/mL. The compound demonstrated no cytotoxicity against mammalian cells to the maximal tested concentration of 200 μg/mL. The mechanism of action of ergosterol in Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes resulted in permeabilization of the plasma membrane, as well as depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to parasite death. Nevertheless, no increase in ROS levels could be observed, suggesting damages to plasma membrane rather than an induction of oxidative stress in the parasite. Conclusions: The selection of naturally antiparasitic secondary metabolites in basidiomycetes, such as ergosterol, may provide potential scaffolds for drug design studies against neglected diseases. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of American trypanosomiasis has broad biological and genetic diversity. Remaining to be studied are polymorphisms of the blood forms and metacyclogenesis of different T. cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs). Our goal was to evaluate the relationship between T. cruzi DTUs, the morphology of blood trypomastigotes, and in vitro metacyclogenesis. T. cruzi strains that pertained to DTUs TcI, TcII, and TcIV from different Brazilian states were used. Parameters that were related to the morphology of eight strains were assessed in thin blood smears that were obtained from mice that were inoculated with blood or culture forms, depending on strain. The metacyclogenesis of 12 strains was measured using smears with Liver Infusion Tryptose culture medium and M16 culture medium (which is poor in nutrients and has a low pH) at the exponential phase of growth, both stained with Giemsa. The morphological pattern of TcII strains was consistent with broad forms of the parasite. In TcIV strains, slender forms predominated. The Y strain (TcII) was morphologically more similar to TcIV. Significant differences in polymorphisms were observed between DTUs. Metacyclogenesis parameters, although displaying large standard deviations, differed between the DTUs, with the following descending rank order: TcII > TcI > TcIV. The mean numbers of metacyclic trypomastigotes for TcII were significantly higher than the other DTUs. Although the DTUs presented overlapping characteristics, the general pattern was that different DTUs exhibited significantly different morphologies and metacyclogenesis, suggesting that the genetic diversity of T. cruzi could be related to parameters that are associated with the evolution of infection in mammalian hosts and its ability to disperse in nature. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Oral transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is the most important route of infection in Brazilian Amazon and Venezuela. Other South American countries have also reported outbreaks associated with food consumption. A recent study showed the importance of parasite contact with oral cavity to induce a highly severe acute disease in mice. However, it remains uncertain the primary site of parasite entry and multiplication due to an oral infection. Here, we evaluated the presence of T. cruzi Dm28c luciferase (Dm28c-luc) parasites in orally infected mice, by bioluminescence and quantitative real-time PCR. In vivo bioluminescent images indicated the nasomaxillary region as the site of parasite invasion in the host, becoming consistently infected throughout the acute phase. At later moments, 7 and 21 days post-infection (dpi), luminescent signal is denser in the thorax, abdomen and genital region, because of parasite dissemination in different tissues. Ex vivo analysis demonstrated that the nasomaxillary region, heart, mandibular lymph nodes, liver, spleen, brain, epididymal fat associated to male sex organs, salivary glands, cheek muscle, mesenteric fat and lymph nodes, stomach, esophagus, small and large intestine are target tissues at latter moments of infection. In the same line, amastigote nests of Dm28c GFP T. cruzi were detected in the nasal cavity of 6 dpi mice. Parasite quantification by real-time qPCR at 7 and 21 dpi showed predominant T. cruzi detection and expansion in mouse nasal cavity. Moreover, T. cruzi DNA was also observed in the mandibular lymph nodes, pituitary gland, heart, liver, small intestine and spleen at 7 dpi, and further, disseminated to other tissues, such as the brain, stomach, esophagus and large intestine at 21 dpi. Our results clearly demonstrated that oral cavity and adjacent compartments is the main target region in oral T. cruzi infection leading to parasite multiplication at the nasal cavity. © 2017 Silva-dos-Santos et al.

AB  - Congenital infection of Trypanosoma cruzi allows transmission of this parasite through generations. Despite the problematic that this entails, little is known about the placenta environment genetic response produced against infection. We performed functional genomics by microarray analysis in C57Bl/6J mice comparing placentas from uninfected animals and from animals infected with two different T. cruzi strains: K98, a clone of the non-lethal myotropic CA-I strain (TcI), and VD (TcVI), isolated from a human case of congenital infection. Analysis of networks by GeneMANIA of differentially expressed genes showed that “Secretory Granule” was a pathway down-regulated in both infected groups, whereas “Innate Immune Response” and “Response to Interferon-gamma” were pathways up-regulated in VD infection but not in K98. Applying another approach, the GSEA algorithm that detects small changes in predetermined gene sets, we found that metabolic processes, transcription and macromolecular transport were down-regulated in infected placentas environment and some pathways related to cascade signaling had opposite regulation: over-represented in VD and down-regulated in K98 group. We also have found a stronger tropism to the placental organ by VD strain, by detection of parasite DNA and RNA, suggesting living parasites. Our study is the first one to describe in a murine model the genetic response of placental environment to T. cruzi infection and suggests the development of a strong immune response, parasite genotype-dependent, to the detriment of cellular metabolism, which may contribute to control infection preventing the risk of congenital transmission. © 2017 Juiz et al.

AB  - Introduction: American tripanosomiasis (Chagas disease), the second most neglected disease in the world, is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Though natural transmission by insect vectors has been controlled, there is significant risk of T. cruzi transmission by blood transfusion in non-endemic regions, generally due to immigration processes from endemic areas. Methodology: The objective of this study was to evaluate anti-T. cruzi seroprevalence in blood donors from the western part of São Paulo State, Brazil, by serologic and immunofluorescence confirmation tests for the period between 2012 and 2014. Currently, this region is regarded as a non-endemic area for Chagas disease. Results: The confirmed overall T. cruzi seroprevalence among blood donors was 0.10%, which can be considered low compared to other Brazilian regions. Nevertheless, the distribution of the anti-T. cruzi antibodies within the examined region was uneven, and some areas of significantly higher prevalence were observed. Conclusions: We could consider two tendencies in the prevalence of T. cruzi: (i) residual older undiagnosed cases from São Paulo State, and (ii) immigration from endemic Brazilian or South American regions. The discordance obtained for T. cruzi prevalence by serologic and immunofluorescence methods demonstrates that more specific routine diagnosis is needed to diminish the cost of the assays and the loss of blood supply once all seropositive blood bags are immediately discarded. © 2017 Slavov et al.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects 7 million people in Latin American areas of endemicity. About 30% of infected patients will develop chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), an inflammatory cardiomyopathy characterized by hypertrophy, fibrosis, and myocarditis. Further studies are necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms of disease progression. Transcriptome analysis has been increasingly used to identify molecular changes associated with disease outcomes. We thus assessed the whole-blood transcriptome of patients with Chagas disease. Microarray analysis was performed on blood samples from 150 subjects, of whom 30 were uninfected control patients and 120 had Chagas disease (1 group had asymptomatic disease, and 2 groups had CCC with either a preserved or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]). Each Chagas disease group displayed distinct gene expression and functional pathway profiles. The most different expression patterns were between CCC groups with a preserved or reduced LVEF. A more stringent analysis indicated that 27 differentially expressed genes, particularly those related to natural killer (NK)/CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity, separated the 2 groups. NK/CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity could play a role in determining Chagas disease progression. Understanding genes associated with disease may lead to improved insight into CCC pathogenesis and the identification of prognostic factors for CCC progression. © The Author 2016.

AB  - American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) (also known as cutaneous leishmaniasis [CL]) is caused by various species of protozoa of the genus Leishmania. The diagnosis is achieved on a clinical, epidemiological, and pathological basis, supported by positive parasitological exams and demonstration of leishmanin delayedtype hypersensitivity. Serological assays are not routinely used in the diagnosis because many are considered to have low sensitivity and the particular Leishmania species causing the disease can lead to variable performance. In the present study, we generated recombinant versions of two highly conserved Leishmania proteins, Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis-derived Lb8E and Lb6H, and evaluated both in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Recombinant Lb6H (rLb6H) had better performance and reacted with 100.0% of the ATL and 89.4% of the VL samples. These reactions with rLb6H were highly specific (98.5%) when compared against those for samples from healthy control individuals. We then assessed rLb6H against sera from ATL patients infected with different species of Leishmania prevalent in Brazil [Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis, L. (Viannia) braziliensis, and L. (V.) guyanensis] and samples from patients with other infectious diseases. In analyses of 500 sera, ELISA using rLb6H detected all 219 ATL samples (sensitivity of 100.0%) with an overall specificity of 93.9% (considering healthy individuals and other infectious diseases patients). Only a minority of samples from Chagas disease patients possessed antibodies against rLb6H, and all of these responses were low (with a highest reactivity index of 2.2). Taken together, our data support further evaluation of rLb6H and the potential for its routine use in the serological diagnosis of ATL. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - A new epidemiological view of American trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease has been formulated in recent decades. Oral transmission of the etiological agent of Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, has been the most common form of transmission. The T. cruzi discrete typing units TcI and TcIV have been involved in tens outbreaks of acute cases of Chagas disease in the Brazilian Amazon region. We investigated the intensity of infection in mice that were orally inoculated (OR group) with four strains of TcIV that were isolated from two outbreaks of acute Chagas disease that was orally acquired in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. We compared the OR group with mice that were intraperitoneally inoculated (IP group). Blood samples were analyzed by fresh blood examination, hemoculture, and conventional and qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Samples of different tissues were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The OR group exhibited a higher maximum peak of parasitemia, greater rates of positivity, and higher parasite loads in different tissues during acute infection compared with the IP group, indicating a greater intensity of orally acquired infection. Mice that were orally inoculated with TcIV strains that were obtained from two outbreaks of orally acquired Chagas disease in Amazonas, Brazil, exhibited a more intense course of infection compared with intraperitoneally inoculated mice, reflected by higher levels of parasitemia and parasite loads. © 2016

AB  - Diagnostic tools are important for clinical management and epidemiological evaluation of Tegumentary (TL) and Visceral (VL) Leishmaniasis. Serology is not frequently used for the diagnosis of the TL form because low antibody titers and cross-reaction with VL. Therefore, it is crucial to identify specific and immunogenic antigens from species associated with the TL form. Here we employed a proteomic approach coupled to an in silico analysis and identified the most abundant and immunogenic proteins from Leishmania amazonensis, Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania infantum. Of 16 species specific proteins, nine were from the species causative of the TL form (L. amazonensis and L. braziliensis). In silico analysis revealed 18 B-cell epitopes with 0% similarity to Trypanosoma cruzi orthologs and, therefore, less likely to crossreact with sera of patients with Chagas disease. Two proteins reacted exclusively with serum from TL patients and presented several B-cell epitopes without similarity to T. cruzi orthologs: the hypothetical protein GI 134063939 and the metallo-peptidase Clan MA(E)-Family M3. The immunoassay revealed nine peptides with strong reactivity to sera from TL patients. These proteins and peptides may be good candidates to improve the specificity and sensibility of serological tests aiming to diagnose the TL of this neglected human disease. Biological significance As no gold-standard test for tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) exists, a combination of different diagnostic techniques is often necessary to obtain precise results. Thus, the identification of species-specific, highly immunogenic and abundant proteins that stimulate the humoral immune response in the host should help in the development of serological tests for human TL. Herein we searched for these potential antigens in Leishmania species related to American Leishmaniasis (L. amazonensis, L. braziliensis and L. infantum). To this end, we employed an immunoproteomic approach using proteins from these Leishmania species and sera from TL and Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) patients. Our study unveils specific proteins and peptides that may represent antigens that will help the efforts to improve the accuracy of serological tests to diagnose the TL form. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chagas' disease is an important cause of cardiomyopathy in Latin America. We aimed to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction caused by Chagas' disease, with other etiologies, in the era of modern HF therapies. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 2552 Latin American patients randomized in the PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) and ATMOSPHERE (Aliskiren Trial to Minimize Outcomes in Patients With Heart Failure) trials. The investigator-reported etiology was categorized as Chagasic, other nonischemic, or ischemic cardiomyopathy. The outcomes of interest included the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization and its components and death from any cause. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were performed to compare outcomes by pathogenesis. There were 195 patients with Chagasic HF with reduced ejection fraction, 1300 with other nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and 1057 with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Compared with other etiologies, Chagasic patients were more often female, younger, and had lower prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and renal impairment (but had higher prevalence of stroke and pacemaker implantation) and had worse health-related quality of life. The rates of the composite outcome were 17.2, 12.5, and 11.4 per 100 person-years for Chagasic, other nonischemic, and ischemic patients, respectively-adjusted hazard ratio for Chagasic versus other nonischemic: 1.49 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.94; P=0.003) and Chagasic versus ischemic: 1.55 (1.18-2.04; P=0.002). The rates of allcause mortality were also higher. CONCLUSIONS: Despite younger age, less comorbidity, and comprehensive use of conventional HF therapies, patients with Chagasic HF with reduced ejection fraction continue to have worse quality of life and higher hospitalization and mortality rates compared with other etiologies. © 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - Objective. Describe a tool to estimate demand for benznidazole and nifurtimox to treat Chagas disease, and report on its implementation in a group of Latin American countries. Methods. The project was carried out in the following stages: 1) development of a tool to estimate demand, and definition of the evaluation and decision variables to estimate demand 2) data collection via a questionnaire completed by representatives of control programs, complemented with data from the literature; 3) presentation of the tool, followed by validation, and adaptation by representatives of the control programs in order to plan drug procurement for 2012 and 2013; and 4) further analysis of the obtained data, especially regarding benznidazole, and comparison of country estimates. Results. Fourteen endemic countries of Latin America took part in the third stage, and a consolidated estimate was made. The number of estimated treatments, based on the number of tablets per treatment established in the regimen of reference was: 867 in the group under 1 year of age; 2 042 835 in the group from 1 to 15 years old; 2 028 in the group from 15 to 20 years old; and 10 248 in adults over 20. This means that it is possible to provide benznidazole to less than 1% of people for whom treatment is indicated. Conclusions. The development and systematic use of demand management tools can play a key role in helping to provide access to the anti-Chagas drugs. There is a significant gap between the projected demand for drugs and current estimates of prevalence rates.

AB  - BACKGROUND The Trypanosoma cruzi infection endemic in Latin America has now spread to several countries across four continents; this endemic involves triatomine vector-free protists. We hypothesised that the sexual transmission of T. cruzi contributes to the ongoing spread of Chagas disease. OBJECTIVES A short-term longitudinal study was conducted to evaluate this hypothesis. METHODS The study population comprised 109 subjects from four families, among whom 21 had been diagnosed with acute Chagas disease by direct parasitological analysis. Blood mononuclear cells and serum samples were obtained from each study subject once per year for three consecutive years. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence serological examinations were used to detect specific T. cruzi antibodies. Polymerase chain reaction of T. cruzi DNA revealed 188-nucleotide bands, which hybridised to a specific radiolabelled probe and were confirmed by cloning and sequencing. RESULTS Three independent assessments at different time points revealed T. cruzi nuclear DNA footprints in 76% (83/109) of the study population with active infection. In contrast, the ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence assays detected the T. cruzi antibody in 28.4% (31/109) of the study samples. Moreover, the semen from 82.6% (19/23) of subjects people revealed harboured the 188-bp base pair T. cruzi footprint. Interestingly, the ejaculates of nuclear DNA-positive Chagas patient transmitted the T. cruzi upon peritoneal injection or infusion in the vagina of mice, and amastigotes were detected in the skeletal muscle, myocardium, vas deferens, and uterine tube. MAIN CONCLUSIONS T. cruzi infections can be transmitted from females or males to naïve mates through intercourse, and progeny showed discrepancies between the ratios of nuclear DNA footprints and specific antibody that can be explained by the tolerance attained during early embryo growth. Additional studies are needed to develop drugs to eradicate the infections. Additionally, the importance of a vigorous education, information, and communication program to prevent sexually transmitted Chagas disease in humans cannot be underemphasised. © 2017, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Facultad de Agronomia e Ingenieria Forestal.

AB  - Introduction: Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of Chagas disease in humans, mainly in Latin America. Trypanosome stocks were isolated by hemoculture from patients followed at Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (FIOCRUZ) and studied using different approaches. Methods: For species and genotype identification, the stocks were analyzed by parasitological techniques, polymerase chain reaction assays targeted to specific DNA sequences, isoenzyme patterns, besides sequencing of a polymorphic locus of TcSC5D gene (one stock). Results: The isolates presented typical T. cruzi morphology and usually grew well in routine culture media. Metacyclic trypomastigotes were found in cultures or experimentally infected Triatoma infestans. All isolates were pure T. cruzi cultures, presenting typical 330-bp products from kinetoplast DNA minicircles, and 250 or 200-bp amplicons from the mini-exon non-transcribed spacer. Their genetic type assignment was resolved by their isoenzyme profiles. The finding of TcI in one asymptomatic patient from Paraíba was confirmed by the sequencing assay. TcVI was found in two asymptomatic individuals from Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul. TcII was identified in six patients from Pernambuco, Bahia and Minas Gerais, who presented different clinical forms: cardiac (2), digestive with megaesophagus (1), and indeterminate (3). Conclusions: The main T. cruzi genotypes found in Brazilian chronic patients were identified in this work, including TcI, which is less frequent and usually causes asymptomatic disease, unlike that in other American countries. This study emphasizes the importance of T. cruzi genotyping for possible correlations between the parasite and patient’ responses to therapeutic treatment or disease clinical manifestations. © 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

AB  - Luehea species are found in almost all Central and South American countries. The present work describes the phytochemical study, isolation, and structural characterisation of friedelin, β-friedelinol, lupeol, pseudotaraxasterol, β-sitosterol, betulinic acid, taraxasterol, (−)-epicatechin, β-sitosterol-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, and (+)-epicatechin-(4β→8)-epicatechin from stem barks of Luehea ochrophylla Mart. The structural identification of the isolated compounds was mainly performed by NMR analyses and comparison with the data from literature. These compounds were isolated for the first time in the genus Luehea, except β-sitosterol glucopyranoside, (−)-epicatechin, and lupeol. Hexane extract (HE) and dichloromethane (DF) and ethyl acetate (AF) fractions exhibited antiparasitic activity against amastigote (intracellular) and trypomastigote culture forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. The ethanol extract (EE), DF, and ethanol fraction (EF) exhibited considerable antifungal activity against Candida albicans. Moreover, extracts and fractions exhibited significant percentage of capture free radicals of 2,2-diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) when compared to the standard of ascorbic acid. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Chagas disease is a neglected chronic condition with a high burden of morbidity and mortality. It has considerable psychological, social, and economic impacts. The disease represents a significant public health issue in Brazil, with different regional patterns. This document presents the evidence that resulted in the Brazilian Consensus on Chagas Disease. The objective was to review and standardize strategies for diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control of Chagas disease in the country, based on the available scientific evidence. The consensus is based on the articulation and strategic contribution of renowned Brazilian experts with knowledge and experience on various aspects of the disease. It is the result of a close collaboration between the Brazilian Society of Tropical Medicine and the Ministry of Health. It is hoped that this document will strengthen the development of integrated actions against Chagas disease in the country, focusing on epidemiology, management, comprehensive care (including families and communities), communication, information, education, and research. © 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

AB  - Objectives. Prenatal care is a pillar of public health, enabling access to interventions including prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and congenital syphilis. This paper describes social factors related to use of prenatal care in Ecuador. Methods. In 2011 and 2012, participant clinical history and interview information was analyzed from a national probability sample of 5 998 women presenting for delivery or miscarriage services in 15 healthcare facilities in Ecuador, to estimate prevalence of HIV, syphilis, and Chagas disease, and prenatal care coverage. Results. The study found that 94.1% of women had attended at least one prenatal visit, but that attendance at no less than four visits was 73.1%. Furthermore, lower educational level, greater number of pregnancies, occupation in the agriculture or livestock sector, and membership in ethnic indigenous, Afro-Ecuadorian, or other minority groups were factors associated with lack of use (no prenatal visits) or insufficient use of prenatal care (fewer than four visits or first visit at >20 weeks gestation) in Ecuador. Conclusions. These results point to persistence of marked inequalities in access to and use of prenatal health services attributable to socioeconomic factors and to the need to strengthen strategies to address them, to reach the goal of universal prenatal care coverage.

AB  - Chagas’ disease, affecting up to 6–7 million people worldwide, is transmitted to humans through the feces of triatomine kissing bugs. From these, Rhodnius prolixus, Triatoma dimidiata, Triatoma infestans and Triatoma pallidipennis are important vectors distributed throughout the Latin American subcontinent. Resistance to pyrethroids has been developed by some triatomine populations, especially T. infestans, obstructing their control. Given their role in the regulation of physiological processes, neuroendocrine-derived factors have been proposed as a source of molecular targets for new-generation insecticides. However, the involvement of neuropeptides in insecticide metabolism and resistance in insects has been poorly studied. In the present work, the sequences of 20 neuropeptide precursor genes in T. infestans, 16 in T. dimidiata, and 13 in T. pallidipennis detected in transcriptomic databases are reported, and a comparative analysis in triatomines is presented. A total of 59 neuropeptides were validated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in brain and nervous ganglia from T. infestans, revealing the existence of differential post-translational modifications, extended and truncated forms. The results suggest a high sequence conservation in some neuropeptide systems in triatomines, whereas remarkable differences occur in several others within the core domains. Comparisons of the basal expression levels for several neuropeptide precursor genes between pyrethroid sensitive and resistant population of T. infestans are also presented here, in order to introduce a proof of concept to test the involvement of neuropeptides in insecticide resistance. From the precursors tested, NVP and ITG peptides are significantly higher expressed in the resistant population. To our knowledge, this is the first report to associate differential neuropeptide expression with insecticide resistance. The information provided here contributes to creating conditions to widely extend functional and genetic studies involving neuropeptides in triatomines. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The subfamily Triatominae (Hemiptera, Reduviidae) includes 150 species of blood-sucking insects, vectors of Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis. Karyotypic information reveals a striking stability in the number of autosomes. However, this group shows substantial variability in genome size, the amount and distribution of C-heterochromatin, and the chromosome positions of 45S rDNA clusters. Here, we analysed the karyotypes of 41 species from six different genera with C-fluorescence banding in order to evaluate the base-pair richness of heterochromatic regions. Our results show a high heterogeneity in the fluorescent staining of the heterochromatin in both autosomes and sex chromosomes, never reported before within an insect subfamily with holocentric chromosomes. This technique allows a clear discrimination of the heterochromatic regions classified as similar by C-banding, constituting a new chromosome marker with taxonomic and evolutionary significance. The diverse fluorescent patterns are likely due to the amplification of different repeated sequences, reflecting an unusual dynamic rearrangement in the genomes of this subfamily. Further, we discuss the evolution of these repeated sequences in both autosomes and sex chromosomes in species of Triatominae. © 2016, Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The effects of exercise training on Chagas heart disease are still unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of exercise training over functional capacity, cardiac function, quality of life, and biomarkers in Chagas heart disease. Methods: The PEACH study is a superiority randomized clinical trial which will include subjects who meet the following criteria: Chagas heart disease with a left ventricular ejection fraction below 45 % with or without heart failure symptoms; clinical stability in the last 3 months; adherence to clinical treatment; and age above 18 years. The exclusion criteria are: pregnancy; neuromuscular limitations; smoking; evidence of non-chagasic heart disease; systemic conditions that limit exercise practice or cardiopulmonary exercise test; unavailability to attend the center three times a week during the intervention period; and practitioners of regular exercise. The intervention group will perform an exercise training intervention three times per week during 6 months and will be compared to the control group without exercise. Both groups will undergo the same monthly pharmaceutical and nutritional counseling as well as standard medical treatment according to the Brazilian consensus on Chagas disease. The primary outcome is functional capacity based on peak exercise oxygen consumption during cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Secondary outcomes are: cardiac function; body composition; muscle respiratory strength; microvascular reactivity; cardiac rhythm abnormalities; autonomic function; biochemical; oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers; and quality of life. Subjects will be evaluated at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months after randomization. Thirty patients will be randomly assigned into exercise or control groups at a ratio of 1:1. Discussion: Findings of the present study will be useful to determine if physical exercise programs should be included as an important additional therapy in the treatment of patients with Chagas heart disease.

AB  - The brasiliensis complex is composed of five triatomine species, and different approaches suggest that Triatoma lenti and Triatoma petrochiae may be the new members. Therefore, this study sought to analyze the phylogenetic relationships within this complex by means of the D2 region of the 28S RNA gene, and to analyze the degree of polymorphism and phylogenetic significance of this gene for South American triatomines. Phylogenetic analysis by using sequence fragments of the D2 domain did not allow to perform phylogenetic inferences on species within the brasiliensis complex, because the gene alignment composed of a matrix with 37 specimens exhibited only two variable sites along the 567 base pairs used. Furthermore, if all South American species are included, only four variable sites were detected, reflecting the high degree of gene conservation. Therefore, we do not recommend the use of this gene for phylogenetic reconstruction for this group of Chagas disease vectors. © Copyright 2016 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB  - Trypanosomatids are parasitic protozoa with a significant burden on human health. African and American trypanosomes are causative agents of Nagana and Chagas disease respectively, and speciated about 300 million years ago. These parasites have highly distinct life cycles, pathologies, transmission strategies and surface proteomes, being dominated by the variant surface glycoprotein (African) or mucins (American) respectively. In African trypanosomes clathrin-mediated trafficking is responsible for endocytosis and post-Golgi transport, with several mechanistic aspects distinct from higher organisms. Using clathrin light chain (TcCLC) and EpsinR (TcEpsinR) as affinity handles, we identified candidate clathrin-associated proteins (CAPs) in Trypanosoma cruzi; the cohort includes orthologs of many proteins known to mediate vesicle trafficking, but significantly not the AP-2 adaptor complex. Several trypanosome-specific proteins common with African trypanosomes, were also identified. Fluorescence microscopy revealed localisations for TcEpsinR, TcCLC and TcCHC at the posterior region of trypomastigote cells, coincident with the flagellar pocket and Golgi apparatus. These data provide the first systematic analysis of clathrin-mediated trafficking in T. cruzi, allowing comparison between protein cohorts and other trypanosomes and also suggest that clathrin trafficking in at least some life stages of T. cruzi may be AP-2-independent.

AB  - Chagas disease represents a serious burden for millions of people worldwide. Transmitted by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, this neglected tropical disease causes more than 10,000 deaths each year and is the main cause of heart failure in Latin America, where it is endemic. Although most cases are concentrated in Latin American countries, Chagas disease has been increasingly reported in non-endemic regions, where the low level of public awareness on the subject contributes to the growing prevalence of the disease. The available medicines are characterized by several safety and efficacy drawbacks that prevent millions of people, particularly those with advanced disease, from receiving adequate treatment. This urgent need has stimulated the emergence of diverse initiatives dedicated to the research and development (R&D) of novel therapeutic agents for Chagas disease. Public-private partnerships have been responsible for a significant increase in the investments in R&D programs and major advancements have been achieved over the past ten years. A number of collaborative projects have been leveraged by this organizational model, which privileges sharing of data, expertise, and resources between research institutions and pharmaceutical companies. Among the current strategies employed by these consortia, target-based and phenotypic screenings have achieved the most promising results. This article provides an overview on the current status and recent advances in Chagas disease drug discovery. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease), which affects 6-7 million people worldwide, mainly in Latin America. It presents great genetic and biological variability that plays an important role in the clinical and epidemiological features of the disease. Our working hypothesis is that the genetic diversity of T. cruzi has an important impact on detection of the parasite using diagnostic techniques. The present study evaluated the diagnostic performance of parasitological, molecular, and serological techniques for detecting 27 strains of T. cruzi that belonged to discrete typing units (DTUs) TcI (11 strains), TcII (four strains), and TcIV (12 strains) that were obtained from different hosts in the states of Amazonas and Paraná, Brazil. Blood samples were taken from experimentally infected mice and analyzed by fresh blood examination, hemoculture in Liver Infusion Tryptose (LIT) medium, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Polymerase chain reaction presented the best detection of TcI, with 80.4% positivity. For all of the detection methods, the animals that were inoculated with TcII presented the highest positivity rates (94.1-100%). ELISA that was performed 7 months after inoculation presented a higher detection ability (95.4%) for TcIV. Intra-DTU comparisons showed that the reproducibility of the majority of the results that were obtained with the different methods was weak for TcI and good for TcII and TcIV. Our data indicate that the detection capability of different techniques varies with the DTUs of the parasites in mammalian blood. The implications of these findings with regard to the diagnosis of human T. cruzi infection are discussed. © 2016 .

AB  - Chagas' disease is a chronic illness caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. According to estimates, approximately 16-18 million people are infected in Latin American. Plant extracts exhibit a wide variety of secondary metabolites and can play an important role in the discovery of new compounds with biological potential. The in vitro trypanocidal activity of the extracts obtained from six plant species collected in Egypt (Parkia africana, Parkia roxburgi, Lagerstromeia speciosa, Schinopsis lorentzii, Lagerstromeia indica, and Sapindus saponaria) was assayed against trypomastigote and amastigote forms of T. cruzi. The cytotoxic activity of the most active extract was also evaluated by conducting MTT assays. S. lorentzii and S. saponaria were the most active extracts against the trypomastigote form;IC50 values were 9.9 and 27.34 μg/mL, respectively. The S. lorentzii extract was also evaluated against the amastigote form (IC50 was 111.5 μg/mL).The S. lorentzii extract did not exhibit significant cytotoxic activity. The selectivity index value indicated that this extract was highly selective for the parasite. The S. lorentzii and S. saponariaextracts exhibit trypanocidal activity, probably as a result of the presence ofdifferent constituentsand their concentrations in the extracts. © 2016 Khaled Rashed et al.

AB  - Background: The influence of genetic ancestry on Trypanosoma cruzi infection and Chagas disease outcomes is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used 370,539 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to examine the association between individual proportions of African, European and Native American genomic ancestry with T. cruzi infection and related outcomes in 1,341 participants (aged ≥ 60 years) of the Bambui (Brazil) population-based cohort study of aging. Potential confounding variables included sociodemographic characteristics and an array of health measures. The prevalence of T. cruzi infection was 37.5% and 56.3% of those infected had a major ECG abnormality. Baseline T. cruzi infection was correlated with higher levels of African and Native American ancestry, which in turn were strongly associated with poor socioeconomic circumstances. Cardiomyopathy in infected persons was not significantly associated with African or Native American ancestry levels. Infected persons with a major ECG abnormality were at increased risk of 15-year mortality relative to their counterparts with no such abnormalities (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.80; 95% 1.41, 2.32). African and Native American ancestry levels had no significant effect modifying this association. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings indicate that African and Native American ancestry have no influence on the presence of major ECG abnormalities and had no influence on the ability of an ECG abnormality to predict mortality in older people infected with T. cruzi. In contrast, our results revealed a strong and independent association between prevalent T. cruzi infection and higher levels of African and Native American ancestry. Whether this association is a consequence of genetic background or differential exposure to infection remains to be determined. © 2016 Lima-Costa et al.

AB  - Oral transmission of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, has been documented in Latin American countries. The reported cases of infection were due to the ingestion of contaminated fresh fruit, juices, or sugar cane juice. There have been few studies on the physiopathology of the disease in oral transmission cases. Gastritis is a common ailment that can be caused by poor dietary habits, intake of alcohol or other gastric irritants, bacterial infection, or by the widespread use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This study investigated in a mouse model whether gastric mucosal injury, induced by aspirin, would affect the course of disease in animals infected with T. cruzi by the oral route. The CL14 and G strains of T. cruzi, both of low infectivity, were used. To this end, groups of BALB/c mice were treated during 5 days with aspirin (100 mg kg-1) before oral infection with T. cruzi metacyclic forms (4 × 105 or 5 × 107 parasites/mouse). Histological analysis and determination of nitric oxide and TNF-α were performed in gastric samples obtained 5 days after infection. Parasitemia was monitored from the thirteenth day after infection. The results indicate that aspirin treatment of mice injured their gastric mucosa and facilitated invasion by both CL14 and G strains of T. cruzi. Strain CL14 caused more severe infection compared to the G strain, as larger numbers of amastigote nests were found in the stomach and parasitemia levels were higher. Our study is novel in that it shows that gastric mucosal damage caused by aspirin, a commonly used NSAID, facilitates T. cruzi infection by the oral route. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Triatomines are hematophagous insects that act as vectors of Chagas disease. Rhodnius neglectus is one of these kissing bugs found, contributing to the transmission of this American trypanosomiasis. The saliva of hematophagous arthropods contains bioactive molecules responsible for counteracting host haemostatic, inflammatory, and immune responses. Methods/Principal Findings: Next generation sequencing and mass spectrometry-based protein identification were performed to investigate the content of triatomine R. neglectus saliva. We deposited 4,230 coding DNA sequences (CDS) in GenBank. A set of 636 CDS of proteins of putative secretory nature was extracted from the assembled reads, 73 of them confirmed by proteomic analysis. The sialome of R. neglectus was characterized and serine protease transcripts detected. The presence of ubiquitous protein families was revealed, including lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, and antigen-5. Metalloproteases, disintegrins, and odorant binding protein families were less abundant. Conclusions/Significance: The data presented improve our understanding of hematophagous arthropod sialomes, and aid in understanding hematophagy and the complex interplay among vectors and their vertebrate hosts.

AB  - Background. It is currently unclear why only a proportion of children born to Trypanosoma cruzi-infected mothers acquire the infection. We have examined the association of 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in genes coding for placental expression enzymes as genetic markers of susceptibility to congenital T. Cruzi infection (hereafter, "congenital infection"): rs2014683 and rs1048988 in ALPP; rs11244787 and rs1871054 in ADAM12; rs243866, rs243865, rs17859821, rs243864, and rs2285053 in MMP2; and rs3918242 and rs2234681 in MMP9. Methods. Two groups of children born to mothers seropositive for T. Cruzi were compared: 101 had congenital infection, and 116 were uninfected. Novel high-resolution melting and capillary electrophoresis genotyping techniques were designed and used. Results. Logistic regression analysis showed that mutations in rs11244787 and rs1871054 (in ADAM12) and rs243866, rs17859821, and rs2285053 (in MMP2) were associated with susceptibility to congenital infection. Multifactor dimensionality reduction revealed that genotyping results for rs11244787, rs1871054, rs243866, rs17859821 and rs243864 sites would be a good predictor of congenital infection. Conclusions. Our results suggest an important role of human polymorphisms in proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and the immune response during congenital infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the association between mutations in placentally expressed genes and susceptibility to congenital infection. © 2015 The Author 2015.

AB  - Chagas' disease carries high morbidity and mortality due to acute parasitemia or cardiac, digestive, cutaneous or neurologic chronic lesions. Latin American countries have the majority of infected or at risk people. Transplanted patients using immunosuppressive agents may develop severe and even fatal forms of the disease. The available treatment causes frequent severe side-effects. A 59 years-old woman with end stage renal disease and positive serology for Chagas` disease, but without any clinical manifestation of this pathology, underwent kidney transplantation from a cadaveric donor and displayed three months later a thigh panniculitis from which a biopsy unveiled amastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. The skin lesions disappeared following treatment with benzonidazole, but the drug was discontinued due to severe pancytopenia. Along with this, infection with E. faecalis and cytomegalovirus were treated with vancomicin and ganciclovir. The patient kept very well afterwards, with no new skin lesions and with good graft function. One year and three months after the transplant, she had an emergency surgery for an aortic dissecting aneurysm. Irreversible shock and death occurred in the immediate post-surgical period. It was not possible to establish or to rule out a relationship between the trypanosomiasis and the aortic lesions. Chagas` disease must be remembered in differential diagnosis of several clinical situations in transplant patients, mainly in endemic areas. The treatment can yeld good clinical response, but serious side-effects from the drugs may ensue. More effective and better tolerated options are in need for treatment or prophylaxis.

AB  - Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi. Once known as an endemic health problem of poor rural populations in Latin American countries, it has now spread worldwide. The parasite is transmitted by triatomine bugs, of which Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera, Reduviidae, Triatominae) is one of the vectors and a model organism. This species occurs mainly in Central and South American countries where the disease is endemic. Disease prevention focuses on vector control programs that, in general, rely intensely on insecticide use. However, the massive use of chemical insecticides can lead to resistance. One of the major mechanisms is known as metabolic resistance that is associated with an increase in the expression or activity of detoxification genes. Three of the enzyme families that are involved in this process - carboxylesterases (CCE), glutathione s-transferases (GST) and cytochrome P450s (CYP) - are analyzed in the R. prolixus genome. A similar set of detoxification genes to those of the Hemipteran Acyrthosiphon pisum but smaller than in most dipteran species was found in R. prolixus genome. All major CCE classes (43 genes found) are present but the pheromone/hormone processing class had fewer genes than usual. One main expansion was detected on the detoxification/dietary class. The phosphotriesterase family, recently associated with insecticide resistance, was also represented with one gene. One microsomal GST gene was found and the cytosolic GST gene count (14 genes) is extremely low when compared to the other hemipteran species with sequenced genomes. However, this is similar to Apis mellifera, a species known for its deficit in detoxification genes. In R. prolixus 88 CYP genes were found, with representatives in the four clans (CYP2, CYP3, CYP4 and mitochondrial) usually found in insects. R. prolixus seems to have smaller species-specific expansions of CYP genes than mosquitoes and beetles, among others. The number of R. prolixus CYP genes is similar to the hemipteran Ac. pisum, although with a bigger expansion in CYP3 and CYP4 clans, along with several gene fragments, mostly in CYP4 clan. Eleven founding members of new families were detected, consisting of ten genes in the CYP3 clan and 1 gene in the CYP4 clan. Members of these clans were proposed to have important detoxification roles in insects. The identification of CCE, GST and CYP genes is of utmost importance for directing detoxification studies on triatomines that can help insecticide management strategies in control programs. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Chagas disease and the leishmaniases are endemic zoonoses of great importance to public health in the state of Piauí, Brazil. The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) is a major reservoir, host of Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. in both urban and rural areas, playing an important role in the transmission of these parasites. The present study evaluated the prevalence of both infectious diseases in dogs of a rural area in the municipality of São João do Piauí, Piauí State. One hundred twenty-nine blood samples were collected for serological assessment: for the leishmaniases, 49 (38%) animals tested positive by the Dual-Path Platform technology (DPP), nine (6%) by the Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and 19 (14.7%) by the Indirect Fluorescent Antibody test (IFA); while for American Trypanosomiasis, 36 (28%) dogs were reagent by ELISA and 21 by IFA. Of the 129 dogs sampled, 76 were submitted to xenodiagnosis, bone marrow aspiration and skin biopsy to perform parasitological tests whose results showed only one (2.3%) positive skin sample for Trypanosoma caninum and one positive xenodiagnosis for T. cruzi, both results confirmed by molecular assays. Three hundred triatomines of the species Triatoma brasiliensis and 552 phlebotomines-509 (97%) of the species Lutzomyia longipalpis, were also captured. © 2016, Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo.

AB  - This paper describes the development of a label-free electrochemical immunosensor for the qualitative detection of American trypanosomiasis in serum samples. The immunosensor was constructed using self assembled monolayer technique with gold substrate modified with monolayer of 3-mercaptopropionic acid. The T. cruzi antigens were immobilized after activation carboxylic groups in monolayer with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide. The parameters that can interfere the impedimetric response of the immunosensor response such as, concentration and incubation time in the solution of T. cruzi antigens, concentration of bovine serum albumin and incubation time in the solution of T. cruzi antibodies were optimized in the presence of the probe molecule hexacyanoferrate(II)/(III), using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The interaction between antigen–antibody was monitored using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the results were expressed in terms of the increase of the charge transfer resistance across the interface. The immunosensor showed selective and sensitive in the qualitative detection of T. cruzi antibodies in serum samples infected with toxoplasma antibodies. Therefore, the proposed methodology is a promising alternative for the development of a immunosensor for serological qualitative diagnosis of Chagas disease. © 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

AB  - Background: Bat trypanosomes are implicated in the evolution of the T. cruzi clade, which harbours most African, European and American trypanosomes from bats and other trypanosomes from African, Australian and American terrestrial mammals, including T. cruzi and T. rangeli, the agents of the American human trypanosomiasis. The diversity of bat trypanosomes globally is still poorly understood, and the common ancestor, geographical origin, and evolution of species within the T. cruzi clade remain largely unresolved. Methods: Trypanosome sequences were obtained from cultured parasites and from museum archived liver/blood samples of bats captured from Guatemala (Central America) to the Brazilian Atlantic Coast. Phylogenies were inferred using Small Subunit (SSU) rRNA, glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH), and Spliced Leader (SL) RNA genes. Results: Here, we described Trypanosoma wauwau n. sp. from Pteronotus bats (Mormoopidae) placed in the T. cruzi clade, then supporting the bat-seeding hypothesis whereby the common ancestor of this clade likely was a bat trypanosome. T. wauwau was sister to the clade T. spp-Neobats from phyllostomid bats forming an assemblage of trypanosome species exclusively of Noctilionoidea Neotropical bats, which was sister to an Australian clade of trypanosomes from indigenous marsupials and rodents, which possibly evolved from a bat trypanosome. T. wauwau was found in 26.5 % of the Pteronotus bats examined, and phylogeographical analysis evidenced the wide geographical range of this species. To date, this species was not detected in other bats, including those that were sympatric or shared shelters with Pteronotus. T. wauwau did not develop within mammalian cells, and was not infective to Balb/c mice or to triatomine vectors of T. cruzi and T. rangeli. Conclusions: Trypanosoma wauwau n. sp. was linked to Pteronotus bats. The positioning of the clade T. wauwau/T.spp-Neobats as the most basal Neotropical bat trypanosomes and closely related to an Australian lineage of trypanosomes provides additional evidence that the T. cruzi clade trypanosomes likely evolved from bats, and were dispersed in bats within and between continents from ancient to unexpectedly recent times. © 2015 Lima et al.

AB  - Background: Self-rated health (SRH) has strong predictive value for mortality in different contexts and cultures, but there is inconsistent evidence on ethnoracial disparities in SRH in Latin America, possibly due to the complexity surrounding ethnoracial self-classification. Materials/Methods: We used 370,539 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to examine the association between individual genomic proportions of African, European and Native American ancestry, and ethnoracial self-classification, with baseline and 10-year SRH trajectories in 1,311 community dwelling older Brazilians. We also examined whether genomic ancestry and ethnoracial self-classification affect the predictive value of SRH for subsequent mortality. Results: European ancestry predominated among participants, followed by African and Native American (median = 84.0%, 9.6% and 5.3%, respectively); the prevalence of Non-White (Mixed and Black) was 39.8%. Persons at higher levels of African and Native American genomic ancestry, and those self-identified as Non-White, were more likely to report poor health than other groups, even after controlling for socioeconomic conditions and an array of self-reported and objective physical health measures. Increased risks for mortality associated with worse SRH trajectories were strong and remarkably similar (hazard ratio ∼3) across all genomic ancestry and ethno-racial groups. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated for the first time that higher levels of African and Native American genomic ancestry- and the inverse for European ancestry-were strongly correlated with worse SRH in a Latin American admixed population. Both genomic ancestry and ethnoracial self-classification did not modify the strong association between baseline SRH or SRH trajectory, and subsequent mortality. © 2015 Lima-Costa et al.

AB  - Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), caused by Paracoccidioides species, is the main cause of death due to systemic mycoses in Brazil and other Latin American countries. Therapeutic options for PCM and other systemic mycoses are limited and time-consuming, and there are high rates of noncompliance, relapses, toxic side effects, and sequelae. Previous work has shown that the cyclopalladated 7a compound is effective in treating several kinds of cancer and parasitic Chagas disease without significant toxicity in animals. Here we show that cyclopalladated 7a inhibited the in vitro growth of Paracoccidioides lutzii Pb01 and P. brasiliensis isolates Pb18 (highly virulent), Pb2, Pb3, and Pb4 (less virulent) in a dose-response manner. Pb18 was the most resistant. Opportunistic Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans were also sensitive. BALB/c mice showed significantly lighter lung fungal burdens when treated twice a day for 20 days with a low cyclopalladated 7a dose of 30 μg/ml/day for 30 days after intratracheal infection with Pb18. Electron microscopy images suggested that apoptosis- and autophagy-like mechanisms are involved in the fungal killing mechanism of cyclopalladated 7a. Pb18 yeast cells incubated with the 7a compound showed remarkable chromatin condensation, DNA degradation, superoxide anion production, and increased metacaspase activity suggestive of apoptosis. Autophagy-related killing mechanisms were suggested by increased autophagic vacuole numbers and acidification, as indicated by an increase in LysoTracker and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining in cyclopalladated 7a-treated Pb18 yeast cells. Considering that cyclopalladated 7a is highly tolerated in vivo and affects yeast fungal growth through general apoptosisand autophagy-like mechanisms, it is a novel promising drug for the treatment of PCM and other mycoses.

AB  - Human American trypanosomiasis, commonly called Chagas disease, is one of the most neglected illnesses in the world and remains one of the most prevalent chronic infectious diseases of Latin America with thousands of new cases every year. The only treatments available have been introduced five decades ago. They have serious, undesirable side effects and disputed benefits in the chronic stage of the disease - a characteristic and debilitating cardiomyopathy and/or megavisceras. Several laboratories have therefore focused their efforts in finding better drugs. Although recent years have brought new clinical trials, these are few and lack diversity in terms of drug mechanism of action, thus resulting in a weak drug discovery pipeline. This fragility has been recently exposed by the failure of two candidates; posaconazole and E1224, to sterilely cure patients in phase 2 clinical trials. Such setbacks highlight the need for continuous, novel and high quality drug discovery and development efforts to discover better and safer treatments. In this article we will review past and current findings on drug discovery for Trypanosoma cruzi made by academic research groups, industry and other research organizations over the last half century. We also analyze the current research landscape that is now better placed than ever to deliver alternative treatments for Chagas disease in the near future. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis represents an important public health issue in different parts of the world, requiring that measures be put in place to control the spread of the disease worldwide. The canine leishmaniasis diagnosis is not easy based on clinical signs, since dogs may not develop the infection with recognizable signs. Thus, the laboratorial diagnosis is essential to ascertain the incidence and prevalence of canine leishmaniasis especially in areas with major control efforts. Although, the diagnosis can be performed by the use of different approaches, the molecular methods such as PCR have become an indispensable tool for leishmaniases diagnosis. A TaqMan assay for real-time PCR (Linj31-qPCR) was developed to determine the parasite occurrence in clinical cases of leishmaniasis. The assay targets an L. (L.) infantum hypothetical protein region. The specificity of the assay was verified by using Leishmania World Health Organization reference strains including parasites belonging to subgenus L. (Leishmania), subgenus L. (Viannia), other Leishmania species and Trypanosoma cruzi. The sensitivity was verified by using isolates of L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) infantum. The usefulness of the assay for diagnosis was ascertained by testing 277 samples from dogs in regions endemic for visceral and/or cutaneous leishmaniasis and from regions in which leishmaniasis was not endemic in São Paulo State, Brazil. Diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) was determined on these animals by conventional PCR and three serological tests. The dog samples were divided into four groups. I, dogs with CVL (n = 101); II, dogs with other diseases and without CVL (n = 97); III, dogs with American cutaneous leishmaniasis (n = 7), and, IV, dogs without CVL (n = 72) from areas where leishmaniasis was not endemic as control group. Results indicated that Linj31-qPCR was able to identify parasites belonging to subgenus L. (Leishmania) with no cross-amplification with other parasite subgenera. The Linj31-qPCR detected Leishmania parasites DNA in 98% of samples from Group I. In conclusion this methodology can be used as routine diagnostic tools to detect parasites from subgenus Leishmania. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A woman had been followed since 1957 for acute phase Chagas disease. Parasitological and serological tests were positive, and treatment included benznidazole in 1974. Following treatment, parasitological test results were negative and conventional serology remained positive until 1994, with subsequent discordant results (1995-1997). The results became consistently negative since 1999. She had an indeterminate chronic form until 1974. Only two minor and transitory nonspecifi c alterations on electrocardiogram were noted, with the last nine records normal until June 2014. This case confi rms the possibility of curing chronic disease and suggests the benefi t of specifi c treatments for preventing long-term morbidity. © 2015, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

AB  - Oral transmission of Chagas disease has been documented in Latin American countries. Nevertheless, significant studies on the pathophysiology of this form of infection are largely lacking. The few studies investigating oral route infection disregard that inoculation in the oral cavity (Oral infection, OI) or by gavage (Gastrointestinal infection, GI) represent different infection routes, yet both show clear-cut parasitemia and heart parasitism during the acute infection. Herein, BALB/c mice were subjected to acute OI or GI infection using 5x104 culture-derived Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes. OI mice displayed higher parasitemia and mortality rates than their GI counterparts. Heart histopathology showed larger areas of infiltration in the GI mice, whereas liver lesions were more severe in the OI animals, accompanied by higher Alanine Transaminase and Aspartate Transaminase serum contents. A differential cytokine pattern was also observed because OI mice presented higher proinflammatory cytokine (IFN-γ, TNF) serum levels than GI animals. Real-time PCR confirmed a higher TNF, IFN-γ, as well as IL-10 expression in the cardiac tissue from the OI group compared with GI. Conversely, TGF-β and IL-17 serum levels were greater in the GI animals. Immunolabeling revealed macrophages as the main tissue source of TNF in infected mice. The high mortality rate observed in the OI mice paralleled the TNF serum rise, with its inhibition by an anti-TNF treatment. Moreover, differences in susceptibility between GI versus OI mice were more clearly related to the host response than to the effect of gastric pH on parasites, since infection in magnesium hydroxide-treated mice showed similar results. Overall, the present study provides conclusive evidence that the initial site of parasite entrance critically affects host immune response and disease outcome. In light of the occurrence of oral Chagas disease outbreaks, our results raise important implications in terms of the current view of the natural disease course and host-parasite relationship. © 2015 Barreto-de-Albuquerque et al.

AB  - Background DNA repair mechanisms are crucial for maintenance of the genome in all organisms, including parasites where successful infection is dependent both on genomic stability and sequence variation. MSH2 is an early acting, central component of the Mismatch Repair (MMR) pathway, which is responsible for the recognition and correction of base mismatches that occur during DNA replication and recombination. In addition, recent evidence suggests that MSH2 might also play an important, but poorly understood, role in responding to oxidative damage in both African and American trypanosomes. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate the involvement of MMR in the oxidative stress response, null mutants of MSH2 were generated in Trypanosoma brucei procyclic forms and in Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigote forms. Unexpectedly, the MSH2 null mutants showed increased resistance to H2O2 exposure when compared with wild type cells, a phenotype distinct from the previously observed increased sensitivity of T. brucei bloodstream forms MSH2 mutants. Complementation studies indicated that the increased oxidative resistance of procyclic T. brucei was due to adaptation to MSH2 loss. In both parasites, loss of MSH2 was shown to result in increased tolerance to alkylation by MNNG and increased accumulation of 8-oxo-guanine in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, indicating impaired MMR. In T. cruzi, loss of MSH2 also increases the parasite capacity to survive within host macrophages. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, these results indicate MSH2 displays conserved, dual roles in MMR and in the response to oxidative stress. Loss of the latter function results in life cycle dependent differences in phenotypic outcomes in T. brucei MSH2 mutants, most likely because of the greater burden of oxidative stress in the insect stage of the parasite. © 2015 Grazielle-Silva et al.

AB  - American trypanosomiasis is an emerging zoonosis in the Brazilian Amazon. Studies on benznidazole (BZ) chemotherapy with Trypanosoma cruzi from this region have great relevance, given the different discrete typing units (DTUs) that infect humans in the Amazon and other regions of Brazil. We performed a parasitological, histopathological, and molecular analysis of mice inoculated with strains of T. cruzi I, II, and IV that were BZ-treated during the acute phase of infection. Groups of Swiss mice were inoculated; 13 received oral BZ, whereas the other 13 comprised the untreated controls. Unlike parasitemia, the infectivity and mortality did not vary among the DTUs. Trypanosoma cruzi DNA was detected in all tissues analyzed and the proportion of organs parasitized varied with the parasite DTU. The BZ treatment reduced the most parasitological parameters, tissue parasitism and the inflammatory processes at all infection stages and for all DTUs. However, the number of significant reductions varied according to the DTU and infection phase.

AB  - Background: Several tests are performed to obtain better accuracy when diagnosing American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL). It is believed that antigens released via secretion, excretion and metabolism are more specific than are antigens released by the lysis of Leishmania parasites. Such antigens are known as exo-antigens (exo-Ag) and are formed from products released by cultured parasites in a way that is similar to that in which they cause infections in hosts. Objective: We attempted to validate a Leishmania mexicana ELISA exo-Ag for ATL diagnosis in Midwestern Brazil. Methods: A total of 281 patients were included in the study. We analysed pre-treatment blood from 98 ATL patients; out of those, 85.7% and 14.3% had cutaneous and mucosal forms, respectively. Results: The exo-Ag accuracy was 83.99% (95% CI. = 79.24-87.81) with a sensitivity value of 90.82% (95% CI. = 83.46-95.09) and an overall specificity value of 80.33% (95% CI. = 73.97-85.44). The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 71.20% (95% CI. = 62.72-78.41) and 94.23% (95% CI. = 89.40-96.94), respectively. Among healthy controls, exo-Ag had a specificity of 91.25% (95% CI. = 83.02-95.70); additionally, the test had specificity rates of 66.67% (95% CI. = 46.71-82.03) in Chagas disease patients, 60.61% (95% CI. = 43.68-75.32) in patients with rheumatic diseases, 76.92% (95% CI. = 49.74-91.82) in pemphigus foliaceus patients, 87.50% (95% CI. = 52.91-97.76) in leprosy patients, 87.50% (95% CI. = 63.98-96.50) in VRDL-positive patients, and 77.78 (95% CI. = 45.26-93.68) in deep mycosis patients. Conclusion: Based on the indicators of validity, we conclude that the results obtained in this study enable the recommendation of the exo-Ag ELISA for ATL diagnosis once it presented a reasonable accuracy compared to classical methods. Cost evaluations are necessary to completely define the role of this technique in large scale. © 2015 Elsevier Editora Ltda.

AB  - Aims To assess the results of transcatheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias in Latin America and establish the first Latin American transcatheter ablation registry. Methods and results All ablation procedures performed between 1 January and 31 December 2012 were analysed retrospectively. Data were obtained on the characteristics and resources of participating centres (public or private institution, number of beds, cardiac surgery availability, type of room for the procedures, days per week assigned to electrophysiology procedures, type of fluoroscopy equipment, availability and type of electroanatomical mapping system, intracardiac echo, cryoablation, and number of electrophysiologists) and the results of 17 different ablation substrates: atrio-ventricular node reentrant tachycardia, typical atrial flutter, atypical atrial flutter, left free wall accessory pathway, right free wall accessory pathway, septal accessory pathway, right-sided focal atrial tachycardia, left-sided focal atrial tachycardia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, atrio-ventricular node, premature ventricular complex, idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, post-myocardial infarction ventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, ventricular tachycardia in congenital heart disease, and ventricular tachycardias in other structural heart diseases. Data of 15 099 procedures were received from 120 centres in 13 participating countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Dominican Republic, Uruguay, and Venezuela). Accessory pathway was the group of arrhythmias most frequently ablated (31%), followed by atrio-ventricular node reentrant tachycardia (29%), typical atrial flutter (14%), and atrial fibrillation (11%). Overall success was 92% with the rate of global complications at 4% and mortality 0.05%. Conclusion Catheter ablation in Latin America can be considered effective and safe. © The Author 2015.

AB  - Background: Congenital transmission is a major source of new Trypanosoma cruzi infections, and as vector and blood bank control continue to improve, the proportion due to congenital infection will grow. A major unanswered question is why reported transmission rates from T. cruzi-infected mothers vary so widely among study populations. Women with high parasite loads during pregnancy are more likely to transmit to their infants, but the factors that govern maternal parasite load are largely unknown. Better understanding of these factors could enable prioritization of screening programs to target women most at risk of transmission to their infants. Methodology/Principal Findings: We screened pregnant women presenting for delivery in a large urban hospital in Bolivia and followed infants of infected women for congenital Chagas disease. Of 596 women screened, 128 (21.5%) had confirmed T. cruzi infection; transmission occurred from 15 (11.7%) infected women to their infants. Parasite loads were significantly higher among women who transmitted compared to those who did not. Congenital transmission occurred from 31.3% (9/29), 15.4% (4/26) and 0% (0/62) of women with high, moderate and low parasite load, respectively (χx2 for trend 18.2; p<0.0001). Twin births were associated with higher transmission risk and higher maternal parasite loads. Infected women without reported vector exposure had significantly higher parasite loads than those who had lived in an infested house (median 26.4 vs 0 parasites/mL; p<0.001) with an inverse relationship between years of living in an infested house and parasite load. Conclusions/Significance: We hypothesize that sustained vector-borne parasite exposure and repeated superinfection by T. cruzi may act as an immune booster, allowing women to maintain effective control of the parasite despite the down-regulation of late pregnancy. © 2015 Rendell et al.

AB  - Background: Galectin-3, a β-galactoside binding lectin, has been described as a mediator of cardiac fibrosis in experimental studies and as a risk factor associated with cardiovascular events in subjects with heart failure. Previous studies have evaluated the genetic susceptibility to Chagas disease in humans, including the polymorphisms of cytokine genes, demonstrating correlations between the genetic polymorphism and cardiomyopathy development in the chronic phase. However, the relationship between the galectin-3 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and phenotypic variations in Chagas disease has not been evaluated. Objective: The present study aimed to determine whether genetic polymorphisms of galectin-3 may predispose to the development of cardiac forms of Chagas disease. Methods: Fifty-five subjects with Chagas disease were enrolled in this observational study. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for genotyping the variants rs4644 and rs4652 of the galectin-3 gene. Results: For the SNP rs4644, the relative risk for the cardiac form was not associated with the genotypes AA (OR = 0.79, p = 0.759), AC (OR = 4.38, p = 0.058), or CC (OR = 0.39, p = 0.127). Similarly, for the SNP rs4652, no association was found between the genotypes AA (OR = 0.64, p = 0.571), AC (OR = 2.85, p = 0.105), or CC (OR = 0.49, p = 0.227) and the cardiac form of the disease. Conclusion: Our results showed no association between the different genotypes for both SNPs of the galectin-3 gene and the cardiac form of Chagas disease. © 2015 Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

AB  - American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) is a major, clinically relevant zoonosis in Brazil. The disease spectrum includes single, localized, cutaneous ulcers, diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis and mucosal disease. A subclinical form of the disease has also been described in individuals living in ACL-endemic regions. The goal of this study was to employ immunological and molecular diagnostic methods to evaluate the presence of subclinical ACL in healthy individuals from an ACL-endemic region in northwestern Paraná. Antibodies IgG were detected by enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and the positive samples were analyzed by indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) for Leishmania braziliensis and Trypanosoma cruzi. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), employing the MP3H/MP1L primers, amplified a fragment of Leishmania (Viannia) k-DNA. Of the 159 individuals analyzed, 31 presented ELISA-positive serology and 5 and 8 of these were IIF-positive for Leishmania and T. cruzi, respectively. All 159 individuals were PCR-negative. Most ELISA-positive individuals were males and the cities São Jorge do Ivaí and Doutor Camargo showed the highest prevalence of positive individuals. Our results reveal the presence of subclinical Leishmania infections in inhabitants of this region. Further investigation of this population may contribute to understanding the immune responses to ACL. © 2015 Rejane Cristina Ribas-Silva, Taisa Rocha Navasconi, Laís de SouzaBraga, Elen Paula Leatte, Cissiara Maneti Skraba, Carolina Cela Conter, Sueli D.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is a parasitic infection that originated in the Americas and is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. In the last few years, the disease has spread to countries in North America, Asia and Europe due to the migration of Latin Americans. In the Brazilian Amazon, CD has an endemic transmission, especially in the Rio Negro region, where an occupational hazard was described for piaçaveiros (piassaba gatherers). In the State of Amazonas, the fi rst chagasic infection was reported in 1977, and the fi rst acute CD case was recorded in 1980. After initiatives to integrate acute CD diagnostics with the malaria laboratories network, reports of acute CD cases have increased. Most of these cases are associated with oral transmission by the consumption of contaminated food. Chronic cases have also been diagnosed, mostly in the indeterminate form. These cases were detected by serological surveys in cardiologic outpatient clinics and during blood donor screening. Considering that the control mechanisms adopted in Brazil’s classic transmission areas are not fully applicable in the Amazon, it is important to understand the disease behavior in this region, both in the acute and chronic cases. Therefore, the pursuit of control measures for the Amazon region should be a priority given that CD represents a challenge to preserving the way of life of the Amazon’s inhabitants. © 2015, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

AB  - Transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi during pregnancy is estimated to occur in less than 20% of infected mothers; however, the etiopathogenesis is not completely understood. The Centre for Studies on Chagas Disease provides confirmation of T. cruzi infection for individuals living in central Brazil. In this retrospective hospital-based study, all requests for diagnosis of T. cruzi infection in individuals less than 21 years old from 1994-2014 were searched. We end with 1,211 individuals and their respective infected mothers. Congenital transmission of infection was confirmed in 24 individuals (2%) in central Brazil, an area where the main T. cruzi lineage circulating in humans is TcII. This low prevalence of congenital Chagas disease is discussed in relation to recent findings in the south region of Brazil, where TcV is the main lineage and congenital transmission has a higher prevalence (approximately 5%), similar to frequencies reported in Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. This is the first report to show geographical differences in the rates of congenital transmission of T. cruzi and the relationship between the prevalence of congenital transmission and the type of Tc prevalent in each region. © 2015, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

AB  - Congenital infection with Trypanosoma cruzi is a global problem, occurring on average in 5% of children born from chronically infected mothers in endemic areas, with variations depending on the region. This presentation aims to focus on and update epidemiological data, research methods, involved factors, control strategy and possible prevention of congenital infection with T. cruzi. Considering that etiological treatment of the child is always effective if performed before one year of age, the diagnosis of infection in pregnant women and their newborns has to become the standard of care and integrated into the surveillance programs of syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus. In addition to the standard tests, polymerase chain reaction performed on blood of neonates of infected mothers one month after birth might improve the diagnosis of congenital infection. Recent data bring out that its transmission can be prevented through treatment of infected women before they become pregnant. The role of parasite genotypes and host genetic factors in parasite transmission and development of infection in foetuses/neonates has to be more investigated in order to better estimate the risk factors and impact on health of congenital infection with T. cruzi. © 2015, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

AB  - This review deals with transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi by the most important domestic vectors, blood transfusion and oral intake. Among the vectors, Triatoma infestans, Panstrongylus megistus, Rhodnius prolixus, Triatoma dimidiata, Triatoma brasiliensis, Triatoma pseudomaculata, Triatoma sordida, Triatoma maculata, Panstrongylus geniculatus, Rhodnius ecuadoriensis and Rhodnius pallescens can be highlighted. Transmission of Chagas infection, which has been brought under control in some countries in South and Central America, remains a great challenge, particularly considering that many endemic countries do not have control over blood donors. Even more concerning is the case of non-endemic countries that receive thousands of migrants from endemic areas that carry Chagas disease, such as the United States of America, in North America, Spain, in Europe, Japan, in Asia, and Australia, in Oceania. In the Brazilian Amazon Region, since Shaw et al. (1969) described the first acute cases of the disease caused by oral transmission, hundreds of acute cases of the disease due to oral transmission have been described in that region, which is today considered to be endemic for oral transmission. Several other outbreaks of acute Chagas disease by oral transmission have been described in different states of Brazil and in other South American countries. © 2015, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

AB  - In this paper we discuss the main aspects of drugs targeting 14 -demethylase (CYP51) an enzyme belonging to the superfamily of cytochrome P450. Different isoforms of CYP51 are present in all living organisms, since the products of its metabolic pathway, such as steroids, are of fundamental importance in the homeostasis while maintaining the integrity, fluidity and permeability of the cell membranes. In man, the main steroid in the cell membrane is cholesterol, unlike what occurs in fungi and some protozoa, which instead have ergosterol. Apart from infections caused by fungus, whose impact on public health has grown markedly, we highlight the hemoflagellated protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease (CD), or American trypanosomiasis. The progress achieved in recent decades in understanding the mechanism of action of antifungal azoles in clinical use as well as the knowledge about the structural differences between the isoforms of CYP51present in fungi and trypanosomatides allowed the design and synthesis of new molecules that are currently under clinical development for the treatment of CD. The drugs that act inhibiting the CYP51 may also bind to other oxidases such as aromatases responsible for the synthesis of hormones, as well as other cytochromes involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics. The toxic effects of new CYP51 inhibitors should be studied, in order to make possible the evaluation of the cost-effective use of molecules that act by this mechanism of action and that may become drugs for the treatment of infections caused by fungi and protozoa.

AB  - Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma cruzi) is one of the most important neglected tropical diseases in the Western Hemisphere. The toxicities and limited efficacies of current antitrypanosomal drugs have prompted a search for alternative technologies such as a therapeutic vaccine comprised of T. cruzi antigens, including a recombinant antigen encoding the N-terminal 65 kDa portion of Trypomastigote surface antigen-1 (TSA-1). With at least six known genetically distinct T. cruzi lineages, variability between the different lineages poses a unique challenge for the development of broadly effective therapeutic vaccine. The variability across the major lineages in the current vaccine candidate antigen TSA-1 has not previously been addressed. To assess the variation in TSA-1, we cloned and sequenced TSA-1 from several different T. cruzi strains representing three of the most clinically relevant lineages. Analysis of the different alleles showed limited variation in TSA-1 across the different strains and fit with the current theory for the evolution of the different lineages. Additionally, minimal variation in known antigenic epitopes for the HLA-A 02 allele suggests that interlineage variation in TSA-1 would not impair the range and efficacy of a vaccine containing TSA-1. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: Heart disease progression occurs in 30% of patients with chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Supplementation with selenium (Se) in animal model of T. cruzi infection produced promising results. There is evidence that patients with Chagas heart disease have lower Se levels than healthy individuals and patients with T. cruzi infection without of cardiac disease. The aim of this investigation is to estimate the effect of Se treatment on prevention of heart disease progression in patients with chagasic cardiopathy.Methods: The Selenium Treatment and Chagasic Cardiopathy trial is a superiority, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. The eligibility criteria are as follows: (1) a Chagas disease diagnosis confirmed by serology; (2) segmental, mild or moderate global left ventricular systolic dysfunction; and (3) age between 18 and 65 years. The exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) pregnancy, (2) diabetes mellitus, (3) tobacco use, (4) alcohol abuse, (5) evidence of nonchagasic heart disease, (6) depression, (7) dysphagia with evidence of food residues in the esophagus, (8) dysphagia with weight loss higher than 15% of usual weight in the last four months and/or (9) conditions that may result in low protocol adherence. The intervention will be 100 μg of sodium selenite once daily for 365 consecutive days compared to placebo. The following are the primary outcomes to be measured: (1) the trajectories of the left ventricular ejection fraction in the follow-up period; (2) reduction of heart disease progression rates, with progression defined as a 10% decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction; and (3) rate of hospital admissions attributable to dysrhythmia, heart failure or stroke due to Chagas disease. One hundred thirty patients will be randomly allocated into either the intervention or placebo group at a ratio of 1:1. The sequence allocation concealment and blinding were planned to be conducted with the strategy of numbered boxes. Both patients and health-care providers will remain blinded to the intervention groups during the 5 years of follow-up.Discussion: If Se treatment reduces the progression of Chagas cardiopathy, the inclusion of this micronutrient in the daily diet can improve the therapeutic regimen for this neglected tropical disease at low cost.Trial registration: Clinical Trials.gov ID: NCT00875173 (registered 20 October 20 2008). © 2014 Alvarenga Americano do Brasil et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Chagas disease is a neglected infectious illness, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. It remains a challenging health issue in Latin America, where it is endemic, and so far there is no immunoprophylatic vaccine or satisfactory chemotherapic treatment for its chronic stage. The present work addressed the analysis of the plasma membrane (PM) subproteome from T. cruzi human-hosted life stages, trypomastigote and axenic amastigote, by two complementary PM protein enrichment techniques followed by identification using an LC-MS/MS approach. The results revealed an extensive repertoire of proteins in the PM subproteomes, including enzymes that might be suitable candidates for drug intervention. The comparison of the cell surface proteome among the life forms revealed some potentially stage-specific enzymes, although the majority was shared by both stages. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the vast majority of the identified proteins are membrane-derived and/or possess predicted transmembrane domains. They are mainly involved in host cell infection, protein adhesion, cell signaling, and the modulation of mammalian host immune response. Several virulence factors and proteins potentially capable of acting at a number of metabolic pathways of the host and also to regulate cell differentiation of the parasite itself were also found. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Introduction. New therapeutic options are necessary for patients with chronic Chagas disease, a leading cause of heart failure in Latin American countries. Stem cell therapy focused on improving cardiac function is a promising approach for treating heart disease. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of cardiac mesenchymal stem cells (CMSCs) in a mouse model of chronic Chagas disease. Methods. CMSCs were isolated from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic C57BL/6 mouse hearts and tested for adipogenic, osteogenic, chondrogenic, endothelial, and cardiogenic differentiation potentials evaluated by histochemical and immunofluorescence techniques. A lymphoproliferation assay was performed to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of CMSCs. To investigate the therapeutic potential of CMSCs, C57BL/6 mice chronically infected with Trypanosoma cruzi were treated with 10 6 CMSCs or saline (control) by echocardiography-guided injection into the left ventricle wall. All animals were submitted to cardiac histopathological and immunofluorescence analysis in heart sections from chagasic mice. Analysis by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed in the heart to evaluate the expression of cytokines involved in the inflammatory response. Results: CMSCs demonstrated adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation potentials. Moreover, these cells expressed endothelial cell and cardiomyocyte features upon defined stimulation culture conditions and displayed immunosuppressive activity in vitro. After intramyocardial injection, GFP + CMSCs were observed in heart sections of chagasic mice one week later; however, no observed GFP+ cells co-expressed troponin T or connexin-43. Histopathological analysis revealed that CMSC-treated mice had a significantly decreased number of inflammatory cells, but no reduction in fibrotic area, two months after treatment. Analysis by qRT-PCR demonstrated that cell therapy significantly decreased tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression and increased transforming growth factor-beta in heart samples. Conclusions: We conclude that the CMSCs exert a protective effect in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy primarily through immunomodulation. © 2014 Silva et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The nonpolar fraction of an aqueous ethanol extract of the roots of Arrabidaea brachypoda, a Brazilian medicinal plant, demonstrated significant in vitro activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease. Targeted isolation of the active constituents led to the isolation of three new dimeric flavonoids (1-3), and their structures were elucidated using UV, NMR, and HRMS analysis, as well as by chemical derivatization. The anti-T. cruzi activity and cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells were determined for these substances. Compound 1 exhibited no activity toward T. cruzi, while flavonoids 2 and 3 exhibited selective activity against these trypomastigotes. Compounds 2 and 3 inhibited the parasite invasion process and its intracellular development in host cells with similar potencies to benznidazole. In addition, compound 2 reduced the blood parasitemia of T. cruzi-infected mice. This study has revealed that these two dimeric flavonoids represent potential anti-T. cruzi lead compounds for further drug development. © 2014 The American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.

AB  - Electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and theoretical studies of the reduction reactions in nor-β-lapachone derivatives including a nitro redox center showed that reduction of the compounds involves the formation of several radical intermediates, including a biradical dianion resultant from the separate reduction of the quinone and nitro groups in the molecules. Theoretical descriptions of the corresponding Fukui functions f αα+ and fββ +(r) and LUMO densities considering finite differences and frozen core approximations for describing the changes in electron and spin densities of the system allowed us to confirm these results. A description of the potential relationship with the obtained results and biological activity selectivity indexes suggests that both the formation of stable biradical dianion species and the stability of the semiquinone intermediates during further reduction are determining factors in the description of their biological activity. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - In this work, perturbed angular correlation (PAC) spectroscopy is used to study differences in the nuclear quadrupole interactions of Cd probes in DNA molecules of mice infected with the Y-strain of Trypanosoma cruzi. The possibility of investigating the local genetic alterations in DNA, which occur along generations of mice infected with T. cruzi, using hyperfine interactions obtained from PAC measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations in DNA bases is discussed. A comparison of DFT calculations with PAC measurements could determine the type of Cd coordination in the studied molecules. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use DFT calculations and PAC measurements to investigate the local environment of Cd ions bound to DNA bases in mice infected with Chagas disease. The obtained results also allowed the detection of local changes occurring in the DNA molecules of different generations of mice infected with T. cruzi, opening the possibility of using this technique as a complementary tool in the characterization of complicated biological systems. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, was described thousands of years ago. Currently, it affects millions of people, mostly in Latin America, and there are not suitable drugs for treating it. As an attempt to find appropriate drugs to deal with this problem, we report here on the design, synthesis, and characterization of 82 new compounds. Trypanosomicidal behavior in vitro showed more than 20 outstanding derivatives with anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activity. Furthermore, we studied the nonspecific toxicity against mammalian cells determining their selectivity and also performed mutagenicity studies. Proof of concept, in vivo studies, was conducted with two of the most promising derivatives (77 and 80). They were identified as candidates because they have (i) very simple and cost-effective syntheses; (ii) activity against different stages and strains of the parasite showing excellent in vivo behavior during the acute phase of Chagas disease; and (iii) neither nonspecific toxicity nor mutagenic activity. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Sterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51) is an important therapeutic target for fungal and parasitic infections due to its key role in the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of the cell membranes of these pathogenic organisms. We report the development of potent and selective d-tryptophan-derived inhibitors of T. cruzi CYP51. Structural information obtained from the cocrystal structure of CYP51 and (R)-2, which is >1000-fold more potent than its enantiomer (S)-1, was used to guide design of additional analogues. The in vitro efficacy data presented here for (R)-2-(R)-8, together with preliminary in vitro pharmacokinetic data suggest that this new CYP51 inhibitor scaffold series has potential to deliver drug candidates for treatment of T. cruzi infections. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The development of cruzain inhibitors has been driven by the urgent need to develop novel and more effective drugs for the treatment of Chagas' disease. Herein, we report the lead optimization of a class of noncovalent cruzain inhibitors, starting from an inhibitor previously cocrystallized with the enzyme (Ki = 0.8 μM). With the goal of achieving a better understanding of the structure-activity relationships, we have synthesized and evaluated a series of over 40 analogues, leading to the development of a very promising competitive inhibitor (8r, IC50 = 200 nM, Ki = 82 nM). Investigation of the in vitro trypanocidal activity and preliminary cytotoxicity revealed the potential of the most potent cruzain inhibitors in guiding further medicinal chemistry efforts to develop drug candidates for Chagas' disease. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - We investigated whether ELISA using crude antigens from insect and plant trypanosomatids, which are non-pathogenic and easily cultivated in large scale, has the same positivity data as Leishmania (Leishmania) chagasi, the etiological agent of human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or canine leishmaniasis (CanL), or as Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease (CD). The antigens from Crithidia fasciculata, Crithidia luciliae, and Leptomonas seymouri showed 100% cross-reactivity with VL and CanL samples, with no statistically titers differences from L. (L.) chagasi, however, 34% (17/50) of VL samples revealed higher titers using the insect trypanosomatids than the homologous antigen. On the other hand, antigens from Strigomonas culicis, Angomonas deanei, and Phytomonas serpens showed low cross-reactivity with VL and CanL samples. The sera from patients with American tegumentary leishmaniasis showed low levels of cross-reactivity with all trypanosomatids investigated, even with L. (L) chagasi, without titers dissimilarity among them. These parasites were also worthless as antigen source for detection of CD cases, which required homologous antigens to reach 100% positivity. This study showed, by ELISA, that crude extract of Crithidia and Leptomonas have epitopes similar to L. (L.) chagasi, which supports the idea of using them as antigens source for the serodiagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis. © 2013.

AB  - Today, there are approximately 8 million cases of Chagas disease in the southern cone of South America alone, and about 100 million people are living with the risk of becoming infected. The present pharmacotherapy is sometimes ineffective and has serious side effects. Here, we report a series of 4,5-dihydroisoxazoles incorporating hydroxamate moieties, which act as effective inhibitors of the carbonic anhydrase (CA) from Trypanosoma cruzi (TcCA). One compound (5g) was evaluated in detail and shows promising features as an antitrypanosomal agent. Excellent values for the inhibition of growth for all three developmental forms of the parasite were observed at low concentrations of 5g (IC50 values from 7.0 to &lt;1 μM). The compound has a selectivity index (SI) of 6.7 and no cytotoxicity to macrophage cells. Preliminary in vivo data showed that 5g reduces bloodstream parasites and that all treated mice survived; it was also more effective than the standard drug benznidazole. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi trans-sialidase (TcTS) is a key target protein for Chagas disease chemotherapy. In this study, we investigated the implications of active site flexibility on the biochemical mechanism of TcTS. Molecular dynamics studies revealed remarkable plasticity in the TcTS catalytic site, demonstrating, for the first time, how donor substrate engagement with the enzyme induces an acceptor binding site in the catalytic pocket that was not previously captured in crystal structures. Furthermore, NMR data showed cooperative binding between donor and acceptor substrates, supporting theoretical results. In summary, our data put forward a coherent dynamic framework to understand how a glycosidase evolved its highly efficient trans-glycosidase activity. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DNA barcoding assumes that a biological entity is completely separated from its closest relatives by a barcoding gap, which means that intraspecific genetic distance (from COI sequences) should never be greater than interspecific distances. We investigated the applicability of this strategy in identifying species of the genus Triatoma from South America.
FINDINGS: We calculated intra and interspecific Kimura-2-parameter distances between species from the infestans, matogrossensis, sordida and rubrovaria subcomplexes. In every subcomplex examined we observed at least one intraspecific distance greater than interspecific distances.
CONCLUSIONS: Although DNA barcoding is a straightforward approach, it was not applicable for identifying Southern American Triatoma species, which may have diverged recently. Thus, caution should be taken in identifying vector species using this approach, especially in groups where accurate identification of taxa is fundamentally linked to public health issues.

AB  - Bioactivity-guided fractionation of the MeOH extract from the leaves of Alchornea glandulosa afforded a new guanidine alkaloid named alchornedine, as well as two other inactive derivatives (pteroginine and pteroginidine). The structure of alchornedine, which shows a very rare ring system, was elucidated based on NMR, IR, and MS spectral analyses. This compound displayed antiprotozoal activity against Trypanosoma cruzi (Y strain). By using the MTT assay, the trypomastigotes showed an IC50 value of 93-μg/mL (443-μM), a similar effectiveness to the standard drug benznidazole. Alchornedine also showed activity against the intracellular amastigotes, with an IC50 value of 27-μg/mL (129-μM). Using benznidazole as a standard drug, this guanidine alkaloid was approximately 3-fold more effective against the intracellular form of T. cruzi. The mammalian cytotoxicity of alchornedine was verified against NCTC cells and demonstrated an IC50 of 50-μg/mL (237-μM), but this compound demonstrated a selective elimination of parasites inside macrophages without affecting the morphology of the host cells. Alchornedine was effective against both clinical forms of T. cruzi and could be used as a scaffold for future drug design studies against American trypanosomiasis. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

AB  - Introduction: Biological collections are depositories of information on different species and contribute to the knowledge, protection, conservation and maintenance of biodiversity. Methods: A list of triatomine species currently included in the Collection of Chagas Disease Vectors (FIOCRUZ-COLVEC) was prepared from the database made available by the Reference Center on Environmental Information. Results: COLVEC curatorship houses 4,778 specimens of triatomines, of which 811 come from other American countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, the United States of America, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela) and 3,967 are autochthonous from Brazil. Altogether, 56 species of Chagas disease vectors are represented in the COLVEC: two species of the Tribe Cavernicolini Usinger, 1944; fi fteen species of the tribe Rhodniini Pinto, 1926, of which 12 are of the genus Rhodnius and 3 are of the genus Psamolestes; and 39 species of the tribe Triatomini Jeannel, 1919, represented by the genus Dipetalogaster, two species of the genus Eratyrus, two of the genus Meccus, seven of the genus Panstrongylus and 27 of the genus Triatoma. Conclusions: This list provides important data on the diversity of triatomines currently included in COLVEC, including the expanded area of Panstrongylus lutzi occurrence in the municipalities Pirapora and Januária, State of Minas Gerais. The maintenance and expansion of the collection ensures the preservation of biodiversity and further studies. © 2014, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical. All Rights Reserved.

CYP51 inhibitors have been developed to treat infections caused by fungi, and more recently the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. To specifically optimize drug candidates for T. cruzi CYP51 (TcCYP51), we explored the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of a N-indolyl-oxopyridinyl-4- aminopropanyl-based scaffold originally identified in a target-based screen. This scaffold evolved via medicinal chemistry to yield orally bioavailable leads with potent anti-T. cruzi activity in vivo. Using an animal model of infection with a transgenic T. cruzi Y luc strain expressing firefly luciferase, we prioritized the biaryl and N-arylpiperazine analogues by oral bioavailability and potency. The drug-target complexes for both scaffold variants were characterized by X-ray structure analysis. Optimization of both binding mode and pharmacokinetic properties of these compounds led to potent inhibitors against experimental T. cruzi infection. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study was designed to verify the in vivo efficacy of sulfoxide and sulfone fexinidazole metabolites following oral administration in a murine model of Chagas disease. Female Swiss mice infected with the Y strain of Trypanosoma cruzi were treated orally once per day with each metabolite at doses of 10 to 100 mg/kg of body weight for a period of 20 days. Parasitemia was monitored throughout, and cures were detected by parasitological and PCR assays. The results were compared with those achieved with benznidazole treatment at the same doses. Fexinidazole metabolites were effective in reducing the numbers of circulating parasites and protecting mice against death, compared with untreated mice, but without providing cures at daily doses of 10 and 25 mg/kg. Both metabolites were effective in curing mice at 50 mg/kg/day (30% to 40%) and 100 mg/kg/day (100%). In the benznidazoletreated group, parasitological cure was detected only in animals treated with the higher dose of 100 mg/kg/day (80%). Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for each metabolite were obtained from a parallel group of uninfected mice and were used to estimate the profiles following repeated doses. Pharmacokinetic data suggested that biological efficacy most likely resides with the sulfone metabolite (or subsequent reactive metabolites formed following reduction of the nitro group) following administration of either the sulfoxide or the sulfone and that prolonged plasma exposure over the 24-h dosing window is required to achieve high cure rates. Fexinidazole metabolites were effective in treating T. cruzi in a mouse model of acute infection, with cure rates superior to those achieved with either fexinidazole itself or benznidazole.

AB  - This report describes the case of a patient with acute Chagas disease in Tocantins, Brazil, who was unaware of her pregnancy during benznidazole treatment. She presented with impaired cardiac function during the acute phase (pericarditis and incomplete right bundle-branch block) that resolved favorably after benznidazole therapy. Serological results also became negative, as determined by hemagglutination assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and immunofl uorescence assays. The child was born without sequelae and showed no evidence of congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection at birth or 24 days later.

AB  - Gold standard serological diagnostic methods focus on antigens that elicit a strong humoral immune response that is specific to a certain pathogen. In this study, we used bioinformatics approaches to identify linear B-cell epitopes that are conserved among Leishmania species but are divergent from the host species Homo sapiens and Canis familiaris and from Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, to select potential targets for the immunodiagnosis of leishmaniasis. Using these criteria, we selected heat shock protein 83.1 of Leishmania braziliensis for this study. We predicted three linear B-cell epitopes in its sequence. These peptides and the recombinant heat shock protein 83.1 (rHSP83.1) were tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) against serum samples from patients with tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and from dogs infected with Leishmania infantum (canine VL [CVL]). Our data show that rHSP83.1 is a promising target in the diagnosis of TL. We also identified specific epitopes derived from HSP83.1 that can be used in the diagnosis of human TL (peptide 3), both human and canine VL (peptides 1 and 3), and all TL, VL, and CVL clinical manifestations (peptide 3). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed the superior performance of rHSP83.1 and peptides 1 and 3 compared to that of the soluble L. braziliensis antigen and the reference test kit for the diagnosis of CVL in Brazil (EIE-LVC kit; Bio-Manguinhos, Fiocruz). Our study thus provides proof-of-principle evidence of the feasibility of using bioinformatics to identify novel targets for the immunodiagnosis of parasitic diseases using proteins that are highly conserved throughout evolution.

AB  - Chagas disease is one of the main public health issues in Latin America. Increasingly during the past few decades, Trypanosoma cruzi infection has been detected in North America, Europe, and the Western Pacific, mainly as a result of population movement. The limited availability of rapid serological diagnostic tests hinders rapid diagnosis and early treatment in areas of endemicity and nonendemicity. In collaboration with 11 national reference laboratories (NRLs) from different geographical areas, we evaluated the performances of commercialized serological rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for T. cruzi infection. Eleven commercialized T. cruzi infection RDTs were evaluated on a total of 474 samples extensively tested with at least three different techniques for Chagas disease, maintained at controlled low temperatures, and stored in the serum banks of the 11 NRLs. We measured the sensitivity, specificity, and concordance of each RDT and provided an additional questionnaire to evaluate its ease of use. The selected RDTs in this study were performed under controlled laboratory conditions. Out of the 11 RDTs, we found 8 of them to be useful, with the cassette format favored over the strip. We did not observe significant differences in RDT performances in the different regions. Overall, the performance results were lower than those disclosed by the manufacturers. The results of this evaluation validate the possibility of using RDTs to diagnose Chagas disease, thereby decreasing the time to treatment at a primary health care facility for patients who are willing to be treated. Further studies should be conducted in the laboratory and in the field to confirm these data, expressly to evaluate reproducibility in resource-limited settings, or using whole blood in clinical settings in areas of endemicity and nonendemicity.

AB  - The phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal heptapeptide repeats of the largest subunit ofRNApolymerase II (Pol II) controls several transcription-related events in eukaryotes. Trypanosomatids lack these typical repeats and display an unusual transcription control. RNAPol II associates with the transcription site of the spliced leader (SL) RNA, which is used in the trans-splicing of all mRNAs transcribed on long polycistronic units. We found that Trypanosoma cruzi RNA Pol II associated with chromatin is highly phosphorylated. When transcription is inhibited by actinomycin D, the enzyme runs off from SL genes, remaining hyperphosphorylated and associated with polycistronic transcription units. Upon heat shock, the enzyme is dephosphorylated and remains associated with the chromatin. Transcription is partially inhibited with the accumulation of housekeeping precursor mRNAs, except for heat shock genes. DNA damage caused dephosphorylation and transcription arrest, with RNA Pol II dissociating from chromatin although staying at the SL. In the presence of calyculin A, the hyperphosphorylated form detached from chromatin, including the SL loci. These results indicate that in trypanosomes, the unusual RNA Pol II is phosphorylated during the transcription of SL and polycistronic operons. Different types of stresses modify its phosphorylation state, affecting pre-RNA processing. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women and the risk of congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in Brazil, through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We searched electronic databases, grey literature and reference lists of included publications to identify epidemiological studies on the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women and on the congenital transmission rate of T. cruzi infection in Brazil published between January 1980 and June 2013. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using fixed- and random-effects models. Results: Sixteen articles were included - 12 studies on the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women (549 359 pregnant women) and nine on congenital transmission rates (1687 children born to infected mothers). Prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women ranged from 0.1% to 8.5%, and congenital transmission rates from 0% to 5.2%. The pooled prevalence of Chagas disease among pregnant women across studies was 1.1% (95% CI: 0.6-2.0); the pooled congenital transmission rate was 1.7% (95% CI: 0.9-3.1). In 2010, 34 629 pregnant women were estimated to be infected with T. cruzi, and 312-1073 children born (mean: 589 cases) with congenital infection. Conclusion: Congenital Chagas disease is a neglected public health problem in Brazil. Systematic congenital Chagas disease control programs through routine prenatal screening for T. cruzi should be widely implemented in Brazil's endemic areas, to identify infected pregnant women and newborns at risk of congenital infection. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Fifteen novel arylimidamides (AIAs) (6 bis-amidino and 9 mono-amidino analogues) were assayed against Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro and in vivo. All the bis-AIAs were more effective than the mono-AIAs, and two analogues, DB1967 and DB1989, were further evaluated in vivo. Although both of them reduced parasitemia, protection against mortality was not achieved. Our results show that the number of amidino-terminal units affects the efficacy of arylimidamides against T. cruzi. Copyright © 2014, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD), a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, remains a serious public health problem in several Latin American countries. The available chemotherapies for CD have limited efficacy and exhibit undesirable side effects. Aromatic diamidines and arylimidamides (AIAs) have shown broad-spectrum activity against intracellular parasites, including T. cruzi. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the biological activity of eight novel AIAs (16DAP002, 16SAB079, 18SAB075, 23SMB022, 23SMB026, 23SMB054, 26SMB070, and 27SMB009) against experimental models of T. cruzi infection in vitro and in vivo. Our data show that none of the compounds induced a loss of cellular viability up to 32 μM. Two AIAs, 18SAB075 and 16DAP002, exhibited good in vitro activity against different parasite strains (Y and Tulahuen) and against the two relevant forms of the parasite for mammalian hosts. Due to the excellent selective indexes of 18SAB075, this AIA was moved to in vivo tests for acute toxicity and parasite efficacy; nontoxic doses (no-observed-adverse-effect level [NOAEL], 50 mg/kg) were employed in the tests for parasite efficacy. In experimental models of acute T. cruzi infection, 18SAB075 reduced parasitemia levels only up to 50% and led to 40% protection against mortality (at 5 mg/kg of body weight), being less effective than the reference drug, benznidazole.

AB  - Triatoma brasiliensis is the most important vector of Chagas disease in the Caatinga eco-region of northeastern Brazil. Wild T. brasiliensis populations have been reported only from rocky outcrops. However, this species frequently infests/re-infests houses in rock-free sedimentary lowlands. We therefore hypothesized that it should also occupy other natural ecotopes. We show that a common Caatinga cactus, Pilosocereus gounellei, locally known as xiquexique, often harbors T. brasiliensis breeding colonies apparently associated with rodents (n = 44 cacti, infestation rate = 47.7%, 157 bugs captured). Our findings suggest that infested cacti might be involved in house re-infestation by T. brasiliensis in the Caatinga region.

AB  - Leishmania and Trypanosoma belong to the Trypanosomatidae family and cause important human infections such as leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and sleeping sickness. Leishmaniasis, caused by protozoa belonging to Leishmania, affects about 12 million people worldwide and can present different clinical manifestations, i.e., visceral leishmaniasis (VL), cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL), diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL), and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and is mainly prevalent in Latin America but is increasingly occurring in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Sleeping sickness or human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), caused by two sub-species of Trypanosoma brucei (i.e., T . b . rhodesiense and T. b . gambiense ), occurs only in sub-Saharan Africa countries. These pathogenic trypanosomatids alternate between invertebrate and vertebrate hosts throughout their lifecycles, and different developmental stages can live inside the host cells and circulate in the bloodstream or in the insect gut. Trypanosomatids have a classical eukaryotic ultrastructural organization with some of the same main organelles found in mammalian host cells, while also containing special structures and organelles that are absent in other eukaryotic organisms. For example, the mitochondrion is ramifi ed and contains a region known as the kinetoplast, which houses the mitochondrial DNA. Also, the glycosomes are specialized peroxisomes containing glycolytic pathway enzymes. Moreover, a layer of subpellicular microtubules confers mechanic rigidity to the cell. Some of these structures have been investigated to determine their function and identify potential enzymes and metabolic pathways that may constitute targets for new chemotherapeutic drugs. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.

AB  - Bromodomains are highly conserved acetyl-lysine binding domains found mainly in proteins associated with chromatin and nuclear acetyltransferases. The Trypanosoma cruzi genome encodes at least four bromodomain factors (TcBDFs). We describe here bromodomain factor 3 (TcBDF3), a bromodomain-containing protein localized in the cytoplasm. TcBDF3 cytolocalization was determined, using purified antibodies, by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses in all life cycle stages of T. cruzi. In epimastigotes and amastigotes, it was detected in the cytoplasm, the flagellum, and the flagellar pocket, and in trypomastigotes only in the flagellum. Subcellular localization of TcBDF3 was also determined by digitonin extraction, ultrastructural immunocytochemistry, and expression of TcBDF3 fused to cyan fluorescent protein (CFP). Tubulin can acquire different posttranslational modifications, which modulate microtubule functions. Acetylated α-tubulin has been found in the axonemes of flagella and cilia, as well as in the subpellicular microtubules of trypanosomatids. TcBDF3 and acetylated α-tubulin partially colocalized in isolated cytoskeletons and flagella from T. cruzi epimastigotes and trypomastigotes. Interaction between the two proteins was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and far-Western blot assays with synthetic acetylated α-tubulin peptides and recombinant TcBDF3. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Routine serological diagnoses for leishmaniases, except in visceral cases, are performed using whole-parasite antigens. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to evaluate the performance of Leishmania infantum rHsp83 compared with L. major-like total promastigote antigen in the diagnosis of cutaneous (CL), mucosal (ML), and visceral leishmaniases (VL). ELISA-rHsp83 was significantly more sensitive than ELISA-L. major-like when considering either CL/ML (P = 0.041) or all leishmaniasis patients (P = 0.013). When samples from other infectious disease patients were evaluated for cross-reactivity, ELISA-rHsp83 was more specific than ELISA-L. major-like, specifically for Chagas disease samples (P < 0.001). We also evaluated the anti-rHsp83 antibody titers months after treatment and observed no significant difference in ML (P = 0.607) or CL (P = 0.205). We recommend ELISA-L. infantum-rHsp83 as a routine confirmatory serological assay for the diagnosis of Leishmania infection because of the high sensitivity, the specificity, and the insignificant cross-reactivity with other infectious diseases.

AB  - Chagas disease induces a strong immune response and l-arginine is an essential amino acid which plays an important role in homeostasis of the immune system. The aims of this study were to evaluate parasitemia, corticosterone levels, production of nitric oxide (NO), fetal morphological measurements, and histology of heart and placenta. Twenty pregnant Wistar rats (180-220g) were grouped in: pregnant control (PC), pregnant control and l-arginine supplied (PCA), pregnant infected (PI), pregnant infected and l-arginine supplied (PIA). Females were infected with 1×105 trypomastigotes of the Y strain (3rd day of pregnancy). Animals were supplied with 21mg of l-arginine/kg/day during 14days. PIA showed significant decreased levels of corticosterone and parasitemia. For control groups, any alteration in NO production was found with l-arginine supplementation; for PIA, enhanced nitrite concentrations were observed as compared to PI. Weights and lengths of fetuses were higher in l-arginine treated and infected pregnant rats as compared to untreated ones. Placental weight from the PIA group was significantly increased when compared to PI. In l-arginine treated animals, cardiac tissue showed reduced amastigote burdens. PIA and PI displayed similar placental parasitism. Based on these results, l-arginine supplementation may be potentially useful for the protection against Trypanosoma cruzi during pregnancy. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Leishmaniasis and South American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) are part of a group of related human diseases endemic in tropical regions, especially among the poor. They are referred to as neglected diseases, because of a lack of interest on the part of the pharmaceutical industry. Today, chemotherapy is the only specific treatment against these diseases, the most frequently used drugs being nifurtimox and benznidazole. The aim of this study was to assess the antiparasitic and cytotoxic activity of the crude ethanolic leaf extract of Piper arboreum and its fractions against strains of Leishmania brasiliensis and Trypanosoma cruzi. After preparing the crude ethanolic extract and fractions, in vitro tests were performed to assay antiparasitic activity against T. cruzi, using the epimastigote clone CL-B5, while against L. brasiliensis, promastigote forms were used. The cytotoxicity assay was performed with a fibroblast cell line, NCTC 929. The results indicate that the samples possessed high toxicity, except for the ethyl acetate fraction. The results for antiparasitic activity showed highest activity in the hexane fraction, which was lethal to 62% and 51% of the epimastigotes and 100% and 92% of the promastigotes, at 500 and 100μg/ mL, respectively. From these results, it is concluded that P. arboreum can be considered an alternative source of natural products with activity against T. cruzi and L. brasiliensis.

AB  - The drugs available for Chagas disease treatment are toxic and ineffective. We studied the in vivo activity of a new drug, lychnopholide (LYC). LYC was loaded in nanocapsules (NC), and its effects were compared to free LYC and benznidazole against Trypanosoma cruzi. Infected mice were treated in the acute phase at 2.0 mg/kg/day with free LYC, LYC-poly-ε-caprolactone NC (LYC-PCL), and LYC-poly(lactic acid)-co-polyethylene glycol NC (LYC-PLA-PEG) or at 50 mg/kg/day with benznidazole solution by the intravenous route. Animals infected with the CL strain, treated 24 h after infection for 10 days, evaluated by hemoculture, PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay exhibited a 50% parasitological cure when treated with LYC-PCL NC and 100% cure when treated with benznidazole, but 100% of the animals treated during the prepatent period for 20 days with these formulations or LYC-PLA-PEG NC were cured. In animals with the Y strain treated 24 h after infection for 10 days, only mice treated by LYC-PCL NC were cured, but animals treated in the prepatent period for 20 days exhibited 100, 75, and 62.5% cure when treated with LYC-PLA-PEG NC, benznidazole, and LYC-PCL NC, respectively. Free LYC reduced the parasitemia and improved mice survival, but no mice were cured. LYC-loaded NC showed higher cure rates, reduced parasitemia, and increased survival when used in doses 2five times lower than those used for benznidazole. This study confirms that LYC is a potential new treatment for Chagas disease. Furthermore, the long-circulating property of PLA-PEG NC and its ability to improve LYC efficacy showed that this formulation is more effective in reaching the parasite in vivo.

AB  - This study evaluated the reactivity of membrane antigens of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis for the diagnosis of ACL by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Promastigotes of L. (V.) braziliensis were grown in medium 199 and lysed in a sonicator. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting showed that specific proteins of L. (V.) braziliensis (apparent molecular weights 36 kDa and 48-56 kDa) were recognized by sera from ACL patients. These proteins were eluted from the SDS-PAGE and tested in EIA-IgG with sera from ACL patients, healthy individuals, patients with toxoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, syphilis, tuberculosis, leprosy, and Chagas disease. The EIA-IgG with membrane antigens allowed us to distinguish patients with ACL from healthy individuals and patients with other diseases (P < 0.0001), and showed a sensitivity of 93.3% and specificity of 90.8%, not including Chagas disease patients. 2D-SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting was performed to improve the characterization of the antigens, and showed a component with isoelectric points near the acid pH side and apparent molecular weights of 48-56 kDa. The results showed good sensitivity and specificity of EIA-IgG with membrane antigens, indicating their potential use for diagnosis of ACL, as well as seroepidemiological surveys and follow-up of clinically cured patients. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Tryptase and chymase are mast cell (MC)-specific proteases, which influence in the activation of inflammatory cells. In this study, we quantified tryptase- or chymase-expressing MCs in the oesophaguses of Chagas patients, and searched for a correlation between those data with area of nerve fibres that expressed either PGP9.5 (pan-marker) or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), which is a neuromediator that has anti-inflammatory activity. Samples from the oesophaguses of 14 individuals Trypanosoma cruzi-infected and from six uninfected individuals were analysed by immunohistochemistry. It was demonstrated that the number of tryptase-IR MCs in infected individuals increased when compared with controls, regardless of whether the individuals had megaoesophagus, whereas the number of chymase-IR MCs increased only in infected individuals without megaoesophagus. Negative correlations were observed between tryptase-IR MCs and the density of nerve fibres that expressed VIP or PGP 9.5-IR. The participation of chymase and tryptase in this type of immunopathology is discussed. © 2014 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a zoonotic disease that is endemic to Brazil, where dogs are the main domestic parasite reservoirs, and the percentages of infected dogs living in regions where canine VL (CVL) is endemic have ranged from 10% to 62%. Despite technological advances, some problems have been reported with CVL serodiagnosis. The present study describes a sequential subtractive selection through phage display technology from polyclonal antibodies of negative and positive sera that resulted in the identification of potential bacteriophage-fused peptides that were highly sensitive and specific to antibodies of CVL. A negative selection was performed in which phage clones were adhered to purified IgGs from healthy and Trypanosoma cruzi-infected dogs to eliminate cross-reactive phages. The remaining supernatant nonadhered phages were submitted to positive selection against IgG from the blood serum of dogs that were infected with Leishmania infantum. Phage clones that adhered to purified IgGs from the CVL-infected serum samples were selected. Eighteen clones were identified and their reactivities tested by a phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (phage-ELISA) against the serum samples from infected dogs (n = 31) compared to those from vaccinated dogs (n = 21), experimentally infected dogs with cross-reactive parasites (n = 23), and healthy controls (n = 17). Eight clones presented sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 100%, and they showed no cross-reactivity with T. cruzi- or Ehrlichia canis-infected dogs or with dogs vaccinated with two different commercial CVL vaccines in Brazil. Our study identified eight mimotopes of L. infantum antigens with 100% accuracy for CVL serodiagnosis. The use of these mimotopes by phage-ELISA proved to be an excellent assay that was reproducible, simple, fast, and inexpensive, and it can be applied in CVL-monitoring programs.

AB  - Exposure to Trypanosoma cruzi parasites induces monocytes and macrophages to produce various endogenous mediators, including prostaglandins and cytokines. To clarify the involvement of monocytes as an important source of inflammatory mediators in Chagas disease patients, we evaluated PBMC before and after depletion of adherent cells (monocytes) from patients with indeterminate (IND) and cardiac (CARD) clinical forms and from non-infected individuals (NI). We demonstrated that after the partial depletion of adherent cells, production of PGE2 was slightly decreased in patients with Chagas disease. Inhibition of the cells by indomethacin increased the proliferation in PBMC cells from patients after antigen stimulation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines as IL-2 and IFN-γ also had a greater decrease after partial depletion of adherent cells in both clinical forms of Chagas disease. IL-10 and IL-5 levels were also reduced after partial depletion of adherent cells both in IND and CARD patients. In addition, we evaluated the APC potential of B cells and observed that the MHCII and CD80 molecules had an increased expression after partial depletion of most monocytes in all groups. Thus, inflammatory mediators produced by monocytes seem to be important to modulate immune responses in Chagas disease by regulating the processes of inflammation and antigen presentation. © 2013 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance Byrsonima verbascifolia is used in folk medicine to treat diarrhea, intestinal infections, chronic wounds, Chagas disease, inflammation and as a diuretic. However there is no investigation regarding the Byrsonima verbascifolia hydrometanolic extract (BVHME) used during gestation. Materials and methods The pregnant females were randomly divided into 5 groups. Control group received saline plus DMSO (1%) in a volume of 0.1 mL/10 g (b.w.), via gavage, for at least 15 days prior to mating and throughout the gestational period. The Pre-treatment group received the BVHME, via gavage, at a dose of 50 mg/kg (b.w.) for at least 15 days prior to mating and up to the appearance of the vaginal plug. The Organogenesis group received the BVHME at a dose of 50 mg/kg (b.w.), via gavage, on the 5-15th gestational day. The Gestational group received the BVHME at a dose of 50 mg/kg (b.w.), via gavage, throughout the gestational period (from the 1st to the 18th day of pregnancy). The Pre+Gestational group received the BVHME at a dose of 50 mg/kg (b.w.), via gavage, for at least 15 days prior to mating and up to throughout the gestational period. The clinical signals of maternal and fetuses toxicity were evaluated, as the mutagenicity and immunomodulation tests were performed. Results and conclusions The present investigation shows, for the first time, that the use of Byrsonima verbascifolia extract in pregnant Swiss mice, did not alter the female reproductive function, mutagenicity or immunostimulation as well as not interfere with embryofetal development at least in our experimental conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - In the order Chiroptera, more than 30 trypanosome species belonging to the subgenera Herpetosoma, Schizotrypanum, Megatrypanum, and Trypanozoon have been described. The species Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei, and Trypanosoma dionisii are the most common in bats and belong to the Schizotrypanum subgenus. Bats from 2 different biomes, Pantanal and Amazonia/Cerrado in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, were evaluated according to the presence of trypanosome parasites by means of hemoculture and PCR in primary samples (blood samples). A total of 211 bats from 20 different species were caught and the trypanosome prevalence, evaluated through hemoculture, was 9.0% (19), 15.5% (13), and 4.8% (6) in the municipalities of Confresa (Amazonia/Cerrado biome) and Poconé (Pantanal biome). Among the 123 primary samples obtained from the bats, only 3 (2.4%) were positive. Phylogenetic analysis using trypanosomatid barcoding (V7V8 region of SSU rDNA) identified all the isolates and primary samples as T. c. marinkellei. The sequences of the isolates were segregated according to the bat host genus or species and suggest that co-evolutionary patterns exist between hosts and parasites. Further studies in different Brazilian regions and biomes need to be conducted in order to gain real understanding of the diversity of trypanosomes in bats. © 2013 American Society of Parasitologists.

AB  - Diagnosing canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is a critical challenge since conventional immunoserological tests still present some deficiencies. The current study evaluated a prototype flow cytometry serology test, using antigens and fluorescent antibodies that had been stored for 1 year at 4°C, on a broad range of serum samples. Noninfected control dogs and Leishmania infantum-infected dogs were tested, and the prototype test showed excellent performance in differentiating these groups with high sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy (100% in all analyses). When the CVL group was evaluated according to the dogs' clinical status, the prototype test showed outstanding accuracy in all groups with positive serology (asymptomatic II, oligosymptomatic, and symptomatic). However, in dogs which had positive results by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) but negative results by conventional serology (asymptomatic I), serological reactivity was not observed. Additionally, sera from 40 dogs immunized with different vaccines (Leishmune, Leish-Tec, or LBSap) did not present serological reactivity in the prototype test. Eighty-eight dogs infected with other pathogens (Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania braziliensis, Ehrlichia canis, and Babesia canis) were used to determine cross-reactivity and specificity, and the prototype test performed well, particularly in dogs infected with B. canis and E. canis (100% and 93.3% specificities, respectively). In conclusion, our data reinforce the potential of the prototype test for use as a commercial kit and highlight its outstanding performance even after storage for 1 year at 4°C. Moreover, the prototype test efficiently provided accurate CVL serodiagnosis with an absence of false-positive results in vaccinated dogs and minor cross-reactivity against other canine pathogens.

AB  - Background Left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) diastolic function analysis can yield new strategies to recognize early cardiac involvement and prognostic indicators in Chagas disease. Methods Patients with Chagas disease with the indeterminate (n = 69) or with the cardiac form (32 with changes limited to electrocardiography [stage A], 25 with changes in LV systolic function but no heart failure [HF; stage B], and 26 with HF) underwent evaluation of LV diastolic function (mitral inflow, pulmonary vein flow, color M-mode echocardiography, and tissue Doppler analysis), and LA function by three-dimensional echocardiography and strain analysis and were prospectively followed for the occurrence of clinical events. Echocardiograms were also obtained from 32 controls. Results LV diastolic dysfunction was gradually more prevalent and severe across groups from patients with the indeterminate form of Chagas disease to patients with HF. Tissue Doppler was the best tool to demonstrate the worsening of LV diastolic function across the groups (E′ velocity: controls, 12.6 ± 2.3 cm/sec; patients with the indeterminate form, 12.1 ± 3.1 cm/sec; stage A, 10.3 ± 2.9 cm/sec; stage B, 8.3 ± 2.8 cm/sec; patients with HF, 5.6 ± 1.9; P &lt;.0001). Although maximum LA volume was increased only in patients with HF, minimum LA volume (controls, 8 ± 2 mL/m2; patients with the indeterminate form, 8 ± 2 mL/m2; stage A, 9 ± 3 mL/m2; stage B, 11 ± 4 mL/m2; patients with HF, 27 ± 17 mL/m 2; P &lt;.0001) and precontraction LA volume (controls, 11 ± 3 mL/m2; patients with the indeterminate form, 12 ± 3 mL/m 2; stage A, 13 ± 4 mL/m2; stage B, 16 ± 5 mL/m2; patients with HF, 32 ± 19 mL/m2; P &lt;.0001) were increased in all cardiac form groups. LA conductive function was depressed in all cardiac form groups, while LA contractile function was depressed only in patients with HF. Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis revealed that end-systolic LV diameter (hazard ratio, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-2.8; P =.09), E′ velocity (hazard ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.8; P =.001), and peak negative global LA strain (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.4; P =.03), were independent predictors of clinical events. Conclusions LV diastolic dysfunction was found in all forms of chronic Chagas disease, including those without LV systolic dysfunction. LV diastolic dysfunction may contribute to changes in LA volume and conductive function found in early stages of the cardiac form. Both LV diastolic function and LA contractile function were independent predictors of clinical events. © 2013 by the American Society of Echocardiography.

AB  - Background: Familial aggregation of Chagas cardiac disease in T. cruzi-infected persons suggests that human genetic variation may be an important determinant of disease progression. Objective: To perform a GWAS using a well-characterized cohort to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes associated with cardiac outcomes. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was developed by the NHLBI REDS-II program in Brazil. Samples were collected from 499 T. cruzi seropositive blood donors who had donated between1996 and 2002, and 101 patients with clinically diagnosed Chagas cardiomyopathy. In 2008-2010, all subjects underwent a complete medical examination. After genotype calling, quality control filtering with exclusion of 20 cases, and imputation of 1,000 genomes variants; association analysis was performed for 7 cardiac and parasite related traits, adjusting for population stratification. Results: The cohort showed a wide range of African, European, and modest Native American admixture proportions, consistent with the recent history of Brazil. No SNPs were found to be highly (P&lt;10-8) associated with cardiomyopathy. The two mostly highly associated SNPs for cardiomyopathy (rs4149018 and rs12582717; P-values &lt;10-6) are located on Chromosome 12p12.2 in the SLCO1B1 gene, a solute carrier family member. We identified 44 additional genic SNPs associated with six traits at P-value &lt;10-6: Ejection Fraction, PR, QRS, QT intervals, antibody levels by EIA, and parasitemia by PCR. Conclusion: This GWAS identified suggestive SNPs that may impact the risk of progression to cardiomyopathy. Although this Chagas cohort is the largest examined by GWAS to date, (580 subjects), moderate sample size may explain in part the limited number of significant SNP variants. Enlarging the current sample through expanded cohorts and meta-analyses, and targeted studies of candidate genes, will be required to confirm and extend the results reported here. Future studies should also include exposed seronegative controls to investigate genetic associations with susceptibility or resitance to T. cruzi infection and non-Chagas cardiomathy. © 2013 Deng et al.

AB  - Objective: To determine the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SIH) and in-hospital mortality among patients with acute ischemic stroke related to Chagas disease (CD) treated with IV tissue plasminogen activator (TPA). Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, consecutive stroke patients treated with IV TPA and routinely tested for CD were retrospectively selected from a single-center, hospital-based, prospective registry of acute stroke patients from 2001 to 2012. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the registry as well as in-hospital mortality. CT scans were blindly reviewed to assess the occurrence of hemorrhagic transformation. Among acute stroke patients who received IV TPA, we compared those with and without a positive serology for CD. Results: Among 240 patients treated with IV TPA, 174 had serologic testing for CD available. Of those, 24 patients (13.8%) had positive serology for CD. Patients with CD more frequently had heart failure (45.8% vs 14.7%; p < 0.01) and higher admission NIH Stroke Scale scores (19 [15-21] vs 13 [8-19]; p < 0.01) than patients with negative serology. The rates of SIH (4.2% vs 5.3%; odds ratio: 0.77; 95% confidence interval: 0.09-6.46; p = 0.99) and in-hospital death (16.7% vs 11.3%; odds ratio: 1.57; 95% confidence interval: 0.48-5.12; p = 0.50) were not higher among patients with CD. Conclusion: In the largest published series of patients with CD-related stroke treated with IV TPA, we have observed that IV thrombolysis was safely performed and showed no increase of SIH. The diagnosis of CD should not preclude IV thrombolysis in these patients. © 2013 American Academy of Neurology.

AB  - In vitro and in vivo activities against Trypanosoma cruzi were evaluated for two sesquiterpene lactones: psilostachyin A and cynaropicrin. Cynaropicrin had previously been shown to potently inhibit African trypanosomes in vivo, and psilostachyin A had been reported to show in vivo effects against T. cruzi, albeit in another test design. In vitro data showed that cynaropicrin was more effective than psilostachyin A. Ultrastructural alterations induced by cynaropicrin included shedding events, detachment of large portions of the plasma membrane, and vesicular bodies and large vacuoles containing membranous structures, suggestive of parasite autophagy. Acute toxicity studies showed that one of two mice died at a cynaropicrin dose of 400 mg/kg of body weight given intraperitoneally (i.p.). Although no major plasma biochemical alterations could be detected, histopathology demonstrated that the liver was the most affected organ in cynaropicrin-treated animals. Although cynaropicrin was as effective as benznidazole against trypomastigotes in vitro, the treatment (once or twice a day) of T. cruzi-infected mice (up to 50 mg/kg/day cynaropicrin) did not suppress parasitemia or protect against mortality induced by the Y and Colombiana strains. Psilostachyin A (0.5 to 50 mg/kg/day given once a day) was not effective in the acute model of T. cruzi infection (Y strain), reaching 100% animal mortality. Our data demonstrate that although it is very promising against African trypanosomes, cynaropicrin does not show efficacy compared to benznidazole in acute mouse models of T. cruzi infection.

AB  - Malaria and American Trypanosomiasis constitute major global health problems. The continued emergence and spreading of resistant strains and the limited efficacy and/or safety of currently available therapeutic agents require a constant search for new sources of antiparasitic compounds. In the present study, a fraction enriched in tight-binding protease inhibitors was isolated from the Caribbean coral Plexaura homomalla (Esper, 1792), functionally characterized and tested for their antiparasitic activity against Trypanosoma cruzi and Plasmodium falciparum. The resultant fraction was chromatographically enriched in tight-binding inhibitors active against Papain-like cysteine peptidases (92%) and Pepsin-like aspartyl peptidases (8%). Globally, the inhibitors present in the enriched fraction showed no competition with substrates and apparent Ki values of 1.99 and 4.81nM for Falcipain 2 and Cruzipain, the major cysteine peptidases from P. falciparum and T. cruzi, respectively. The inhibitor-enriched fraction showed promising antiparasitic activity in cultures. It reduced the growth of the chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strain Dd2 (IC50=0.46μM) and promoted the apparent accumulation of trophozoites, both consistent with a blockade in the hemoglobin degradation pathway. At sub-micromolar concentrations, the inhibitor-enriched fraction reduced the infection of VERO cells by T. cruzi (CL Brener clone) trypomastigotes and interfered with intracellular differentiation and/or replication of the parasites. This study provides new scientific evidence that confirms P. homomalla as an excellent source of tight-biding protease inhibitors for different proteases with biomedical relevance, and suggests that either the individual inhibitors or the enriched fraction itself could be valuable as antiparasitic compounds. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - (-)-Epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate (1), the most abundant flavanol in green tea, has been reported to have antiproliferative effects on Trypanosoma cruzi. The present study reports the effects in vitro and in vivo of 1 on Leishmania amazonensis. L. amazonensis-infected macrophages treated with 1 exhibited a significant reduction of the infection index in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 1.6 μM. Oral administration of 1 on L. amazonensis-infected BALB/c mice (30 mg/kg/day) resulted in a decrease in the lesion size and parasite burden, without altering serological markers of toxicity. These data demonstrate the in vitro and in vivo leishmanicidal effects of compound 1. © 2013 The American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.

AB  - A new series of 4-aminopyridyl-based lead inhibitors targeting Trypanosoma cruzi CYP51 (TcCYP51) has been developed using structure-based drug design as well as structure-property relationship (SPR) analyses. The screening hit starting point, LP10 (KD ≤ 42 nM; EC50 = 0.65 μM), has been optimized to give the potential leads 14t, 27i, 27q, 27r, and 27t, which have low-nanomolar binding affinity to TcCYP51 and significant activity against T. cruzi amastigotes cultured in human myoblasts (EC50 = 14-18 nM for 27i and 27r). Many of the optimized compounds have improved microsome stability, and most are selective against human CYPs 1A2, 2D6, and 3A4 (&lt;50% inhibition at 1 μM). A rationale for the improvement in microsome stability and selectivity of inhibitors against human metabolic CYP enzymes is presented. In addition, the binding mode of 14t with the Trypanosoma brucei CYP51 (TbCYP51) orthologue has been characterized by X-ray structure analysis. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The present study focused on spermatophore structure, transfer, and subsequent destination inside bloodfeeding females of the species Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius neglectus. The morphology of the spermatophore differed between the species studied, such that in T. infestans, the shape was ovaloid, whereas in R. neglectus, the shape resembled a rod. Structures' spine-like cuticulars distributed across the inner surface of the vagina of both species were observed; however, the role of these cuticulars is unknown in Triatominae. In both species, there was an opening in the spermatophore exactly where the common oviduct is connected, thereby making it possible to confirm that the process of spermatozoid migration takes place through this opening. The results obtained show that the spermatophores of T. infestans and R. neglectus differ in size, shape, and structure. Therefore, they can be used as taxonomic markers and may provide information regarding physiology and evolution. Copyright © 2013 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB  - The interconnection between immune and neuroendocrine systems influences regulation of inflammatory responses. The possible relevance that this integrative response may have during the course of Chagas disease remains poorly characterized. In this context, our study was designed to determine the expression of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), a neuropeptide with anti-inflammatory properties, in blood from the indeterminate and cardiac polarized forms of Chagas disease. Moreover, we determined whether the differential expression of VIP is associated with the development of cardiomyopathy in individuals infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. Finally, we analyzed gene polymorphisms of VIP receptors, VPAC1 and VPAC2, and performed correlation analysis of these polymorphisms with the different clinical forms of Chagas disease. Our results demonstrated that low plasma levels of VIP were associated with the cardiac morbidity in Chagas disease. Accordingly, correlation analysis showed that low plasma levels of VIP were associated with worse cardiac function, as determined by left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular diastolic diameter values. Polymorphism analysis showed a significant association between VPAC1 and the indeterminate form of Chagas disease development. Our data indicate that VIP expression and its receptors' polymorphism may be important in determining susceptibility to progression from mild to severe forms of Chagas disease. © 2013 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.

AB  - Dilated chronic cardiomyopathy (DCC) from Chagas disease is associated with myocardial remodeling and interstitial fibrosis, resulting in extracellular matrix (ECM) changes. In this study, we characterized for the first time the serum matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 levels, as well as their main cell sources in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients presenting with the indeterminate (IND) or cardiac (CARD) clinical form of Chagas disease. Our results showed that serum levels of MMP-9 are associated with the severity of Chagas disease. The analysis of MMP production by T lymphocytes showed that CD8+ T cells are the main mononuclear leukocyte source of both MMP-2 and MMP-9 molecules. Using a new 3-dimensional model of fibrosis, we observed that sera from patients with Chagas disease induced an increase in the extracellular matrix components in cardiac spheroids. Furthermore, MMP-2 and MMP-9 showed different correlations with matrix proteins and inflammatory cytokines in patients with Chagas disease. Our results suggest that MMP-2 and MMP-9 show distinct activities in Chagas disease pathogenesis. While MMP-9 seems to be involved in the inflammation and cardiac remodeling of Chagas disease, MMP-2 does not correlate with inflammatory molecules. ©2013, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - The innate immune response to Trypanosoma cruzi infection comprises several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including TLR-2, -4, -7, and -9, as well as the cytosolic receptor Nod1. However, there are additional PRRs that account for the host immune responses to T. cruzi. In this context, the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) that activate the inflammasomes are candidate receptors that deserve renewed investigation. Following pathogen infection, NLRs form large molecular platforms, termed inflammasomes, which activate caspase-1 and induce the production of active IL-1b and IL-18. In this study, we evaluated the involvement of inflammasomes in T. cruzi infection and demonstrated that apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) inflammasomes, including NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), but not NLR family, caspase recruitment domain-containing 4 or NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 6, are required for triggering the activation of caspase-1 and the secretion of IL-1b. The mechanism by which T. cruzi mediates the activation of the ASC/NLRP3 pathway involves K+ efflux, lysosomal acidification, reactive oxygen species generation, and lysosomal damage. We also demonstrate that despite normal IFN-γ production in the heart, ASC-/- and caspase-1 -/- infected mice exhibit a higher incidence of mortality, cardiac parasitism, and heart inflammation. These data suggest that ASC inflammasomes are critical determinants of host resistance to infection with T. cruzi. Copyright © 2013 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.

AB  - Chagas disease affects more than 10 million people worldwide, and yet, as it has historically been known as a disease of the poor, it remains highly neglected. Two currently available drugs exhibit severe toxicity and low effectiveness, especially in the chronic phase, while new drug discovery has been halted for years as a result of a lack of interest from pharmaceutical companies. Although attempts to repurpose the antifungal drugs posaconazole and ravuconazole (inhibitors of fungal sterol 14-demethylase [CYP51]) are finally in progress, development of cheaper and more efficient, preferably Trypanosoma cruzi-specific, chemotherapies would be highly advantageous. Wehave recently reported that the experimental T. cruzi CYP51 inhibitor VNI cures with 100% survival and 100% parasitological clearance both acute and chronic murine infections with the Tulahuen strain of T. cruzi. In this work, we further explored the potential of VNI by assaying nitro-derivative-resistant T. cruzi strains, Y and Colombiana, in highly stringent protocols of acute infection. The data show high antiparasitic efficacy of VNI and its derivative (VNI/VNF) against both forms of T. cruzi that are relevant for mammalian host infection (bloodstream and amastigotes), with the in vivo potency, at 25 mg/kg twice a day (b.i.d.), similar to that of benznidazole (100 mg/kg/day). Transmission electron microscopy and reverse mutation tests were performed to explore cellular ultrastructural and mutagenic aspects of VNI, respectively. No mutagenic potential could be seen by the Ames test at up to 3.5-M, and the main ultrastructural damage induced by VNI in T. cruzi was related to Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum organization, with membrane blebs presenting an autophagic phenotype. Thus, these preliminary studies confirm VNI as a very promising trypanocidal drug candidate for Chagas disease therapy. Copyright © 2013, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Background: Bat trypanosomes have been implicated in the evolutionary history of the T. cruzi clade, which comprises species from a wide geographic and host range in South America, Africa and Europe, including bat-restricted species and the generalist agents of human American trypanosomosis T. cruzi and T. rangeli. Methods. Trypanosomes from bats (Rhinolophus landeri and Hipposideros caffer) captured in Mozambique, southeast Africa, were isolated by hemoculture. Barcoding was carried out through the V7V8 region of Small Subunit (SSU) rRNA and Fluorescent Fragment Length barcoding (FFLB). Phylogenetic inferences were based on SSU rRNA, glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) and Spliced Leader (SL) genes. Morphological characterization included light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Results: New trypanosomes from bats clustered together forming a clade basal to a larger assemblage called the T. cruzi clade. Barcoding, phylogenetic analyses and genetic distances based on SSU rRNA and gGAPDH supported these trypanosomes as a new species, which we named Trypanosoma livingstonei n. sp. The large and highly polymorphic SL gene repeats of this species showed a copy of the 5S ribosomal RNA into the intergenic region. Unique morphological (large and broad blood trypomastigotes compatible to species of the subgenus Megatrypanum and cultures showing highly pleomorphic epimastigotes and long and slender trypomastigotes) and ultrastructural (cytostome and reservosomes) features and growth behaviour (when co-cultivated with HeLa cells at 37°C differentiated into trypomastigotes resembling the blood forms and do not invaded the cells) complemented the description of this species. Conclusion: Phylogenetic inferences supported the hypothesis that Trypanosoma livingstonei n. sp. diverged from a common ancestral bat trypanosome that evolved exclusively in Chiroptera or switched at independent opportunities to mammals of several orders forming the clade T. cruzi, hence, providing further support for the bat seeding hypothesis to explain the origin of T. cruzi and T. rangeli. © 2013 Lima et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The resistance of triatomines to pyrethroids has been reported in several Latin American countries, including Brazil, indicating the need for the development of new approaches for the control of vectors of the Chagas disease. In here, we evaluated the insecticidal potential of the essential oil of Eucalyptus urograndis (Myrtaceae) against unsexed third and fourth instars of Rhodnius neglectus Lent (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) in topical application, fumigation, surface contact, and repellency. The insecticidal activity of the essential oil tested was detected by topical application (LD50 = 0.1731 μL/insect and LD99 = 0.2948 μL/insect for 24 h), fumigation (LC50 = 0.021 mL/mL air and LC99 = 0.1525 mL/mL air for 24 h) and surface contact (LC50 = 0.7073 μL/cm2 and LC99 = 4.59 μL/cm2 for 24 h). Mortality observed after 48-72-h exposure was very high and did not allow for any adjustment of the mortality curve. In the repellency assay, an effect was observed on 80% of tested nymphs. However, no repellency was observed after 24 h of exposure. Eucalyptus urograndis essential oil has a high insecticidal and repellent potential for R. neglectus nymphs, whether serving as a molecular model for new substances or as an alternative for the control of these insects. © 2013 Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

AB  - Background & aims: The occurrence of infectious disease processes during pregnancy has significant effects on maternal health and can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. The aim of the present study was to examine the potential role of zinc treatment during Trypanosoma cruzi infection in pregnant animals. Methods: Female Wistar rats weighing 180-200g were used in all experiments. Production of nitric oxide, peritoneal macrophages counts, and concentrations of IFN-γ and TNF-α were measured, and the potential protective effects of zinc on fetal development were assessed at 14-day post-infection. Results: Nitric oxide concentrations were higher in pregnant zinc-treated animals than in their untreated counterparts, despite similar levels of the macrophages, IFN-γ and TNF-α. Zinc therapy was associated with a significant reduction in parasitemia and cardiac parasite burden. Higher placental and birth weights were observed in animals given prenatal zinc supplementation compared to untreated animals. Conclusions: These data confirm the critical importance of adequate zinc intake during the peri-conceptional period and indicate that zinc has an effective role in preventing adverse outcomes of pregnancy and reducing the risk of common infections such as Chagas' disease. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy is a common neurological disorder. There may be important differences and similarities in the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy between North America (NA) and South America (SA). Neuromuscular databases were searched for neuropathy diagnosis at two North American sites, University of Kansas Medical Center and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and one South American site, Federal Fluminense University in Brazil. All patients were included into one of the six major categories: immune-mediated, diabetic, hereditary, infectious/inflammatory, systemic/metabolic/toxic (not diabetic) and cryptogenic. A comparison of the number of patients in each category was made between North America and South America databases. Total number of cases in North America was 1090 and in South America was 1034 immune-mediated: NA 215 (19.7%), SA 191 (18%); diabetic: NA 148 (13.5%), SA 236 (23%); hereditary: NA 292 (26.7%), SA 103 (10%); infectious/inflammatory: NA 53 (4.8%), SA 141 (14%); systemic/metabolic/toxic: NA 71 (6.5%), SA 124 (12%); cryptogenic: NA 311 (28.5%), SA 239 (23%). Some specific neuropathy comparisons were hereditary neuropathies Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) cases in NA 246/292 (84.2%) and SA 60/103 (58%); familial amyloid neuropathy in SA 31/103 (30%) and none in NA. Among infectious neuropathies, cases of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) neuropathy in SA were 36/141(25%), Chagas disease in SA were 13/141(9%) and none for either in NA; cases of neuropathy due to leprosy in NA were 26/53 (49%) and in SA were 39/141(28%). South American tertiary care centers are more likely to see patients with infectious, diabetic and hereditary disorders such as familial amyloid neuropathies. North American tertiary centers are more likely to see patients with CMT. Immune neuropathies and cryptogenic neuropathies were seen equally in North America and South America.

AB  - Background: Chagas cardiomyopathy and ischemic heart disease (IHD) are frequent causes of chronic systolic heart failure (CHF) in areas where the former is endemic. Nonetheless, a specific comparison of outcome and role of etiology of CHF failure has not been performed in patients with both conditions. Methods: Two-hundred twenty two patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy and 79 with IHD with CHF were included in the study. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to establish independent predictors of mortality for the studied population. Survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meir product limit method. Results: In the multivariable model, Beta-Blocker therapy [(hazard ratio (HR) = 0.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.52; p < 0.005)], Chagas etiology of CHF (HR = 3.6; 95% CI 2.0 to 6.5; p < 0.005), serum sodium levels (HR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.91 to 0.98; p < 0.005), digoxin use (HR = 2.1; 95% CI 1.19 to 3.80, p = 0.01), and spironolactone use (HR = 1.7; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.80; p = 0.02) were determined independent predictors of all-cause mortality for this cohort. Probability of survival at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months was 92%, 92%, 88%, 81%, and 78%, respectively, in IHD patients, and 79%, 61%, 49%, 41%, and 35%, respectively, in Chagas cardiomyopathy patients (p < 0.005). Conclusion: Outcome in patients with chronic systolic heart failure secondary to Chagas cardiomyopathy is poorer than that seen in those with IHD. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, encodes for an α-carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) possessing high catalytic activity (TcCA) which was recently characterized (Pan et al. J. Med. Chem. 2013, 56, 1761-1771). A new class of sulfonamides possessing low nanomolar/subnanomolar TcCA inhibitory activity is described here. Aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides incorporating halogeno/methoxyphenacetamido tails inhibited TcCA with K Is in the range of 0.5-12.5 nM, being less effective against the human off-target isoforms hCA I and II. A homology model of TcCA helped us to rationalize the excellent inhibition profile of these compounds against the protozoan enzyme, a putative new antitrypanosoma drug target. These compounds were ineffective antitrypanosomal agents in vivo due to penetrability problems of these highly polar molecules that possess sulfonamide moieties. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan that causes Chagas' disease, a neglected infectious illness that affects millions of people, mostly in Latin America. Here, the cell surface subproteome of the T. cruzi epimastigote life form was characterized. In order to prepare samples enriched in epimastigote plasma membrane protein, two distinct methodologies were optimized and evaluated. The first methodology was based on cell surface trypsinization (Shave) of intact living cells while the second approach used biotinylation of cell surface proteins followed by streptavidin affinity chromatography isolation of the labeled proteins. Both T. cruzi subproteomes were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The results showed that the methodologies offered comprehensive and complementary information about the parasite's plasma membrane subproteome. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) caused by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis is a neglected disease of humans in the New World that may also cause irreversible skin and eventually mucocutaneous lesions. This parasite can also infect dogs and represents a diagnostic challenge for veterinarians. Methods currently available for the diagnosis of ACL have a low sensitivity and may be time-consuming, representing a limit for treatment expedition of ACL. Quantitative real time PCR assays (qPCR) for the detection of L. (V.) braziliensis in canine blood samples were developed herein, and the detection limit and specificity of different molecular targets (kDNA and rDNA) evaluated. Of the protocols assessed, two qPCR assays, one targeting the kDNA and other the SSU rDNA of L. (V.) braziliensis, performed better, with detection limits of 100 fg and 10 pg, respectively. These assays were also used to test skin samples from humans with suspected ACL. The results indicate that the qPCR protocols developed represent an advance for the diagnosis of ACL in dogs and humans from this region, and provide a rapid and non-invasive diagnosis of the infection by L. (V.) braziliensis. Considering the quantitative nature of the assays, they will also be useful for monitoring treatment efficacy and preventing relapses in human patients in Brazil, although further studies are needed to critically evaluate the specificity of the qPCRs for their capacity to distinguish different Leishmania species and subspecies (represented by zymodemes) in other countries. Finally, molecular assays established may represent new tools for future basic and applied research focused on species identification, host-parasite associations, and infection dynamics in host and vector populations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Introduction. Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic mycosis in Latin America that can affect various organs. Few case reports of paracoccidioidomycosis affecting the prostate are found in the literature. Case presentation. We present the case of a 79-year-old Caucasian man with a six-month history of irritative symptoms of the prostate (urgency, frequency and nocturia) and difficulty initiating urination that progressed to urinary retention and the use of a urinary catheter. The anatomopathological analysis of the transurethral resection of the prostate revealed chronic granulomatous prostatitis of fungal etiology (paracoccidioidomycosis) with extensive necrosis. The patient began treatment with itraconazole at a dose of 100mg/day for six months. Radiography of the thorax revealed bilaterally diffuse nodular reticular interstitial lesions. The patient progressed to respiratory failure and was sent to the intensive care unit, but suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest and was pronounced dead. Conclusions: Due to the high incidence of paracoccidioidomycosis in countries like Brazil, urologists should suspect blastomycosis in all patients with symptoms of lower urinary obstruction with chronic abacterial prostatitis. Considering that paracoccidioidomycosis has the potential to affect various organs, following diagnosis, the treatment must be initiated as soon as possible. © 2013 de Arruda et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and is transmitted by insects from the Triatominae subfamily. To identify components involved in the protozoan-vector relationship, we constructed and analyzed cDNA libraries from RNA isolated from the midguts of uninfected and T. cruzi-infected Triatoma infestans, which are major vectors of Chagas disease. We generated approximately 440 high-quality Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) from each T. infestans midgut cDNA library. The sequences were grouped in 380 clusters, representing an average length of 664.78 base pairs (bp). Many clusters were not classified functionally, representing unknown transcripts. Several transcripts involved in different processes (e.g., detoxification) showed differential expression in response to T. cruzi infection. Lysozyme, cathepsin D, a nitrophorin-like protein and a putative 14 kDa protein were significantly upregulated upon infection, whereas thioredoxin reductase was downregulated. In addition, we identified several transcripts related to metabolic processes or immunity with unchanged expressions, including infestin, lipocalins and defensins. We also detected ESTs encoding juvenile hormone binding protein (JHBP), which seems to be involved in insect development and could be a target in control strategies for the vector. This work demonstrates differential gene expression upon T. cruzi infection in the midgut of T. infestans. These data expand the current knowledge regarding vector-parasite interactions for Chagas disease. © 2013 Buarque et al.

AB  - Inflammation is powerful response to destroy invading organisms, and an exaggerated response can lead to death of the host. Macrophages secrete mediators that activated circulating neutrophils leading to its migration into infectious site. Recently, it has been shown that lymphocytes have an action modulating the early phase of inflammatory response. In this article, we analyze the role of B1 in the inflammatory response of different origins and finally focus attention on sepsis. B lymphocyte deficiency has been linked to acute infection presumably owing to the lack of an adaptive immune response to effectively clear pathogens. Individuals with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) present B1 lymphocyte deficiency caused by mutations in the Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk). Some data show that B1 cells might contribute to susceptibility in experimental paracoccidioidomycosis. On the other hand, B1 cells are shown to be detrimental in other mouse models of microbial infection, such as experimental Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and Staphylococcus aureus-induced arthritis. B1 cell plays a protective role in the host of the effects of endotoxemia. In a murine model of endotoxemia by lipopolysaccharide, B1 cell participates in both interleukin 10 and immunoglobulin M secretion with a consequent reduction in mortality.

AB  - The development of an accurate antigen detection assay for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) would represent a major clinical advance. Here, we demonstrate that the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv1681 protein is a biomarker for active TB with potential diagnostic utility. We initially identified, by mass spectroscopy, peptides from the Rv1681 protein in urine specimens from 4 patients with untreated active TB. Rabbit IgG anti-recombinant Rv1681 detected Rv1681 protein in lysates and culture filtrates of M. tuberculosis and immunoprecipitated it from pooled urine specimens from two TB patients. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay formatted with these antibodies detected Rv1681 protein in unconcentrated urine specimens from 11/25 (44%) TB patients and 1/21 (4.8%) subjects in whom TB was initially clinically suspected but then ruled out by conventional methods. Rv1681 protein was not detected in urine specimens from 10 subjects with Escherichia coli-positive urine cultures, 26 subjects with confirmed non-TB tropical diseases (11 with schistosomiasis, 5 with Chagas' disease, and 10 with cutaneous leishmaniasis), and 14 healthy subjects. These results provide strong validation of Rv1681 protein as a promising biomarker for TB diagnosis. Copyright © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - The mechanisms by which Trypanosoma cruzi survives antimicrobial peptides and differentiates during its transit through the gastrointestinal tract of the reduviid vector are unknown. We show that cyclophilin, a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase secreted from T. cruzi epimastigotes, binds to and neutralizes the reduviid antimicrobial peptide trialysin promoting parasite survival. This is dependent on a singular proline residue in trialysin and is inhibited by the cyclophilin inhibitor cyclosporine A. In addition, cyclophilin-trialysin complexes enhance the production of ATP and reductase responses of parasites, which are inhibited by both calcineurin-specific inhibitors cyclosporine A and FK506. Calcineurin phosphatase activity of cyclophilin-trialysin- treated parasites was higher than in controls and was inhibited by preincubation by either inhibitor. Parasites exposed to cyclophilin-trialysin have enhanced binding and invasion of host cells leading to higher infectivity. Leishmanial cyclophilin also mediates trialysin protection and metabolic stimulation by T. cruzi, indicating that extracellular cyclophilin may be critical to adaptation in other insect-borne protozoa. This work demonstrates that cyclophilin serves as molecular sensor leading to the evasion and adaptive metabolic response to insect defense peptides. © 2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - Background-: Very few studies have measured disease penetrance and prognostic factors of Chagas cardiomyopathy among asymptomatic Trypanosoma cruzi-infected persons. Methods and Results-: We performed a retrospective cohort study among initially healthy blood donors with an index T cruzi-seropositive donation and age-, sex-, and period-matched seronegatives in 1996 to 2002 in the Brazilian cities of São Paulo and Montes Claros. In 2008 to 2010, all subjects underwent medical history, physical examination, ECGs, and echocardiograms. ECG and echocardiogram results were classified by blinded core laboratories, and records with abnormal results were reviewed by a blinded panel of 3 cardiologists who adjudicated the outcome of Chagas cardiomyopathy. Associations with Chagas cardiomyopathy were tested with multivariate logistic regression. Mean follow-up time between index donation and outcome assessment was 10.5 years for the seropositives and 11.1 years for the seronegatives. Among 499 T cruzi seropositives, 120 (24%) had definite Chagas cardiomyopathy, and among 488 T cruzi seronegatives, 24 (5%) had cardiomyopathy, for an incidence difference of 1.85 per 100 person-years attributable to T cruzi infection. Of the 120 seropositives classified as having Chagas cardiomyopathy, only 31 (26%) presented with ejection fraction <50%, and only 11 (9%) were classified as New York Heart Association class II or higher. Chagas cardiomyopathy was associated (P<0.01) with male sex, a history of abnormal ECG, and the presence of an S3 heart sound. Conclusions-: There is a substantial annual incidence of Chagas cardiomyopathy among initially asymptomatic T cruzi-seropositive blood donors, although disease was mild at diagnosis. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - The analysis of promastigote excreted-secreted antigen (ESA) reactivity with 53 visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases showed that each sample reacted regardless of the antigen or the Leishmania species used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) displayed 100% positivity with the L. (L.) chagasi ESA-blot recognizing bands of molecular weight ranging from 26.5 to 31.5 kDa. The analysis of 160 non-visceral cases showed that 5% of the samples cross-reacted with the L. (L.) chagasi ESA-ELISA and 9.4% reacted with the ESA isolated from L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (V.) braziliensis, whereas a high cross-reaction ranging from 24.4% to 25% was observed with total crude promastigote antigens (PRO-ELISA). The ESA-blot of L. (L.) chagasi tested with non-visceral sera samples showed a cross-reaction with 8.8% of cases; most of these cases represented tegumentary leishmaniasis and only one acute chagasic case. These data lead us to recommend the use of ESA as an alternative antigen in VL diagnosis. Copyright © 2013 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is an important cause of morbidity and mortality primarily resulting from cardiac dysfunction, although T. cruzi infection results in inflammation and cell destruction in many organs. We found that T. cruzi (Brazil strain) infection of mice results in pancreatic inflammation and parasitism within pancreatic β-cells with apparent sparing of α cells and leads to the disruption of pancreatic islet architecture, β-cell dysfunction, and surprisingly, hypoglycemia. Blood glucose and insulin levels were reduced in infected mice during acute infection and insulin levels remained low into the chronic phase. In response to the hypoglycemia, glucagon levels 30 days postinfection were elevated, indicating normal α-cell function. Administration of L-arginine and a β-adrenergic receptor agonist (CL316, 243, respectively) resulted in a diminished insulin response during the acute and chronic phases. Insulin granules were docked, but the lack of insulin secretion suggested an inability of granules to fuse at the plasma membrane of pancreatic β-cells. In the liver, there was a concomitant reduced expression of glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA and glucose production from pyruvate (pyruvate tolerance test), demonstrating defective hepatic gluconeogenesis as a cause for the T. cruzi-induced hypoglycemia, despite reduced insulin, but elevated glucagon levels. The data establishes a complex, multi-tissue relationship between T. cruzi infection, Chagas disease, and host glucose homeostasis. Copyright © 2013 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

AB  - The molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Brazil is complex and heterogeneous because several subtypes co-circulate with some important regional differences. This study evaluated HIV-1 subtypes amongst pregnant women living in the metropolitan area and in the interior cities from central western Brazil. From June 2008 to June 2010, 86.9% of confirmed cases of HIV-1 infection amongst pregnant women (172 out of 198 cases) were recruited in Goiania/Goias state. The HIV-1 pol gene was sequenced after nested-PCR. HIV-1 subtypes were assigned by REGA, phylogenetic, and bootscan analyses. The median age of participants was 26 years (15-41 years range); 58.7% of participants were diagnosed during prenatal care and 51.7% of participants came from >50 interior cities within Goias state. Amongst the 131 HIV-1 pol sequences, 64.9% were subtype B, 13.0% were BF1 recombinant, 11.4% were subtype C, 7.6% were subtype F1, and 2.3% were BC recombinant. According to the HIV-1 diagnosis date (1994-2010), a significant increase in subtype C and a decrease of BF1 mosaics were observed over time. All subtype C patients lived in interior cities where the highest prevalence of subtype C outside southern Brazil was observed (18.4%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple independent introductions of the Brazilian subtype C clade from the southern/southeastern regions of Brazil. The HIV-1 epidemic in women from central western Brazil infected by the heterosexual route is characterized by an unexpectedly high prevalence of subtype C viruses highly related to those circulating in southern/southeastern Brazil. These findings highlight the importance of molecular surveillance programs outside large metropolitan regions in Brazil. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - An α-carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) has been identified, cloned, and characterized from the unicellular protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The enzyme (TcCA) has a very high catalytic activity for the CO2 hydration reaction, being similar kinetically to the human (h) isoform hCA II, although it is devoid of the His64 proton shuttle. A large number of aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides and some 5-mercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazoles were investigated as TcCA inhibitors. The aromatic sulfonamides were weak inhibitors (KI values of 192 nM to 84 μM), whereas some heterocyclic compounds inhibited the enzyme with KI values in the range 61.6-93.6 nM. The thiols were the most potent in vitro inhibitors (KI values of 21.1-79.0 nM), and some of them also inhibited the epimastigotes growth of two T. cruzi strains in vivo. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The congenital transmission of Chagas disease is associated with an increase in parasitemia during pregnancy, maternal and fetal immunity, and populations of Trypanosoma cruzi. In this study, the biological behavior of TcI and TcV (isolated from a human congenital case) strains and their potential for experimental congenital transmission were evaluated in female BALB/C mice. Parasitemia was estimated by fresh blood examination, semiquantitative microhematocrit, and hemoculture, while congenital transmission was evaluated by culture in the liver infusion tryptose medium and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the pups' tissues on postnatal day 7 and of the pups' blood sample at 30 days after birth. Infection was detected in 100 % of the females. Both strains showed subpatent parasitemia, which was higher for TcV infection. The presence of amastigote nest was detected only in an animal infected with TcI. The inflammatory process was more frequent (p = 0.001) in the tissues of the animals infected with TcV (58.6 %) than TcI (31.1 %). The fertility rates of females mated after 35 days postinfection were similar (90 % for TcV, 88.9 % for TcI; p = 0.938). Parasitemia did not change during pregnancy. The average number of pups/female was greater (p = 0.03) in mice with TcV infection (8.30) than in those with TcI infection (4.78). Congenital transmission was detected exclusively by PCR in 50.9 % of the pups, 46.6 % for TcV and 58.1 % for TcI. The PCR positivity for TcI was higher in the blood than in the tissue (p = 0.003). These results demonstrate the T. cruzi experimental congenital infection associated with subpatent maternal parasitemia of TcI and TcV. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Chagas disease is a Trypanosoma cruzi-induced zoonosis that has no natural cure. Local damage induced by the parasite and the immune response causes chronic heart and digestive lesions. Efforts to develop a therapeutic vaccine that boosts the immune response to completely clear the parasite are needed because there is no effective treatment for chronically infected patients. In an attempt to modify the host-parasite equilibrium to increase parasite destruction, we analyzed cardiopathy and the immune response in chronically infected mice that were challenged with live homologous parasites. Challenge with a single dose of parasite increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations, gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production, and serum-specific IgG levels. However, subpatent parasitemias and cardiac tissue were not affected. Because of the short duration of the immune boost after a single challenge, we next evaluated the impact of four parasite doses, administered 3 weeks apart. At 1 to 2 months after the last dose, the numbers of CD4 + T cells and IFN-γ-producing CD4+ memory cells and the CD4+ T cell proliferative response to T. cruzi antigen were increased in the spleen. The frequency of IFN-γ-producing CD8+ memory cells in the blood was also increased. However, the sustained challenge did not favor TH1 development; rather, it induced an increase in serum-specific IgG1 levels and mixed TH1/TH2 cytokine production. Moreover, there were no significant changes in cardiac lesions and subpatent parasitemias. In conclusion, we believe that this study may help in elucidating the necessary elements for a successful therapeutic vaccine which may reduce cardiomyopathy in chronically infected human patients.

AB  - Microorganisms use specialized systems to export virulence factors into host cells. Secretion of effector proteins into the extracellular environment has been described in Trypanosoma cruzi; however, a comprehensive proteomic analysis of the secretome and the secretion mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here, we present evidence that T. cruzi releases proteins associated with vesicles that are formed by at least two different mechanisms. Transmission electron microscopy showed larger vesicles budding from the plasma membrane of noninfective epimastigotes and infective metacyclic trypomastigotes, as well as smaller vesicles within the flagellar pocket of both forms. Parasite conditioned culture supernatant was fractionated and characterized by morphological, immunochemical, and proteomic analyses. Three fractions were obtained by differential ultracentrifugation: the first enriched in larger vesicles resembling ectosomes, the second enriched in smaller vesicles resembling exosomes, and a third fraction enriched in soluble proteins not associated with extracellular vesicles. Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis revealed a rich collection of proteins involved in metabolism, signaling, nucleic acid binding, and parasite survival and virulence. These findings support the notion that T. cruzi uses different secretion pathways to excrete/secrete proteins. Moreover, our results suggest that metacyclic forms may use extracellular vesicles to deliver cargo into host cells. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Chagas' disease is one of the most serious parasitic diseases of Latin America, with a social and economic impact far outweighing the combined effects of other parasitic diseases such as malaria, leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis. In the chronic phase of this disease, the destruction of enteric nervous system (ENS) components leads to megacolon development. Previous data presented that the regeneration tax in the ENS neurons is augmented in chagasic patients. Although, there are several neuronal types with different functions in the intestine a detailed study about the regeneration of every neuronal type was never performed before. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the regeneration tax of every neuronal cell type in the ENS from chagasic patients with megacolon and non-infected individuals. A neuronal regeneration marker (GAP-43) was used in combination with a pan-neuronal marker (Peripherin) and several neuropeptides markers (cChat, Substance P, NPY, VIP and NOS), and it was considered as positive just with the combination of these markers. Our results demonstrated that the regeneration levels of cChat, Substance P, and NPY were similar in chagasic patients and non-infected individuals. However, levels of VIP and NOS neuropeptides were increased in chagasic patients when compared with non-infected individuals. We believe that the augment in the regeneration occur due to an increased destruction of selective neuronal types. These results corroborates with previous studies that pointed out to selective destruction of VIP and NOS neurons in chagasic patients. © 2012 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.

AB  - Triatoma virus (TrV) is a small, non-enveloped virus that has a+ssRNA genome and is currently classified under the Cripavirus genus of the Dicistroviridae family. TrV infects haematophagous triatomine insects (Hemiptera: Reduviidae), which are vectors of American trypanosomosis (Chagas disease). TrV can be transmitted through the horizontal faecal-oral route, and causes either deleterious sublethal effects or even the death of laboratory insect colonies. Various species of triatomines from different regions of Latin America are currently being reared in research laboratories, with little or no awareness of the presence of TrV; therefore, any biological conclusion drawn from experiments on insects infected with this virus is inherently affected by the side effects of its infection. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to estimate the sample size required for detecting a TrV infection. We applied this model to screen the infection in the faeces of triatomines belonging to insectaries from 13 Latin American countries, carrying out the identification of TrV by using RT-PCR. TrV was detected in samples coming from Argentina, which is where the virus was first isolated from Triatoma infestans (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) several years ago. Interestingly, several colonies from Brazil were also found infected with the virus. This positive result widens the TrV's host range to a total of 14 triatomine species. Our findings suggest that many triatomine species distributed over a large region of South America may be naturally infected with TrV. Copyright © Published by icipe 2013.

AB  - Continued assessment of temporal trends in mortality and epidemiology of specific heart failure in South America is needed to provide a scientific basis for rational allocation of the limited health care resources, and strategies to reduce risk and predict the future burden of heart failure. The epidemiology of heart failure in South America was reviewed. Heart failure is the main cause of hospitalization based on available data from approximately 50% of the South American population. The main etiologies of heart failure are ischemic, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, valvular, hypertensive and chagasic etiologies. In endemic areas, Chagas heart disease may be responsible by 41% of the HF cases. Also, heart failure presents high mortality especially in patients with Chagas etiology. Heart failure and etiologies associated with heart failure may be responsible for 6.3% of causes of deaths. Rheumatic fever is the leading cause of valvular heart disease. However, a tendency to reduction of HF mortality due to Chagas heart disease from 1985 to 2006, and reduction in mortality due to HF from 1999 to 2005 were observed in selected states in Brazil. The findings have important public health implications because the allocation of health care resources, and strategies to reduce risk of heart failure should also consider the control of neglected Chagas disease and rheumatic fever in South American countries. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - In Brazil, the percentage of infected dogs living in areas where canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is endemic ranges from 10 to 62%; however, the prevalence of infection in dogs is probably higher than figures reported from serological studies. In addition, problems with the occurrence of false-positive or false-negative results in the serodiagnosis of CVL have been reported. The present work analyzed the potential of synthetic peptides mapped from hypothetical proteins for improvement of the serodiagnosis of Leishmania infantum infection in dogs. From 26 identified leishmanial proteins, eight were selected, considering that no homologies between these proteins and others from trypanosomatide sequence databases were encountered. The sequences of these proteins were mapped to identify linear B-cell epitopes, and 17 peptides were synthesized and tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the serodiagnosis of L. infantum infection in dogs. Of these, three exhibited sensitivity and specificity values higher than 75% and 90%, respectively, to differentiate L. infantum-infected animals from Trypanosoma cruziinfected animals and healthy animals. Soluble Leishmania antigen (SLA) showed poor sensitivity (4%) and specificity (36%) to differentiate L. infantum-infected dogs from healthy and T. cruzi-infected dogs. Lastly, the three selected peptides were combined in different mixtures and higher sensitivity and specificity values were obtained, even when sera from T. cruzi-infected dogs were used. The study's findings suggest that these three peptides can constitute a potential tool for more sensitive and specific serodiagnosis of L. infantum infection in dogs.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi infection, is a leading cause of heart failure in Latin American countries. In a previous study, we showed beneficial effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration in the heart function of mice with chronic T. cruzi infection. Presently, we investigated the mechanisms by which this cytokine exerts its beneficial effects. Mice chronically infected with T. cruzi were treated with human recombinant G-CSF (3 courses of 200 g/kg/d for 5 d). Inflammation and fibrosis were reduced in the hearts of G-CSFtreated mice, compared with the hearts of vehicle-treated mice, which correlated with decreased syndecan-4, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and galectin-3 expressions. Marked reductions in interferon and tumor necrosis factor and increased interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor- were found after G-CSF administration. Because the therapy did not induce a Th1 to Th2 immune response deviation, we investigated the role of regulatory T (Treg) cells. A significant increase in CD3Foxp3 cells was observed in the hearts of GCSF- treated mice. In addition, a reduction of parasitism was observed after G-CSF treatment. Our results indicate a role of Treg cells in the immunosuppression induced by G-CSF treatment and reinforces its potential therapeutic use for patients with Chagas disease.- Vasconcelos, J.

AB  - The Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) is an independent global programme of scientific collaboration cosponsored by the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Development Program, the World Bank, and the World Health Organization. TDR's strategy is based on stewardship for research on infectious diseases of poverty, empowerment of endemic countries, research on neglected priority needs, and the promotion of scientific collaboration influencing global efforts to combat major tropical diseases. In 2001, in view of the achievements obtained in the reduction of transmission of Chagas disease through the Southern Cone Initiative and the improvement in Chagas disease control activities in some countries of the Andean and the Central American Initiatives, TDR transferred the Chagas Disease Implementation Research Programme (CIRP) to the Communicable Diseases Unit of the Pan American Health Organization (CD/PAHO).This paper presents a scientometric evaluation of the 73 projects from 18 Latin American and European countries that were granted by CIRP/PAHO/TDR between 1997 and 2007. We analyzed all final reports of the funded projects and scientific publications, technical reports, and human resource training activities derived from them. Results about the number of projects funded, countries and institutions involved, gender analysis, number of published papers in indexed scientific journals, main topics funded, patents inscribed, and triatomine species studied are presented and discussed.The results indicate that CIRP/PAHO/TDR initiative has contributed significantly, over the 1997-2007 period, to Chagas disease knowledge as well as to the individual and institutional-building capacity. © 2013 Carbajal-de-la-Fuente, Yadon.

AB  - Hydroxymethylnitrofurazone (NFOH) is a trypanocidal prodrug of nitrofurazone (NF), devoid of mutagenic toxicity. The purpose of this work was to study the chemical conversion of NFOH into NF in sodium acetate buffer (pH 1.2 and 7.4) and in human plasma and to determine preclinical pharmacokinetic parameters in rats. At pH 1.2, the NFOH was totally transformed into NF, the parent drug, after 48 h, while at pH 7.4, after the same period, the hydrolysis rate was 20%. In human plasma, 50% of NFOH was hydrolyzed after 24 h. In the investigation of kinetic disposition, the concentration of drug in serum versus time curve was used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters after a single-dose regimen. NFOH showed a time to maximum concentration of drug in serum (Tmax) as 1 h, suggesting faster absorption than NF (4 h). The most important results observed were the volume of distribution (V) of NFOH through the tissues, which showed a rate that is 20-fold higher (337.5 liters/kg of body weight) than that of NF (17.64 liters/kg), and the concentration of NF obtained by in vivo metabolism of NFOH, which was about four times lower (maximum concentration of drug in serum [Cmax]=0.83 μg/ml; area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h [AUC0-12]=5.683 μg/ml · h) than observed for administered NF (Cmax=2.78 μg/ml; AUC0-12=54.49 μg/ml · h). These findings can explain the superior activity and lower toxicity of the prodrug NFOH in relation to its parent drug and confirm NFOH as a promising anti-Chagas' disease drug candidate.

AB  - Background: Chagas' disease is one of the leading causes of heart failure in Latin American countries. Despite its great social impact, there is no direct evidence in the literature explaining the development of heart failure in Chagas' disease. Therefore, the main objective of the study was to investigate the development of the Chagas' disease towards its chronic phase and correlate with modifications in the cellular electrophysiological characteristics of the infected heart. Methods and results: Using a murine model of Chagas' disease, we confirmed and extended previous findings of altered electrocardiogram and echocardiogram in this cardiomyopathy. The observed changes in the electrocardiogram were correlated with the prolonged action potential and reduced transient outward potassium current density. Reduced heart function was associated with remodeling of intracellular calcium handling, altered extracellular matrix content, and to a set of proteins involved in the control of cellular contractility in ventricular myocytes. Furthermore, disruption of calcium homeostasis was partially due to activation of the PI3Kinase/nitric oxide signaling pathway. Finally, we propose a causal link between the inflammatory mediators and heart remodeling during chagasic cardiomyopathy. Conclusion: Altogether our results demonstrate that heart failure in Chagas' disease may occur due to electrical and mechanical remodeling of cardiac myocytes, and suggest that AKT/PI3K/NO axis could be an important pharmacological target to improve the disease outcome. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Interaction between Chagas disease vectors and man is continuous in vulnerable dwellings, in which the vectors feed on man and find conditions for reproduction. This study explores factors that affect the choice of home construction methods in a rural community in Brazil, emphasizing the rationale for the persistence of dwelling vulnerability. Information on local resident perspectives regarding safety and home construction methods was gathered through domiciliary interviews with open questionnaires. The study revealed a large proportion of vulnerable mud huts, with others under construction. Insecurity over land tenure inhibits the construction of definitive houses. Mud homes are associated with greater structural stability. Cultural and economic factors have clearly been linked to the choice of method for home construction. The economic evolution of family conflicts with traditional aspects as well as the relative increased cost of the materials needed for mud house construction has not completely inhibited building with mud.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiological characteristics of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected mothers and the live birth conditions of neonates. Methods: A serological survey with IgG-specific tests was conducted using dried blood samples from newborn infants in the State of Minas Gerais. T. cruzi infection was confirmed in mothers through positive serology in two different tests, and infected mothers were required to have their infants serologically tested after the age of 6 months. The birth conditions of the neonates were obtained from the System of Information on Live Births database. Results: The study included 407 children born to T. cruzi-infected mothers and 407 children born to uninfected mothers. The average age of seropositive mothers was 32 years (CI95% 31.3-32.6), which was greater than the average age of seronegative mothers - 25 years (CI95% 24.8-25.2). The mothers' level of education was higher among uninfected mothers (41% had 8 or more years of education, versus 22% between the infected mothers). Vaginal delivery was more frequent among infected mothers. There was no evidence of inter-group differences with respect to the child's sex, gestational age, birth weight or Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity and respiration (APGAR) scores at 1 and 5 minutes. Conclusions: The level of education and the greater number of previous pregnancies and cases of vaginal delivery reflect the lower socioeconomical conditions of the infected mothers. In the absence of vertical transmission, neonates had similar health status irrespective of the infection status of their mothers.

AB  - The presence of acute Chagas disease (ACD) due to oral transmission is growing and expanding in several South American countries. Within the Amazon basin, the Abaetetuba municipality has been a site of recurrent cases spanning across distinct landscapes. Because Chagas disease is primarily a zoonotic infection, we compared the enzootic Trypanosoma cruzi transmission cycles in three different environmental areas of Abaetetuba to better understand this new epidemiological situation. Philander opossum was the most abundant mammalian species collected (38% of the collected mammals) with a T. cruzi prevalence of 57%, as determined by hemocultures. Didelphis marsupialis was abundant only in the area with the higher level of environmental disturbance (approximately 42%) and did not yield detectable parasitemia. Despite similarities observed in the composition of the small mammalian fauna and the prevalence of T. cruzi infection among the studied areas, the potential of these hosts to infect vectors differed significantly according to the degree of land use (with prevalences of 5%, 41%, and 64% in areas A3, A1 and A2, respectively). Domestic mammals were also found to be infected, and one canine T. cruzi isolate was obtained. Our data demonstrated that the transmission of T. cruzi in the Amazon basin is far more complex than had been previously taught and showed that the probability of humans and domestic mammals coming into contact with infected bugs can vary dramatically, even within the same municipality. The exposure of dogs to T. cruzi infection (indicated by positive serology) was the common feature among the studied localities, stressing the importance of selecting domestic mammals as sentinels in the identification of T. cruzi transmission hotspots. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We modified the thiazolidinic ring at positions N3, C4, and C5, yielding compounds 6-24. Compounds with a phenyl at position N3, 15-19, 22-24, exhibited better inhibitory properties for cruzain and against the parasite than 2-iminothiazolidin-4-one 5. We were able to identify one high-efficacy trypanocidal compound, 2-minothiazolidin-4-one 18, which inhibited the activity of cruzain and the proliferation of epimastigotes and was cidal for trypomastigotes but was not toxic for splenocytes. Having located some of the structural determinants of the trypanocidal properties, we subsequently wished to determine if the exchange of the thiazolidine for a thiazole ring leaves the functional properties unaffected. We therefore tested thiazoles 26-45 and observed that they did not inhibit cruzain, but they exhibited trypanocidal effects. Parasite development was severely impaired when treated with 18, thus reinforcing the notion that this class of heterocycles can lead to useful cidal agents for Chagas disease. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Phytotherapy consists in all pharmaceutical preparation using certain part of plants as a feedstock with known pharmacological effects for medicinal purposes. In order to a better understanding of the biological effects associated with herbal medicines, many scientific studies have been conducted and developed in recent years. Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi (Aroeira) is native from Peru and is also found in Europe, Asia and some Latin American countries. This herbal remedy was chosen for study because of its wide use and interesting pharmacological actions. Among the effects documented in the literature, they are a potent antimicrobial agent. Its use as hydroalcoholic extract showed positive effect on cystotomy healing in rats and the studies indicate that Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi vaginal gel is effective and safe for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. The experimental model discussed in this study was the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) in different strains of protozoa. Evaluation of the effects of the extract with Trypanosomacruzi and Leishmaniaamazonensis strains was conducted at different concentrations of a dilution series to allow a more sensitive analysis, in a wide concentration range. A static or toxic action can be distinguished by the color reaction which is involved rezazorina. The results indicate that in none of the tested strains were observed cytotoxic effects of aqueous extract. There was also no inhibitory action on the development of tested strains. ©2012 Science Publication.

AB  - Solid dispersions (SDs) are an approach to increasing the water solubility and bioavailability of lipophilic drugs such as ursolic acid (UA), a triterpenoid with trypanocidal activity. In this work, Gelucire 50/13, a surfactant compound with permeability-enhancing properties, and silicon dioxide, a drying adjuvant, were employed to produce SDs with UA. SDs and physical mixtures (PMs) in different drug/carrier ratios were characterized and compared using differential scanning calorimetry, hot stage microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), particle size, water solubility values, and dissolution profiles. Moreover, LLC-MK2 fibroblast cytotoxicity and trypanocidal activity evaluation were performed to determine the potential of SD as a strategy to improve UA efficacy against Chagas disease. The results demonstrated the conversion of UA from the crystalline to the amorphous state through XRD. FTIR experiments provided evidence of intermolecular interactions among the drug and carriers through carbonyl peak broadening in the SDs. These findings helped explain the enhancement of water solubility from 75.98 μg/mL in PMs to 293.43 μg/mL in SDs and the faster drug release into aqueous media compared with pure UA or PMs, which was maintained after 6 months at room temperature. Importantly, improved SD dissolution was accompanied by higher UA activity against trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, but not against mammalian fibroblasts, enhancing the potential of UA for Chagas disease treatment. © 2012 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.

AB  - Parasites of the genus Trypanosoma are common in bats and those of the subgenus Schizotrypanum are restricted to bats throughout the world, with the exception of Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) cruzi that also infects other mammals and is restricted to the American Continent. We have characterized trypanosome isolates from Molossidae bats captured in Mozambique, Africa. Morphology and behaviour in culture, supported by phylogenetic inferences using SSU (small subunit) rRNA, gGAPDH (glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and Cyt b (cytochrome b) genes, allowed to classify the isolates as a new Schizotrypanum species named Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) erneyi sp. nov. This is the first report of a Schizotrypanum species from African bats cultured, characterized morphologically and biologically, and positioned in phylogenetic trees. The unprecedented finding of a new species of the subgenus Schizotrypanum from Africa that is closest related to the America-restricted Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) cruzi marinkellei and T. cruzi provides new insights into the origin and evolutionary history of T. cruzi and closely related bat trypanosomes. Altogether, data from our study support the hypothesis of an ancestor trypanosome parasite of bats evolving to infect other mammals, even humans, and adapted to transmission by triatomine bugs in the evolutionary history of T. cruzi in the New World. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The role of Azadirachta indica (neem) against Chagas disease and its antibiotic and antidiabetic action have been demonstrated in non-pregnant animals. However, the effects of neem on lipid metabolism and oxidative stress during pregnancy remain to be investigated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Azadirachta indica (neem) on maternal reproductive performance and biochemical parameters in non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced mild diabetic rats (MD). Materials and methods: Pregnant rats were randomly distributed into six experimental groups: ND=non-treated non-diabetic (n=13); NDOil=non-diabetic treated with 1.2 mL/day neem seed oil (n=12); NDPA=non-diabetic treated with 1.0 mg/mL/day azadirachtin (n=12); D=non-treated diabetic (n=13); DOil: diabetic treated with neem seed oil (n=12), and DPA=diabetic treated with azadirachtin, n=13. Treatment with either neem oil (1.2 mL/day) or azadirachtin (1.0 mg/mL/day) was orally administered throughout pregnancy. Glucose test tolerance (GTT) was performed at day 17 of pregnancy and used as an inclusion criterion. At term pregnancy, maternal reproductive outcomes, lipid profile and oxidative stress status were assessed. Results: Treatment with neem oil and azadirachtin during pregnancy (1) had no hypoglycemic and anti-hyperglycemic effects on non-diabetic and diabetic rats, respectively; (2) affected OGTT glycemic levels in diabetic rats; (3) increased the proportion of fetuses classified as small for pregnancy age (SPA) in all groups; and (4) did not interfere with the lipid profile in non-diabetic dams. Neem oil reduced the rate of total cholesterol and NEFA in diabetic animals. Both neem oil and azadirachtin increased lipoperoxidation, characterized by increased MDA levels in non-diabetic rats. Conclusion: Both neem seed oil and azadirachtin impaired intrauterine development and altered antioxidant/oxidative status during pregnancy. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fogo Selvagem (FS) is an autoimmune bullous disease with pathogenic IgG autoantibodies recognizing desmoglein 1 (Dsg1), a desmosomal glycoprotein. In certain settlements of Brazil, a high prevalence of FS (3%) is reported, suggesting environmental factors as triggers of the autoimmune response. Healthy individuals from endemic areas recognize nonpathogenic epitopes of Dsg1, and exposure to hematophagous insects is a risk factor for FS. Fogo selvagem and Chagas disease share some geographic sites, and anti-Dsg1 has been detected in Chagas patients. Indeterminate Chagas disease was identified in a Brazilian Amerindian population of high risk for FS. In counterpart, none of the FS patients living in the same geographic region showed reactivity against Trypanosoma cruzi. The profile of anti-Dsg1 antibodies showed positive results in 15 of 40 FS sera and in 33 of 150 sera from healthy individuals from endemic FS sites, and no cross-reactivity between Chagas disease and FS was observed.

AB  - Assessing the efficacy of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) in patients with Chagas' heart disease (ChHD) and identifying the clinical predictors of mortality and ICD shock during long-term follow-up. ChHD is associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmias and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Although ChHD is a common form of cardiomyopathy in Latin American ICD users, little is known about its efficacy in the treatment of this population. The study cohort included 116 consecutive patients with ChHD and an ICD implanted for secondary prevention. Of the 116 patients, 83 (72%) were men; the mean age was 54 ± 10.7 years. Several clinical variables were tested in a multivariate Cox model for predicting long-term mortality. The average follow-up was 45 ± 32 months. New York Heart Association class I-II developed in 83% of patients. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 42 ± 16% at implantation. Of the 116 patients, 58 (50%) had appropriate shocks and 13 (11%) had inappropriate therapy. A total of 31 patients died (7.1% annual mortality rate). New York Heart Association class III (hazard ratio [HR] 3.09, 95% confidence interval 1.37 to 6.96, p = 0.0064) was a predictor of a worse prognosis. The left ventricular ejection fraction (HR 0.972, 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 0.99, p = 0.0442) and low cumulative right ventricular pacing (HR 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.49, p = 0.0001) were predictors of better survival. The left ventricular diastolic diameter was an independent predictor of appropriate shock (HR 1.032, 95% confidence interval 1.004 to 1.060, p = 0.025). In conclusion, in a long-term follow-up, ICD efficacy for secondary sudden cardiac death prevention in patients with ChHD was marked by a favorable annual rate of all-cause mortality (7.1%); 50% of the cohort received appropriate shock therapy. New York Heart Association class III and left ventricular ejection fraction were independent predictors of worse prognosis, and low cumulative right ventricular pacing defined better survival. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi, remains a challenging infection due to the unavailability of safe and efficacious drugs. Inhibitors of the trypanosome sterol 14α-demethylase enzyme (CYP51), including azole antifungal drugs, are promising candidates for development as anti-Chagas disease drugs. Posaconazole is under clinical investigation for Chagas disease, although the high cost of this drug may limit its widespread use. We have previously reported that the human protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) inhibitor tipifarnib has potent anti-T. cruzi activity by inhibiting the CYP51 enzyme. Furthermore, we have developed analogs that minimize the PFT-inhibitory activity and enhance the CYP51 inhibition. In this paper, we describe the efficacy of the lead tipifarnib analog compared to that of posaconazole in a murine model of T. cruzi infection. The plasma exposure profiles for each compound following a single oral dose in mice and estimated exposure parameters after repeated twice-daily dosing for 20 days are also presented. The lead tipifarnib analog had potent suppressive activity on parasitemia in mice but was unsuccessful at curing mice, whereas posaconazole as well as benznidazole cured 3 of 5 and 4 of 6 mice, respectively. The efficacy results are consistent with posaconazole having substantially higher predicted exposure than that of the tipifarnib analog after repeat twice-daily administration. Further changes to the tipifarnib analogs to reduce plasma clearance are therefore likely to be important. A crystal structure of a trypanosomal CYP51 bound to a tipifarnib analog is reported here and provides new insights to guide structure-based drug design for further optimized compounds.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the histopathological alterations of the placenta provoked by maternal infection during pregnancy by different Trypanosoma cruzi strains. Pregnant mice, 60 day-old, were i.p. inoculated with 2 × 105 bloodstream trypomastigotes of colombian, Y, Bolivia or RC strains of T. cruzi. The results demonstrated that the Bolivia and RC strains showed higher histotropism for the mouse placental cells than the colombian or Y strains. The inflammatory process in all the infected groups involved the basal decidua, but the colombian strain caused intense decidual degeneration, with rare or absent inflammatory cells. Placentas from all the infected groups displayed aéreas of edema, degeneration, necrosis and calcification, mainly in the basal decidua, but the group infected by the RC strain showed also involvement of the spongiotrophoblast. The highest parasitism was observed with the Bolivia and RC strains, involving all the placenta zones, including the trophoblast giant cells and the spongiotrophoblast. The results show that placentas undergo differentiated pathological processes, characteristic for each strain.

AB  - We performed a critical study of conventional serology, followed by supplementary serological, parasitological, and molecular tests, to assess the response to etiologic treatment of Chagas' disease. A group of 94 Chagas' disease patients treated with benznidazole at least 10 years earlier were evaluated from the laboratory and clinical points of view. When conventional serology (enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], indirect immunofluorescence [IIF], and indirect hemagglutination [IHA]) and classic criteria (consistent results with any two of the three tests) or more rigorous criteria (consistent results from the three tests) were used, 10.6% and 8.5% of patients were considered treated and cured (TC) by classic and rigorous criteria, respectively. Patients were then evaluated using supplementary (recombinant ELISA and Trypanosoma cruzi excreted-secreted antigen blotting [TESA-blot]), parasitological (hemoculture), and molecular (PCR) tests. The results of recombinant ELISA were similar to those with the rigorous criterion (three consistent test results). The TESA-blot group showed a higher percentage (21.3%) of negative results than the groups defined by either cure criterion. Hemoculture and PCR gave negative results for all treated and cured (TC) patients, regardless of the criterion used. Recombinant ELISA and TESA-blot tests showed negative results for 70% and 87.5% of the patients categorized as TC by the classic and three-test criteria, respectively. For patients with discordant conventional serology, the supplementary serological and molecular tests were the decisive factor in determining therapeutic failure. Clinical evaluation showed that 62.5% of TC patients presented with the indeterminate form of the disease. Additionally, treated patients with negative TESA-blot results should be reevaluated later with all methodologies used here to verify whether TESAblot is a reliable way to determine early parasitological cure of Chagas' disease.

AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), an X-linked recessive disorder affecting 1 in 3500 males, is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. DMD leads to degeneration of skeletal and cardiac muscles and to chronic inflammation. The mdx/mdx mouse has been widely used to study DMD; this model mimics most characteristics of the disease, including low numbers of T cells in damaged muscles. In this study, we aimed to assess migration of T cells to the heart and to identify any alterations in adhesion molecules that could possibly modulate this process. In 6-week-old mdx/mdx mice, blood leukocytes, including T cells, were CD62L+, but by 12 weeks of age down-modulation was evident, with only approximately 40% of T cells retaining this molecule. Our in vitro and in vivo results point to a P2X7-dependent shedding of CD62L (with high levels in the serum), which in 12-week-old mdx/mdx mice reduces blood T cell competence to adhere to cardiac vessels in vitro and to reach cardiac tissue in vivo, even after Trypanosoma cruzi infection, a known inducer of lymphoid myocarditis. In mdx/mdx mice treated with Brilliant Blue G, a P2X7 blocker, these blood lymphocytes retained CD62L and were capable of migrating to the heart. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of inflammatory infiltration and immune regulation in DMD. © 2012 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

AB  - Background Autoantibodies directed against specific neuronal antigens are found in a significant number of patients with gastrointestinal neuromuscular diseases (GINMDs) secondary to neoplasia. This study examined the presence of antineuronal antibodies in idiopathic GINMD and GINMD secondary to South American Trypanosomiasis. The GI distribution of voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs) was also investigated. Methods Seventy-three patients were included in the study with diagnoses of primary achalasia, enteric dysmotility, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, esophageal or colonic dysmotility secondary to Chagas' disease. Sera were screened for specific antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase, voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs; P/Q subtype), nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs; α3 subtype), and voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs, KV1 subtype) using validated immunoprecipitation assays. The distribution of six VGKC subunits (KV1.1-1.6), including those known to be antigenic targets of anti-VGKC antibodies was immunohistochemically investigated in all main human GI tract regions. Key Results Three patients (14%) with chagasic GI dysmotility were found to have positive anti-VGKC antibody titers. No antibodies were detected in patients with idiopathic GINMD. The VGKCs were found in enteric neurons at every level of the gut in unique yet overlapping distributions. The VGKC expression in GI smooth muscle was found to be limited to the esophagus. Conclusions &amp; Inferences A small proportion of patients with GI dysfunction secondary to Chagas' disease have antibodies against VGKCs. The presence of these channels in the human enteric nervous system may have pathological relevance to the growing number of GINMDs with which anti-VGKC antibodies have been associated. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored mucins of Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes play an important immunomodulatory role during the course of Chagas disease. Here, some biological activities of tGPI-mucins from four T. cruzi isolates, including benznidazole-susceptible (BZS-Y), benznidazole- resistant (BZR-Y), CL, and Colombiana, were evaluated. GPI-mucins were able to differentially trigger the production of interleukin-12 and nitric oxide in BALB/c macrophages and modulate LLC-MK2 cell invasion. The significance of these variations was assessed after analysis of the terminal α-galactosyl residues. Enzymatic treatment with α-galactosidase indicated a differential expression of O-linked α-galactosyl residues among the strains, with higher expression of this sugar in BZS-Y and BZR-Y T. cruzi populations followed by Colombiana and CL. Unweighted pair group method analysis of the carbohydrate anchor profile and biological parameters allowed the clustering of two groups. One group includes Y and CL strains (T. cruzi II and VI), and the other group is represented by Colombiana strain (T. cruzi I).

AB  - Triatoma infestans and Panstrongylus megistus are relevant Chagas disease vectors. An apparent segregation among these triatomine species inside human households was suggested to rely on mutual repellence between them. However, P. megistus and T. infestans show aggregation responses to chemical signals emitted by the other species. These findings do not rule out the possibility that stimuli other than chemical signals could mediate repellence when these species exploit shelters simultaneously. In the present study, we investigated how P. megistus and T. infestans exploit shelters in controlled laboratory conditions and how insect density and environmental illumination modulate this behavior. We evaluated whether these species aggregate inside shelters or mutually repel each other. Panstrongylus megistus and T. infestans show specific patterns of shelter exploitation, which are differentially affected by insect density and environment illumination. In particular, P. megistus is more sensitive to insect density than T. infestans, whereas T. infestans shows higher sensitivity to illumination than P. megistus. Nevertheless, these species exploit shelters randomly without any apparent repellence. Copyright © 2012 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB  - Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi induces inflammation, which limits parasite proliferation but may result in chagasic heart disease. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2) is a regulator of immune responses and may therefore participate in the pathogenesis of T. cruzi infection. SOCS2 is expressed during T. cruzi infection, and its expression is partially reduced in infected 5-lipoxygenase-deficient [knockout (KO)] mice. In SOCS2 KO mice, there was a reduction in both parasitemia and the expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-6, IL-10, SOCS1, and SOCS3 in the spleen. Expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, SOCS1, and SOCS3 was also reduced in the hearts of infected SOCS2 KO mice. There was an increase in the generation and expansion of T regulatory (Treg) cells and a decrease in the number of memory cells in T. cruzi-infected SOCS2 KO mice. Levels of lipoxinA 4 (LXA 4) increased in these mice. Echocardiography studies demonstrated an impairment of cardiac function in T. cruzi-infected SOCS2 KO mice. There were also changes in calcium handling and in action potential waveforms, and reduced outward potassium currents in isolated cardiac myocytes. Our data suggest that reductions of inflammation and parasitemia in infected SOCS2-deficient mice may be secondary to the increases in Treg cells and LXA 4 levels. This occurs at the cost of greater infection-associated heart dysfunction, highlighting the relevance of balanced inflammatory and immune responses in preventing severe T. cruzi-induced disease.

AB  - Arylimidamides (AIAs) have shown outstanding in vitro potency against intracellular kinetoplastid parasites, and the AIA 2,5-bis[2-(2-propoxy)-4-(2- pyridylimino)aminophenyl]furan dihydrochloride (DB766) displayed good in vivo efficacy in rodent models of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and Chagas' disease. In an attempt to further increase the solubility and in vivo antikinetoplastid potential of DB766, the mesylate salt of this compound and that of the closely related AIA 2,5-bis[2-(2-cyclopentyloxy)-4-(2-pyridylimino)aminophenyl]furan hydrochloride (DB1852) were prepared. These two mesylate salts, designated DB1960 and DB1955, respectively, exhibited dose-dependent activity in the murine model of VL, with DB1960 inhibiting liver parasitemia by 51% at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg/day X 5 and DB1955 reducing liver parasitemia by 57% when given by the same dosing regimen. In a murine Trypanosoma cruzi infection model, DB1960 decreased the peak parasitemia levels that occurred at 8 days postinfection by 46% when given orally at 100 mg/kg/day X 5, while DB1955 had no effect on peak parasitemia levels when administered by the same dosing regimen. Distribution studies revealed that these compounds accumulated to micromolar levels in the liver, spleen, and kidneys but to a lesser extent in the heart, brain, and plasma. A 5-day repeat-dose toxicology study with DB1960 and DB1955 was also conducted with female BALB/c mice, with the compounds administered orally at 100, 200, and 500 mg/kg/day. In the high-dose groups, DB1960 caused changes in serum chemistry, with statistically significant increases in serum blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels, and a 21% decrease in body weight was observed in this group. These changes were consistent with microscopic findings in the livers and kidneys of the treated animals. The incidences of observed clinical signs (hunched posture, tachypnea, tremors, and ruffled fur) were more frequent in DB1960-treated groups than in those treated with DB1955. However, histopathological examination of tissue samples indicated that both compounds had adverse effects at all dose levels. Copyright © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Triatoma matogrossensis is a Hemiptera that belongs to the oliveirai complex, a vector of Chagas' disease that feeds on vertebrate blood in all life stages. Hematophagous insects' salivary glands (SGs) produce potent pharmacologic compounds that counteract host hemostasis, including anticlotting, antiplatelet, and vasodilatory molecules. Exposure to T. matogrossensis was also found to be a risk factor associated with the endemic form of the autoimmune skin disease pemphigus foliaceus, which is described in the same regions where Chagas' disease is observed in Brazil. To obtain a further insight into the salivary biochemical and pharmacologic diversity of this kissing bug and to identify possible allergens that might be associated with this autoimmune disease, a cDNA library from its SGs was randomly sequenced. We present the analysis of a set of 2,230 (SG) cDNA sequences, 1,182 of which coded for proteins of a putative secretory nature.

AB  - A combination of drugs in experimental chemotherapy of Chagas' disease may increase the effectiveness of treatment. To evaluate the possible mechanisms that influence the improvement of therapy, we investigated the pharmacokinetic interaction between benznidazole and itraconazole in a murine model treated orally with single doses of 5 mg of each compound separately or together. Blood samples from treated mice were collected at different intervals for 48 h, and a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-UV method was used to quantify both drugs in the plasma. A decrease of 1.5-fold in the maximum drug concentration in the plasma (Cmax) and an increase of 2.66-fold in the volume of distribution (V) and 7.5-fold in the elimination half-life (t 1/2β) of benznidazole when coadministered with itraconazole were observed. The parameters area under the curve (AUC0-t), area under the curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-∞), time to maximum concentration of drug in serum (Tmax), and clearance (CL) for benznidazole were not significantly different in this therapeutic regime. None of the evaluated parameters for ITC demonstrated a significant difference between isolated and associated administration. These results suggest that the main effect of this interaction leads to accumulation of benznidazole in the biological system. This effect may contribute to the improved therapeutic efficacy of this combination of drugs, in addition to synergism of the different mechanisms of action of benznidazole and itraconazole against Trypanosoma cruzi in vivo.

AB  - Background-Previous studies suggested that transplantation of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMNCs) improves heart function in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy. We report the results of the first randomized trial of BMNC therapy in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy. Methods and Results-Patients 18 to 75 years of age with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association class II to IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <35, and optimized therapy were randomized to intracoronary injection of autologous BMNCs or placebo. The primary end point was the difference in LVEF from baseline to 6 and 12 months after treatment between groups. Analysis was by intention to treat and powered to detect an absolute between-group difference of 5. Between July 2005 and October 2009, 234 patients were enrolled. Two patients abandoned the study and 49 were excluded because of protocol violation. The remaining 183 patients, 93 in the placebo group and 90 in the BMNC group, had a trimmed mean age of 52.4 years (range, 50.8-54.0 years) and LVEF of 26.1 (range, 25.1-27.1) at baseline. Median number of injected BMNCs was 2.20×10 (range, 1.40-3.50×10). Change in LVEF did not differ significantly between treatment groups: trimmed mean change in LVEF at 6 months, 3.0 (1.3-4.8) for BMNCs and 2.5 (0.6-4.5) for placebo (P=0.519); change in LVEF at 12 months, 3.5 (1.5-5.5) for BMNCs and 3.7 (1.5-6.0) for placebo (P=0.850). Left ventricular systolic and diastolic volumes, New York Heart Association functional class, Minnesota quality-of-life questionnaire, brain natriuretic peptide concentrations, and 6-minute walking test did also not differ between groups. Conclusion-Intracoronary injection of autologous BMNCs does not improve left ventricular function or quality of life in patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease is a trypanosomiasis whose agent is the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted to humans by hematophagous bugs known as triatomines. Even though insecticide treatments allow effective control of these bugs in most Latin American countries where Chagas disease is endemic, the disease still affects a large proportion of the population of South America. The features of the disease in humans have been extensively studied, and the genome of the parasite has been sequenced, but no effective drug is yet available to treat Chagas disease. The digestive tract of the insect vectors in which T. cruzi develops has been much less well investigated than blood from its human hosts and constitutes a dynamic environment with very different conditions. Thus, we investigated the composition of the predominant bacterial species of the microbiota in insect vectors from Rhodnius, Triatoma, Panstrongylus and Dipetalogaster genera. Methodology/Principal Findings: Microbiota of triatomine guts were investigated using cultivation-independent methods, i.e., phylogenetic analysis of 16s rDNA using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and cloned-based sequencing. The Chao index showed that the diversity of bacterial species in triatomine guts is low, comprising fewer than 20 predominant species, and that these species vary between insect species. The analyses showed that Serratia predominates in Rhodnius, Arsenophonus predominates in Triatoma and Panstrongylus, while Candidatus Rohrkolberia predominates in Dipetalogaster. Conclusions/Significance: The microbiota of triatomine guts represents one of the factors that may interfere with T. cruzi transmission and virulence in humans. The knowledge of its composition according to insect species is important for designing measures of biological control for T. cruzi. We found that the predominant species of the bacterial microbiota in triatomines form a group of low complexity whose structure differs according to the vector genus. © 2012 da Mota et al.

AB  - The Serra-Dória procedure has been used in the treatment of advanced or relapsed megaesophagus due to Chagas disease. Little is known, however, about cardiovascular complications following this procedure. The purpose of this study was to settle independent predictors of cardiovascular complications following the Serra-Dória procedure in patients with megaesophagus secondary to chronic Chagas disease. A total of 76 patients who underwent the Serra-Dória operation for Chagas disease megaesophagus from 1998 to 2010 were included. A multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of cardiovascular complications. Mean age was 61 ± 10 years; 55% were male. Advanced megaesophagus (grades III/IV) were found in 65 (86%) of patients. Twenty-two (29%) patients had one comorbidity, and five (7%) three co-morbidities before operation. Two (3%) patients died following the operation. Twenty-nine (38%) patients presented cardiovascular complication following the Serra-Dória procedure; 15 (44%) were mild, 7 (21%) moderate, and 12 (35%) severe. Age > 61 years was the only independent predictor of cardiovascular complication following Serra-Dória procedure. In patients with megaesophagus secondary to chronic Chagas disease, the Serra-Dória procedure is associated with a low mortality rate and a high frequency of cardiac complication. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To discover new possible therapies for Chagas' disease, we evaluated against all Trypanosoma cruzi life stages the in vitro trypanocidal and synergistic activity of terpenes isolated from Copaifera oleoresins collected in the Amazon and investigated their possible mechanism of action. Seven acid diterpenes and one sesquiterpene were tested. Terpenes promoted changes in oxidative metabolism followed by autophagic processes in the parasite cell leading to selective death. Furthermore, they were more effective against replicative forms, in particular amastigotes. A synergistic effect occurred. Cytotoxicity to erythrocytes and nucleated cells was moderate. This is the first study showing synergic activity between two terpenes against T. cruzi. Combinations of natural compounds can show high activity and may lead to new alternative treatments in the future. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The innate immune system is the first mechanism of vertebrate defense against pathogen infection. In this study, we present evidence for a novel immune evasion mechanism of Trypanosoma cruzi, mediated by host cell plasma membrane-derived vesicles. We found that T. cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes induced microvesicle release from blood cells early in infection. Upon their release, microvesicles formed a complex on the T. cruzi surface with the complement C3 convertase, leading to its stabilization and inhibition, and ultimately resulting in increased parasite survival. Furthermore, we found that TGF-β-bearing microvesicles released from monocytes and lymphocytes promoted rapid cell invasion by T. cruzi, which also contributed to parasites escaping the complement attack. In addition, in vivo infection with T. cruzi showed a rapid increase of microvesicle levels in mouse plasma, and infection with exogenous microvesicles resulted in increased T. cruzi parasitemia. Altogether, these data support a role for microvesicles contributing to T. cruzi evasion of innate immunity. Copyright © 2012 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.

AB  - Background: Chagas' disease is an important neglected public health problem in many Latin American countries, but population-based epidemiological data are scarce. Here we present a nationwide analysis on Chagas-associated mortality, and risk factors for death from this disease. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed all death certificates of individuals who died between 1999 and 2007 in Brazil, based on the nationwide Mortality Information System (a total of 243 data sets with about 9 million entries). Chagas' disease was mentioned in 53,930 (0.6%) of death certificates, with 44,537 (82.6%) as an underlying cause and 9,387 (17.4%) as an associated cause of death. Acute Chagas' disease was responsible for 2.8% of deaths. The mean standardized mortality rate was 3.36/100.000 inhabitants/year. Nationwide standardized mortality rates reduced gradually, from 3.78 (1999) to 2.78 (2007) deaths/year per 100,000 inhabitants (-26.4%). Standardized mortality rates were highest in the Central-West region, ranging from 15.23 in 1999 to 9.46 in 2007 (-37.9%), with a significant negative linear trend (p = 0.001; R 2 = 82%). Proportional mortality considering multiple causes of death was 0.60%. The Central-West showed highest proportional mortality among regions (2.17%), with a significant linear negative trend, from 2.28% to 1.90% (-19.5%; p = 0.001; R 2 = 84%). There was a significant increase in the Northeast of 38.5% (p = 0.006; R 2 = 82%). Bivariable analysis on risk factors for death from Chagas' disease showed highest relative risks (RR) in older age groups (RR: 10.03; 95% CI: 9.40-10.70; p&lt;0.001) and those residing in the Central-West region (RR: 15.01; 95% CI: 3.90-16.22; p&lt;0.001). In logistic regression analysis, age ≥30 years (adjusted OR: 10.81; 95% CI: 10.03-10.65; p&lt;0.001) and residence in one of the three high risk states Minas Gerais, Goiás or the Federal District (adjusted OR: 5.12; 95% CI: 5.03-5.22, p&lt;0.001) maintained important independent risk factors for death by Chagas' disease. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first nationwide population-based study on Chagas mortality in Brazil, considering multiple causes of death. Despite the decline of mortality associated with Chagas' disease in Brazil, the disease remains a serious public health problem with marked regional differences. © 2012 Martins-Melo et al.

Vertical transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi infection: quantification of parasite burden in mothers and their children by parasite DNA amplification. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 106(10), 623–628 (2012). The congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi has gained epidemiological importance because it is partially responsible for the spread of Chagas disease worldwide. The feasibility of a cure when infected children are treated early makes the detection of congenital infection a valuable goal toward the control of the disease. Here, the authors review and discuss the findings of Bua et al., who quantified the parasitemia of infected women and their newborns by quantitative PCR. The authors demonstrate that the maternal parasite burden is directly related to the risk of neonatal infection. This study points out the importance of a quantitative screen for T. cruzi in pregnant women who live in, or have traveled to, endemic areas for improving the diagnosis of infected newborns and providing prompt treatment. © 2012, Expert Reviews Ltd.

AB  - Chagas disease, or American Trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which is in turn transmitted by blood-sucking insects of the subfamily Triatominae (family Reduviidae). Because no drugs or vaccines are available to cure Chagas disease in its chronic phase, vectorial control (i.e., insecticide spraying) constitutes the principal means by which to impair Chagas disease transmission. Environmental and social factors have caused changes in the epidemiology of this disease - it was originally restricted to Latin America, but is now becoming a global heath concern in non-endemic areas as a consequence of human migrations. In Brazil, despite the fact that the most effective vector has been controlled, other triatomine species infest and colonize domiciliary habitats and can transmit the pathogen. As a consequence, Chagas disease transmission continues: the prevalence of the disease remains at ∼12 million people, with ∼200,000 new cases per year in 15 countries of Latin America, making control actions still necessary. Understanding the environmental requirements and geographic distributions of vectors is key to guiding control measures, and understanding better epidemiologic aspects of the disease. Ecologic niche modeling is a relatively new tool that permits such insights - as a consequence, here, we present an overview of insights gained using this approach in understanding of Chagas disease. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, and is considered a public health problem. The current treatments for this disease are the synthetic drugs nifurtimox and benzonidazol, which are highly toxic. Pityrogramma calomelanos, a plant used in traditional medicine as an astringent, analgesic, anti-hemorrhagic, pectoral depurative, emmenagogue, anti-hypertensive, anti-pyretic and an anti-tussive was tested for antiepimastigote activity in vitro. An ethanol extract and hexane fraction of P. calomelanos was prepared and tested against T. cruzi (CL-B5 clone). The effective concentration capable of killing 50 of parasites (EC50) was 55.26 μg/mL and 73.57 μg/mL for the ethanol extract and hexane fraction, respectively. This is the first record of tripanocidal activity for P. calomelanos. Our results indicate that P. calomelanos could be a source of antiepimastigote natural products with only moderate toxicity toward healthy human cells. © 2012, American Fern Society.

AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the potential usefulness of Trypanosoma cruzi lysate, recombinant protein JL7, and peptides P013, R13, JL18, JL19, and P0b as serological markers for human Chagas disease. We analyzed 228 sera from Brazilian Chagas disease patients classified into four clinical groups and 108 from non-chagasic patients. We defined the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa index measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As previously described, the highest values of diagnostic parameters were achieved for T. cruzi lysate and JL7; peptide P013 showed high specificity but low sensitivity. The other peptides resulted in lower sensitivity and specificity in our ELISA than T. cruzi lysate and JL7 protein. Antibodies against JL7 protein were mainly detected in sera from patients with severe chagasic cardiomyopathy, compared with those from the indeterminate form, whereas peptides failed to discriminate between the clinical forms of the disease.

AB  - Introduction: The goal was to develop an in-house serological method with high specificity and sensitivity for diagnosis and monitoring of Chagas disease morbidity. Methods: With this purpose, the reactivities of anti-T. cruzi IgG and subclasses were tested in successive serum dilutions of patients from Berilo municipality, Jequitinhonha Valley, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The performance of the in-house ELISA was also evaluated in samples from other relevant infectious diseases, including HIV, hepatitis C (HCV), syphilis (SYP), visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL), and noninfected controls (NI). Further analysis was performed to evaluate the applicability of this in-house methodology for monitoring Chagas disease morbidity into three groups of patients: indeterminate (IND), cardiac (CARD), and digestive/mixed (DIG/Mix), based on their clinical status. Results: The analysis of total IgG reactivity at serum dilution 1:40 was an excellent approach to Chagas disease diagnosis (100% sensitivity and specificity). The analysis of IgG subclasses showed cross-reactivity, mainly with NI, VL, and ATL, at all selected serum dilutions. Based on the data analysis, the IND group displayed higher IgG3 levels and the DIG/Mix group presented higher levels of total IgG as compared with the IND and CARD groups. Conclusions: These findings demonstrated that methodology presents promising applicability in the analysis of anti-T. cruzi IgG reactivity for the differential diagnosis and evaluation of Chagas disease morbidity.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi infection has a large public health impact in Latin American countries. Although the transmission rates via blood transfusions and insect vectors have declined sharply in the past 20 years due to policies of the Southern Cone countries, a large number of people are still at risk for infection. Currently, no accepted experimental model or descriptions of the clinical signs that occur during the course of acute murine infection are available. The aim of this work was to use non-invasive methods to evaluate the clinical signs of Balb/c mice infected with the Y strain of T. cruzi. The infected mice displayed evident clinical changes beginning in the third week of infection. The mice were evaluated based on physical characteristics, spontaneous activity, exploratory behaviour and physiological alterations. We hope that the results presented in this report provide parameters that complement the effective monitoring of trypanocidal treatment and other interventions used to treat experimental Chagas disease.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is a devastating parasitic infection affecting millions of people. Although many efforts have been made for the development of immunotherapies, there is no available vaccine against this deadly infection. One major hurdle for the rational approach to develop a T. cruzi vaccine is the limited information about the proteins produced by different phylogenetic lineages, strains, and stages of the parasite. Here, we have adapted a 1D nanoHPLC system to perform online 2D LC-MS/MS, using the autosampler to inject the eluting salt solutions in the first dimension separation. The application of this methodology for the proteomic analysis of the infective trypomastigote stage of T. cruzi led to the identification of 1448 nonredundant proteins. Furthermore, about 14% of the identified sequences comprise surface proteins, most of them glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored and related to parasite pathogenesis. Immunoinformatic analysis revealed thousands of potential peptides with predicted high-binding affinity for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II molecules. The high diversity of proteins expressed on the trypomastigote surface may have many implications for host-cell invasion and immunoevasion mechanisms triggered by the parasite. Finally, we performed a rational approach to filter potential T-cell epitopes that could be further tested and validated for development of a Chagas disease vaccine. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - American trypanosomiasis, or Chagas' disease, is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and affects around 15 million people throughout the American continent. The available treatment is based on two nitroheterocyclic drugs, nifurtimox and benznidazole, both only partially effective and toxic. In this context, new drugs must be found. In our previous work, the tetrahydro-β-carboline compound N-butyl-1-(4-dimethylamino)phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline- 3-carboxamide, named C4, showed a potent in vitro trypanocidal effect. The goal of this study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo trypanocidal effects of the compound C4 associated with other drugs (benznidazole, ketoconazole, and amphotericin B). For this, we used the checkerboard technique to analyze the effect of combinations of C4 reference drugs. C4 was assayed in a murine model alone as well as in association with benznidazole. We also evaluated the parasitemia, mortality, weight, and presence of amastigote nests in cardiac tissue. A synergic effect of C4 plus benznidazole against epimastigote and trypomastigote forms was observed in vitro, and in the murine model, we observed a substantial reduction in parasitemia levels and lowered mortality rates. These findings encourage supplementary investigations of carboline compounds as potential new trypanocidal drugs. Copyright © 2012, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The protist parasite Trypanosoma cruzi has evolved the ability to transit between completely different hosts and to replicate in adverse environments. In particular, the epimastigote form, the replicative stage inside the vector, is subjected to nutritional and osmotic stresses during its development. In this work, we describe the biochemical and global gene expression changes of epimastigotes under hyperosmotic conditions. Hyperosmotic stress resulted in cell shrinking within a few minutes. Depending on the medium osmolarity, this was followed by lack of volume recovery for at least 2 h or by slow recovery. Experiments with inhibitors, or with cells in which an aquaporin gene (TcAQP1) was knocked down or overexpressed, revealed its importance for the cellular response to hyperosmotic stress. Furthermore, the adaptation to this new environment was shown to involve the regulation of the polyphosphate polymerization state as well as changes in amino acid catabolism to generate compatible osmolytes. A genome-wide transcriptional analysis of stressed parasites revealed down-regulation of genes belonging to diverse functional categories and up-regulation of genes encoding trans-sialidase-like and ribosomal proteins. Several of these changes were confirmed by Northern blot analyses. Sequence analysis of the 3′UTRs of up- and down-regulated genes allowed the identification of conserved structural RNA motifs enriched in each group, suggesting that specific ribonucleoprotein complexes could be of great importance in the adaptation of this parasite to different environments through regulation of transcript abundance. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - Chagas disease is endemic in Latin America and has become an emerging problem in developed countries because of international migrations. The protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent and the disease is divided into two phases. The acute phase is mostly asymptomatic or presents with unspecific symptoms. Rarely, a severe and often fatal form occurs in immunosuppressed patients or infants, characterized by meningoencephalitis (sometimes including brain tumor-like lesions) and myocarditis. The chronic phase consists of an indeterminate, asymptomatic form followed by digestive, cardiac, or neurologic symptoms in about 30% of infected patients. Autonomous nervous system dysfunction is prominent in chagasic patients and participates in the affliction of the target organs. Stroke, mainly cardioembolic, may occur in the chronic phase, but other stroke etiologies are reported. Embolic sources and inflammation are thought to play a role in stroke mechanisms. Specific treatment for Chagas disease is scarce and preventive measures are needed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of anemia on outcome of patients with chronic systolic heart failure secondary to Chagas' cardiomyopathy, as no previous study has previously addressed this question. One-hundred-eight-six patients followed for chronic systolic heart failure secondary to Chagas' cardiomyopathy at our Institution from January 2000 to December 2008 were studied. Forty-nine (26%) patients were found to have anemia; 37 (20%) were men and 12 (6%) were women. Mean hemoglobin level was 14.1. ±. 1.2. g/L in patients with no anemia and 11.5. ±. 1.2. g/L in patients with anemia.On a Cox proportional hazards multivariate analysis, anemia was a predictor of all-cause mortality neither in the univariate nor in the multivariate analysis. Mean serum sodium (Hazard ratio. = 0.92; Beta-coefficient. = -0.09; 95% confidence interval 0.89-0.96; p value. <. 0.005), and Beta-Blocker therapy (Hazard ratio. = 0.40; 95% confidence interval 0.26-0.61; p value. <. 0.005) were retained as independent predictors of mortality for patients with Chagas' cardiomyopathy with chronic heart failure. Probability of survival for patients with anemia, however, was significantly lower in patients with anemia in comparison to patients with no anemia, mainly in patients with advanced heart failure. Anemia is not an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with Chagas' cardiomyopathy with chronic systolic heart failure. Probability of survival is poorer in patients with anemia than in those without. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - NMR J-couplings across hydrogen bonds reflect the static and dynamic character of hydrogen bonding. They are affected by thermal and solvent effects and can therefore be used to probe such effects. We have applied density functional theory (DFT) to compute the NMR nJ(N,H) scalar couplings of a prototypical Chagas disease drug (metronidazole). The calculations were done for the molecule in vacuo, in microsolvated cluster models with one or few water molecules, in snapshots obtained from molecular dynamics simulations with explicit water solvent, and in a polarizable dielectric continuum. Hyperconjugative and electrostatic effects on spin - spin coupling constants were assessed through DFT calculations using natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and atoms in molecules (AIM) theory. In the calculations with explicit solvent molecules, special attention was given to the nature of the hydrogen bonds formed with the solvent molecules. The results highlight the importance of properly incorporating thermal and solvent effects into NMR calculations in the condensed phase. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Chagas' disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is one of the most important endemic problems in Latin America. Lately, it has also become a health concern in the United States and Europe. Currently, a diagnosis of Chagas' disease and the screening of blood supplies for antiparasite antibodies are achieved by conventional serological tests that show substantial variation in the reproducibility and reliability of their results. In addition, the specificity of these assays is curtailed by antigenic crossreactivity with sera from patients affected by other endemic diseases, such as leishmaniasis. Here we used a highly sensitive chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CL-ELISA) to evaluate a recombinant protein core of a mucin-like molecule (termed trypomastigote small surface antigen [TSSA]) for the detection of specific serum antibodies in a broad panel of human sera. The same samples were evaluated by CL-ELISA using as the antigen either a mixture of native T. cruzi trypomastigote mucins or an epimastigote extract and, for further comparison, by conventional serologic tests, such as an indirect hemagglutination assay and indirect immunofluorescence assay. TSSA showed ∼87% sensitivity among the seropositive Chagasic panel, a value which was increased up to >98% when only parasitologically positive samples were considered. More importantly, TSSA showed a significant increase in specificity (97.4%) compared to those of currently used assays, which averaged 80 to 90%. Overall, our data demonstrate that recombinant TSSA may be a useful antigen for the immunodiagnosis of Chagas' disease. Copyright © 2011, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Although the roles of mast cells (MCs) are essential in many inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, their role in Trypanosoma cruziinduced cardiomyopathy is unexplored. In this study, we treated infected CBA mice with cromolyn, an MC stabilizer, and observed much greater parasitemia and interferon-γ levels, higher mortality, myocarditis, and cardiac damage. Although these data show that MCs are important in controlling acute infection, we observed MC apoptosis in the cardiac tissue and peritoneal cavity of untreated mice. In the heart, pericardial mucosal MC die, perhaps because of reduced amounts of local stem cell factor. Using RT-PCR in purified cardiac MCs, we observed that infection induced transcription of P2X 7 receptor and Fas, two molecules reportedly involved in cell death and inflammatory regulation. In gld/gld mice (FasL -/-), apoptosis of cardiac, but not peritoneal, MCs was decreased. Conversely, infection of P2X 7 -/- mice led to reduced peritoneal, but not cardiac, MC death. These data illustrate the immunomodulatory role played by MCs in T. cruzi infection and the complexity of molecular interactions that control inflammatory pathways in different tissues and compartments. © 2011 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

AB  - Due to limited efficacy and considerable toxicity, the therapy for Chagas' disease is far from being ideal, and thus new compounds are desirable. Diamidines and related compounds such as arylimidamides have promising trypanocidal activity against Trypanosoma cruzi. To better understand the mechanism of action of these heterocyclic cations, we investigated the kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) binding properties and trypanocidal efficacy against T. cruzi of 13 compounds. Four diamidines (DB75, DB569, DB1345, and DB829), eight arylimidamides (DB766, DB749, DB889, DB709, DB613, DB1831, DB1852, and DB2002), and one guanylhydrazone (DB1080) were assayed in thermal denaturation (T m) and circular dichroism (CD) studies using whole purified T. cruzi kDNA and a conserved synthetic parasite sequence. The overall CD spectra using the whole kDNA were similar to those found for the conserved sequence and were indicative of minor groove binding. Our findings showed that some of the compounds that exhibited the highest trypanocidal activities (e.g., DB766) caused low or no change in the T m measurements. However, while some active compounds, such as DB766, induced profound alterations of kDNA topology, others, like DB1831, although effective, did not result in altered T m and CD measurements. Our data suggest that the strong affinity of amidines with kDNA per se is not sufficient to generate and trigger their trypanocidal activity. Cell uptake differences and possibly distinct cellular targets need to be considered in the final evaluation of the mechanisms of action of these compounds.

AB  - Paracoccidioidomycosis has been known for over 100 years, and until now, there were only few estimates of the disease's incidence. We aim to analyze 1,000 cases treated between 1960 and 1999 at Ribeirão Preto city, São Paulo, Brazil, where the disease's incidence range detected was 1.6 to 3.7 cases per 100,000 habitants per year (mean = 2.7 cases/year). We observed a male to female ratio of 6:1 and an age distribution from 3 to 85 years. The acute/subacute form of the disease accounted for 25.4% of cases. Most of the patients (93.5%) had lived or worked in rural areas before the disease development. Smoking and alcoholism were reported by 64.7% and 37.2% of patients, respectively. Comorbidities identified included tuberculosis (8.3%), Chagas' disease (8.6%), and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (4.2%). The present study revealed an area in Brazil where paracoccidioidomycosis is hyperendemic (has the highest reported incidence of this disease); this endemic area is probably caused by geological and climatic conditions as well as intensive agriculture.

AB  - The classical hypothesis proposes that Chagas disease has been originated in the Andean region among prehistoric people when they started domesticating animals, changing to sedentary habits, and adopting agriculture. These changes in their way of life happened nearly 6,000 years ago. However, paleoparasitological data based on molecular tools showed that Trypanosoma cruzi infection and Chagas disease were commonly found both in South and North American prehistoric populations long before that time, suggesting that Chagas disease may be as old as the human presence in the American continent. The study of the origin and dispersion of Trypanosoma cruzi infection among prehistoric human populations may help in the comprehension of the clinical and epidemiological questions on Chagas disease that still remain unanswered.

AB  - UNC93B1 associates with TLR3, 7, and 9, mediating their translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the endolysosome, thus allowing proper activation by microbial nucleic acids. We found that the triple-deficient 3d mice, which lack functional UNC93B1 as well as functional endosomal TLRs, are highly susceptible to infection with Trypanosoma cruzi. The enhanced parasitemia and mortality in 3d animals were associated with impaired proinflammatory response, including reduced levels of IL-12p40 and IFN-γ. Importantly, the phenotype of 3d mice was intermediary between MyD88-/- (highly susceptible) and TLR9-/- (moderately susceptible), indicating the involvement of an additional UN93B1-dependent TLR(s) on host resistance to T. cruzi. Hence, our experiments also revealed that TLR7 is a critical innate immune receptor involved in recognition of parasite RNA, induction of IL-12p40 by dendritic cells, and consequent IFN-γ by T lymphocytes. Furthermore, we show that upon T. cruzi infection, triple TLR3/7/9-/- mice had similar phenotype than 3d mice. These data imply that the nucleic acid-sensing TLRs are critical determinants of host resistance to primary infection with T. cruzi.

AB  - Parasitic protozoan diseases affect the poorest population in developing countries. Leishmaniasis and Chagas disease have been included among the most important threats for public health in Central and South American continent, with few therapeutic alternatives and highly toxic drugs. In the course of selection of novel drug candidates, we studied the anti-protozoal potential of Drimys brasiliensis. Thus, the crude hexane extract from stem bark as well as its main derivative, the sesquiterpene polygodial, were tested using in vitro assays. The crude hexane extract and polygodial showed activity against Leishmania spp. in the range between 22 and 62 μg/mL, but polygodial demonstrated high parasite selectivity towards Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes (2 μg/mL), with a selectivity index of 19. Finally, polygodial showed a leishmanicidal effect, inducing intense ultrastructural damages in Leishmania in short-time incubation. The obtained results suggested that polygodial could be used as a tool for drug design studies against protozoan diseases and as a candidate molecule for further in vivo studies against T. cruzi. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Vectorial, transfusion and congenital are considered the main transmission mechanisms in human Chagas disease. Alternative mechanisms are accidental, oral and by organ transplantation. Other hypothetic mechanisms could be by other vectors, sexual, criminal and by means of marsupial anal secretions. The present accorded strategies for prevention are: Congenital: early case detection and immediate treatment. If possible, start during the pre natal period, throughout mothers serology, performing parasitological tests in the new born from positive women. For positive cases, immediate treatment; for those negative babies, conventional serology at the 8th month, treating specifically those with positive results. Accidental transmission: Rigorous training and utilization of protection equipments. IF accident occurs, immediate disinfection, conventional serology and beginning of specific treatment by ten days. Revision of the serology after 30 days: if positive, extend the treatment until the total dose (60 days or more). Organ transplantation: previous serology for donor and receptor. When the former is infected and the last negative, cancel the surgery or install the specific treatment by ten days before the surgery for the donor, followed by the receptor during ten days after the transplantation. Oral transmission: Specific measures are not available, food hygiene is recommended, including the cooking of meats delivered from possible reservoirs. Nowadays, the detection and immediate treatment of the case is recommended, followed by active research of new cases around the detected one.

AB  - Much has been achieved in one century after Carlos Chagas' discovery. However, there is surely much to be done in the next decades. At present, we are witnessing many remarkable efforts to monitor the epidemiology of the disease, to better understand the biology of the T. cruzi and its interaction with human beings as well as the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the complications in the chronic phase, and deal more appropriately and effectively with late cardiac and digestive manifestations. Although the vector and transfusion-derived transmission of the disease has been controlled in many countries, there remains a pressing need for sustained surveillance of the measures that led to this achievement. It is also necessary to adopt initiatives that enable appropriate management of social and medical conditions resulting from the migration of infected individuals to countries where the disease formerly did not exist. It ́s also necessary to standardize the most reliable methods of detection of infection with T. cruzi, not only for diagnosis purposes, but more crucially, as a cure criterion. The etiological treatment of millions of patients in the chronic stage of the disease is also to be unraveled. A renewed interest in this area is observed, including prospects of studies focusing on the association of drugs with benznidazole. We also wait for full evidence of the actual effectiveness of the etiological treatment to impact favorably on the natural history of the disease in its chronic phase. Eventually, cardiologists are primarily responsible for improving the clinical management of their patients with Chagas' disease, judiciously prescribing drugs and interventions that respect, as much as possible, the peculiar pathophysiology of the disease, wasting no plausible therapeutic opportunities.

AB  - We report a patient with severe multi-bacillary leprosy complicated by recurrent episodes of erythema nodosum necrotisans that required thalidomide and/or corticosteroids during follow-up. Although the patient was from an area to which Chagas disease is endemic, this diagnosis was initially missed and was only investigated when heart failure developed in the patient. The difficulties of managing erythema nodosum necrotisans and heart failure concomitantly and those involved in excluding the diagnosis of acute myocarditis caused by reactivation of Chagas disease secondary to the immunosuppressive regimen are discussed. Other potential causes for the heart failure and possible interactions between the two diseases and their treatments are discussed. We also reviewed the literature for the association between leprosy and Chagas disease, both of which are highly endemic in Brazil. This case emphasizes the importance of searching for subclinical co-infections in leprosy patients because reactions frequently develop during specific treatment in these patients, and these reactions require prolonged therapy with immunosuppressive drugs.

AB  - The need for novel and efficacious drugs against neglected parasitic diseases, such as Leishmaniasis and American Trypanosomiasis, is certainly apparent. In this work, we evaluated the in vitro potential of the calcium channel blocker bepridil against Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi parasites and exploited an experimental assay using a hamster model with Leishmania (L.) chagasi, with a real-time PCR method for therapeutic evaluation. Bepridil was in vitro effective against promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes of L. (L.) chagasi, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 3.81 and 21.55μM, respectively. Leishmania (L.) amazonensis, L. (L.) major and L. (V.) braziliensis promastigotes and T. cruzi trypomastigotes were also susceptible to bepridil, with in vitro selectivity toward parasites and IC50 values in the range of 3 to 7μM. The mammalian cytotoxicity using LLC-MK2 cells resulted in an IC50 value of 62.67μM. However, bepridil showed lack of activity at 12mg/kg in the experimental hamster model infected with L. (L.) chagasi parasites. However, the real-time PCR was a promising tool for the accurate and fast quantification of RNA of living parasites in the liver and spleen of infected hamsters after treatment, eliminating time-consuming light microscopy evaluations. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Gaudichaudianic acid, a prenylated chromene isolated from Piper gaudichaudianum, has been described as a potent trypanocidal compound against the Y-strain of Trypanosoma cruzi. We herein describe its isolation as a racemic mixture followed by enantiomeric resolution using chiral HPLC and determination of the absolute configuration of the enantiomers as (+)-S and (-)-R by means of a combination of electronic and vibrational circular dichroism using density functional theory calculations. Investigation of the EtOAc extract of the roots, stems, and leaves from both adult specimens and seedlings of P. gaudichaudianum revealed that gaudichaudianic acid is biosynthesized as a racemic mixture from the seedling stage onward. Moreover, gaudichaudianic acid was found exclusively in the roots of seedlings, while it is present in all organs of the adult plant. Trypanocidal assays indicated that the (+)-enantiomer was more active than its antipode. Interestingly, mixtures of enantiomers showed a synergistic effect, with the racemic mixture being the most active.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi infection causes intense myocarditis, leading to cardiomyopathy and severe cardiac dysfunction. Protective adaptive immunity depends on balanced signaling through a T cell receptor and coreceptors expressed on the T cell surface. Such coreceptors can trigger stimulatory or inhibitory signals after binding to their ligands in antigen-presenting cells (APC). T. cruzi modulates the expression of coreceptors in lymphocytes after infection. Deregulated inflammation may be due to unbalanced expression of these molecules. Programmed death cell receptor 1 (PD-1) is a negative T cell coreceptor that has been associated with T cell anergy or exhaustion and persistent intracellular infections. We aimed to study the role of PD-1 during T. cruzi-induced acute myocarditis in mice. Cytometry assays showed that PD-1 and its ligands are strongly upregulated in lymphocytes and APC in response to T. cruzi infection in vivo and in vitro. Lymphocytes infiltrating the myocardium exhibited high levels of expression of these molecules. An increased cardiac inflammatory response was found in mice treated with blocking antibodies against PD-1, PD-L1, and to a lesser extent, PD-L2, compared to that found in mice treated with rat IgG. Similar results in PD-1-/- mice were obtained. Moreover, the PD-1 blockade/deficiency led to reduced parasitemia and tissue parasitism but increased mortality. These results suggest the participation of a PD-1 signaling pathway in the control of acute myocarditis induced by T. cruzi and provide additional insight into the regulatory mechanisms in the pathogenesis of Chagas' disease. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of heart failure in Latin American countries, being associated with intense inflammatory response and fibrosis. We have previously shown that bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMC) transplantation improves inflammation, fibrosis and ventricular diameter in hearts of mice with chronic Chagas disease. Here we investigated the transcriptomic recovery induced by BMC therapy by comparing the heart transcriptomes of chagasic mice treated with BMC or saline with control animals. Out of the 9,390 unique genes quantified in all samples, 1,702 had their expression altered in chronic chagasic hearts compared to those of normal mice. Major categories of significantly upregulated genes were related to inflammation, fibrosis and immune responses, while genes involved in mitochondrion function were downregulated. When BMC-treated chagasic hearts were compared to infected mice, 96% of the alterations detected in infected hearts were restored to normal levels, although an additional 109 genes were altered by treatment. Transcriptomic recovery, a new measure that considers both restorative and side effects of treatment, was remarkably high (84%). Immunofluorescence and morphometric analyses confirmed the effects of BMC therapy in the pattern of inflammatory-immune response and expression of adhesion molecules. In conclusion, by using large-scale gene profiling for unbiased assessment of therapeutic efficacy we demonstrate immunomodulatory effects of BMC therapy in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy and identify potentially relevant factors involved in the pathogenesis of the disease that may provide new therapeutic targets. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.

AB  - Chagas' disease, caused by the hemoflagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, affects millions of people in South and Central America. Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, the most devastating manifestation of this disease, occurs in approximately one-third of infected individuals. Events associated with the parasite's tropism for and invasion of cardiomyocytes have been the focus of intense investigation in recent years. In the present study, we use murine microarrays to investigate the cellular response caused by invasion of primary murine cardiomyocytes by T. cruzi trypomastigotes. These studies identified 353 murine genes that were differentially expressed during the early stages of invasion and infection of these cells. Genes associated with the immune response, inflammation, cytoskeleton organization, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, apoptosis, cell cycle, and oxidative stress are among those affected during the infection. Our data indicate that T. cruzi induces broad modulations of the host cell machinery in ways that provide insight into how the parasite survives, replicates, and persists in the infected host and ultimately defines the clinical outcome of the infection. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Recently, we described a heterologous prime-boost strategy using plasmid DNA followed by replication-defective human recombinant adenovirus type 5 as a powerful strategy to elicit long-lived CD8+ T-cell-mediated protective immunity against experimental systemic infection of mice with a human intracellular protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi. In the present study, we further characterized the protective long-lived CD8+ T cells. We compared several functional and phenotypic aspects of specific CD8+ T cells present 14 or 98 days after the last immunizing dose and found the following: (i) the numbers of specific cells were similar, as determined by multimer staining or by determining the number of gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-secreting cells by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay; (ii) these cells were equally cytotoxic in vivo; (iii) following in vitro stimulation, a slight decline in the frequency of multifunctional cells (CD107a+ IFN-γ+ or CD107a+ IFN-γ+ tumor necrosis factor alpha positive [TNF-α+]) was paralleled by a significant increase of CD107a singly positive cells after 98 days; (iv) the expression of several surface markers was identical, except for the reexpression of CD127 after 98 days; (v) the use of genetically deficient mice revealed a role for interleukin-12 (IL-12)/IL-23, but not IFN-γ, in the maintenance of these memory cells; and (vi) subsequent immunizations with an unrelated virus or a plasmid vaccine or the depletion of CD4+ T cells did not significantly erode the number or function of these CD8+ T cells during the 15-week period. From these results, we concluded that heterologous plasmid DNA prime-adenovirus boost vaccination generated a stable pool of functional protective long-lived CD8+ T cells with an effector memory phenotype. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Background: Although there is anatomopathologic evidence of atrial involvement in Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM), the impact in left atrial (LA) function is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate LA function in patients with CCM with real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE) and to compare it with patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Methods: A total of 30 patients with CCM, 30 patients with DCM, and 20 normal subjects used as the control group were studied. With the use of RT3DE, we measured LA maximum (maxLAV), minimum, and pre-atrial contraction volumes and calculated total and active LA emptying fractions. Results: Left ventricular ejection fraction and mitral regurgitation were similar in both groups. MaxLAV/m2 was larger in the CCM group than in the DCM group (76.9 ± 21.9 mL vs. 59.1 ± 26.0 mL; P &lt; .01), and both were significantly larger than in the control group (P &lt; .01). Total LA emptying fraction was lower in the CCM group than in the DCM group (0.30 ± 0.10 vs. 0.40 ± 0.12; P &lt; .01), and both were lower than in the control group (P = .01). Active LA emptying fraction was also lower in the CCM group than in the DCM group (0.22 ± 0.09 vs. 0.28 ± 0.11; P &lt; .01), and both were lower than in the control group (P = .01). The E/e' ratio was higher in the CCM group than in the DCM group (21 ± 10 vs. 15 ± 6; P &lt; .01), and both were greater than in the control group (P &lt; .01). In a multiple regression model, the E/e' ratio was the only independent predictor of a worsening active LA emptying fraction. Conclusion: LA function is more compromised in patients with CCM than in patients with DCM. This finding indicates a more diffuse and severe myocardial impairment in Chagas disease that is probably related to increased left ventricular filling pressures and atrial myopathy. © 2011 by the American Society of Echocardiography.

AB  - One hundred fifty-two Trypanosoma cruzi seropositive women were submitted to a single hemoculture; 101 were pregnant, and 51 were not pregnant. Seven tubes from each individual were harvested with liver infusion tryptose (LIT) medium and observed monthly until the fifth month. Hemocultures were positive in 50% (76 of 152) of the women. Results showed that the positivity was 29.4% (15 of 51) among non-pregnant women and 60.4% (61 of 101) in pregnant women ( P < 0.05). In relation to gestational age, there were significant differences in positivity, with a higher proportion of women with positive hemocultures (20 of 25) before 21 weeks and lower after 30 weeks (10 of 21; P = 0.02). We conclude that pregnancy enhances the parasitemia in Chagas disease, with a higher effect early in pregnancy. Copyright © 2011 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB  - Cardiac sympathetic denervation and ventricular arrhythmia are frequently observed in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC). This study quantitatively evaluated the association between cardiac sympathetic denervation and sustained ventricular tachycardia (SVT) in patients with CCC. Methods: We prospectively investigated patients with CCC and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 35% with SVT (SVT group: N = 15; mean age±SD, 61±8 y; LVEF, 51%±8%) and patients without SVT (non-SVT group: N = 11; mean age±SD, 55±10 y; LVEF, 57%±10%). Patients underwent myocardial scintigraphy with 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ( 123I-MIBG) for the evaluation of sympathetic innervation and resting perfusion with 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc- MIBI) for the evaluation of myocardial viability. A visual semiquantitative score was attributed for regional uptake of each radiotracer using a 17- segment left ventricular segmentation model (0, normal; 4, absence of uptake). A mismatch defect was defined as occurring in segments with a 99mTc- MIBI uptake score of 0 or 1 and a 123I-MIBG score of 2 or more. Results: Compared with the non- SVT group, the SVT group had a similar 99mTc-MIBI summed score (6.9±7.5 vs. 4.4±5.2, respectively, P = 0.69) but a higher 123I-MIBG summed score (10.9±7.8 vs. 22.4±9.5, respectively, P = 0.007) and a higher number of mismatch defects per patient (2.0±2.2 vs. 7.1±2.0, respectively, P &lt; 0.0001). The presence of more than 3 mismatch defects was strongly associated with the presence of SVT (93% sensitivity, 82% specificity; P = 0.0002). Conclusion: In CCC, the amount of sympathetically denervated viable myocardium is associated with the occurrence of SVT. Myocardial sympathetic denervation may participate in triggering malignant ventricular arrhythmia in CCC patients with relatively well-preserved ventricular function.

AB  - Zinc is an essential micronutrient and has significant effects on human growth, development, and immune function. Zinc supplementation or deficiency may affect the course of infection. Zinc enhances immune response against a wide range of viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens. In the present study, we investigated the effects of zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) supplementation (20mg/kg/day) during pregnancy in mice, Swiss Webster strain infected by the Y strain of Trypanosoma cruzi. Oral supplementation of zinc sulphate in pregnant and non-pregnant infected animals did not affect the count of blood parasites as well as tissue parasitism in the heart, liver, and spleen. Zinc supplementation did not alter female body weight, the length of fetuses and neonates, placental size/weight and mortality rate. Among zinc supplied animals, no significant plasmatic zinc concentrations were observed. Concerning to tissue zinc concentrations, only the liver displayed enhanced values as compared to other organs. For placental parasitism, zinc supplied group displayed a significant decrease in amastigote burdens (P&lt;0.05). However due to the reduced number of parasite burdens in placenta of animals supplied with zinc, these data suggest that zinc was partially effective in up-regulating the host's immune response against parasite, probably attenuating the infection in fetuses. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease (ChD) will become predominantly a disease of the elderly, as a consequence of the effectiveness of control measures in many Latin American countries. The effects of the disease in old age have received little attention. We investigated the effects of ageing in the association between cardiac vagal impairment, a typical feature of ChD, and chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Methods: The study sample of this cross-sectional study consists of 1014 subjects ≥ 60 years old (mean age = 68.3; SD = 6.9) residing in Bambuí City (Southeast Brazil). ECG was recorded and one-breath sinus arrhythmia test was performed. Maximal expiratory over the minimal inspiratory (E:I) ratio and heart rate variability (HRV) measurements were calculated. Ordinal logistic regression was used to assess the relation between vagal indexes and chronic T. cruzi infection. Results: The prevalence of T. cruzi infection was 32.0% and of major ECG abnormalities, 43.4%. Among individuals aged 60-69 years, T. cruzi infection was significantly and independently associated with reduced SDNN (OR 0.38; 95% CI 0.27-0.53), RMSSD (OR 0.48; 0.34-0.67) and EI: ratio (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.33-0.63). Among individuals aged > 70 years, no significant odds ratios were found in either the unadjusted or the adjusted analysis. The presence of major ECG abnormalities did not affect the association between vagal indexes and T. cruzi infection. Conclusions: Disease-specific vagal cardiac dysfunction was observed in ChD individuals below 70. However, further ageing interferes significantly with vagal heart modulation, attenuating the difference of HRV indexes between ChD and non-ChD subjects. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - A 63-year-old woman with the diagnosis of mega-oesophagus secondary to chronic Chagas' disease and no past cardiac history was referred for cardiac evaluation. The resting ECG showed right bundle-branch block, whereas a 2-D echocardiogram revealed marked right ventricular dilatation with hypokinesia, right atrial dilatation, normal pulmonary artery pressure, and normal left ventricular ejection fraction. A large, irregularly shaped mass, arising from the right atrium and protruding into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve, with several diff erent bizarre forms inside the right atrium during systole and/or diastole was seen on 2-D echocardiogram. Therefore, massive right-sided thrombosis can be detected in Chagas' disease patients with no overt right- and left-sided ventricular failure.

AB  - Exosome-like vesicles containing virulence factors, enzymes, and antigens have recently been characterized in fungal pathogens, such as Cryptococcus neoformans and Histoplasma capsulatum. Here, we describe extracellular vesicles carrying highly immunogenic α-linked galactopyranosyl (α-Gal) epitopes in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. P. brasiliensis is a dimorphic fungus that causes human paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). For vesicle preparations, cell-free supernatant fluids from yeast cells cultivated in Ham's defined medium-glucose were concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration system and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 X g. P. brasiliensis antigens were present in preparations from phylogenetically distinct isolates Pb18 and Pb3, as observed in immunoblots revealed with sera from PCM patients. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), vesicle components containing α-Gal epitopes reacted strongly with anti-α-Gal antibodies isolated from both Chagas' disease and PCM patients, with Marasmius oreades agglutinin (MOA) (a lectin that recognizes terminal α-Gal), but only faintly with natural anti-α-Gal. Reactivity was inhibited after treatment with α-galactosidase. Vesicle preparations analyzed by electron microscopy showed vesicular structures of 20 to 200 nm that were labeled both on the surface and in the lumen with MOA. In P. brasiliensis cells, components carrying α-Gal epitopes were found distributed on the cell wall, following a punctuated confocal pattern, and inside large intracellular vacuoles. Lipid-free vesicle fractions reacted with anti-α-Gal in ELISA only when not digested with α-galactosidase, while reactivity with glycoproteins was reduced after β-elimination, which is indicative of partial O-linked chain localization. Our findings open new areas to explore in terms of host-parasite relationships in PCM and the role played in vivo by vesicle components and α-galactosyl epitopes. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Dogs are reservoir hosts for Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of American trypanosomiasis. A rapid immunochromatographic dipstick test (ICT) is available commercially for canine serological testing. The ICT was developed with the use of sera from South American dogs, but it is not routinely used in the United States. We evaluated the utility of the ICT in detecting anti-T. cruzi antibodies in dogs from the United States. Dogs (N = 64) were experimentally infected with United States' isolates of T. cruzi from an opossum (Didelphis virginiana), an armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), and a domestic dog (Canis familiaris), and were tested after experimental infection. Sera from uninfected United States dogs (n = 79; hemaculture negative) were used as negative controls. In a blind study, sera were tested by the ICT and compared to the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test with the use of Brazil-strain epimastigotes as antigen. The sensitivity of the ICT was 91% and the specificity was 98% in dogs experimentally infected with United States isolates. Our study indicates that the ICT could be a useful screening tool for serological surveillance of canine T. cruzi exposure in the United States. © American Society of Parasitologists.

AB  - Chagas cardiomyopathy remodeling is based on the presence of Trypanosoma cruzi in heart tissue and on the complex inflammatory response leading to a myocardium fibrosis and alterations in conductive and functional heart parameters. This study aims to evaluate Simvastatin on the inflammatory response and heart functionality using dogs infected with Y strain of T. cruzi. Animals were treated daily with Simvastatin (20 mg) for 6 months and submitted to clinical and immunopathological evaluations. Simvastatin reduced heart expression and serum levels of interferon-&gamma; (IFN-&gamma;) and tumor necrosis factor-&alpha; (TNF-&alpha;) but not interleukin-10 (IL-10), possibly favoring blood parasitism but reducing inflammation and fibrosis in the left ventricle and right atrium. Simvastatin also ameliorated ejection fraction, diastolic diameter, and mass index of the left ventricle 6 months after infection. This study suggests that more investigation should be performed on the use of statins as a prophylactic therapy against cardiac remodeling because of their effects on modifying immune response and benefiting functional parameters in dogs with T. cruzi-induced ventricular dysfunctions.

AB  - The inter-relations between man and the environment are among the main themes currently debated by the Brazilian public health. On such horizon, the questions concerning Chagas's disease are found to remain - specially in the scope of the directed actions of control to the triatomine, the anti-vectorial fight -, though already a century since its first description by Carlos Chagas, a major epidemiological problem in Latin America. Based on these considerations the present article will seek to discuss the main ecological aspects related to the American trypanosomiasis, emphasizing the control of the vectorial transmission in the context of the deep ecology.

AB  - SUMOylation is a relevant protein post-translational modification in eukaryotes. The C terminus of proteolytically activated small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is covalently linked to a lysine residue of the target protein by an isopeptide bond, through a mechanism that includes an E1-activating enzyme, an E2-conjugating enzyme, and transfer to the target, sometimes with the assistance of a ligase. The modification is reversed by a protease, also responsible for SUMO maturation. A number of proteins have been identified as SUMO targets, participating in the regulation of cell cycle progression, transcription, translation, ubiquitination, and DNA repair. In this study, we report that orthologous genes corresponding to the SUMOylation pathway are present in the etiological agent of Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi. Furthermore, the SUMOylation system is functionally active in this protozoan parasite, having the requirements for SUMO maturation and conjugation. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that T. cruzi SUMO (TcSUMO) is predominantly found in the nucleus. To identify SUMOylation targets and get an insight into their physiological roles we generated transfectant T. cruzi epimastigote lines expressing a double- tagged T. cruzi SUMO, and SUMOylated proteins were enriched by tandem affinity chromatography. By two-dimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry a total of 236 proteins with diverse biological functions were identified as potential T. cruzi SUMO targets. Of these, metacaspase-3 was biochemically validated as a bona fide SUMOylation substrate. Proteomic studies in other organisms have reported that orthologs of putative T. cruzi SUMOylated proteins are similarly modified, indicating conserved functions for protein SUMOylation in this early divergent eukaryote. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - Objective: To verify the incidence of T. cruzi transmission through breastfeeding during acute experimental Chagas' disease. Methods: Fifeen female Swiss mice were mated and, afer pregnancy confrmation, placed in individual cages. A few hours afer birth, the females were inoculated with 0.1 mL of blood containing approximately 3 × 105 trypomastigote forms of Y strain of T. cruzi and continued breastfeeding for 25 days. Results: In 142 ofspring examined no infection through breastfeeding was observed. Conclusions: The low number of trypomastigote forms ingested by the newborn mice combined with biological and biochemical characteristics of blood trypomastigotes may explain the lack of transmission in this experiment. © Elsevier Editora Ltda.

AB  - Between the years 1976 and 1980, the American trypanosomiasis was searched for among residents in two geographic microregions of the State of São Paulo: Campos de Itapetininga, in the region of Sorocaba, and Encosta Ocidental da Mantiqueira Paulista, in the region of Campinas. Both areas have in the past been colonized by Triatoma infestans. Campos de Itapetininga remained, until the beginning of the 1970s as a stronghold of this species in the State of São Paulo. Panstrongylus megistus has currently colonized in these areas, now classified as having serological titer profiles characteristic of low endemicity. Transmission of Chagas disease was interrupted earlier in the Encosta Ocidental. Intense exposure to the vector in Campos de Itapetininga can explain the seroreactivity frequencies observed in people born before 1956, aged more than 20 years. Among the residents in this region born between 1972 and 1977, a low positivity rate remains, which might also include cases of congenital transmission. The mean age of seroreagents resident in the Encosta indicates that they must have been born in the 1930s; positivity levels here vary in different municipalities according to their growth in capital goods. After 1984 new criteria were adopted for the use of serology in the Program for the Control of Chagas disease, the detection of seroreagents has not been statistically associated to notification of the occurrence of domestic triatomines in these regions.

AB  - The canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) and american trypanosomiasis are important zoonoses in public health and dogs are the main domestic reservoir of the parasite for humans. The goal of this study was to estimate the prevalence of circulating antibodies anti-Trypanosoma cruzi and anti-Leishmania sp. in sera of dogs from the rural area of Botucatu, SP, Brazil. During the annual vaccination campaign against canine rabies in rural area, 689 blood samples were taken and processed by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test. The serological tests revealed the absence of antibodies anti-Leishmania spp., but anti-T. cruzi antibodies were detected in 3 (0.4%) dogs.

AB  - Previous works of our research group have demonstrated aspects of the humoral immune response of chronic Chagas disease using the cytoplasmatic repetitive antigen (CRA) and the flagellar repetitive antigen (FRA) of Trypanosoma cruzi. The aim of this work was to analyze the presence of specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in chronic chagasic patients using these recombinant antigens of T. cruzi. The positivity of IgM in chronic chagasic patients against CRA and FRA antigens was determined by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We reported no statistical significant differences between the levels of IgM for both recombinant antigens and the different chronic clinical forms of Chagas disease. However, a small proportion of chronic chagasic patients analyzed in this study was positive for this antibody isotype. The findings of this study indicate that the IgM antibodies cannot be used to elucidate the differences in the profile of humoral immune response among chronic chagasic patients with different clinical forms using the CRA and FRA recombinant antigens of T. cruzi. © 2011 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.

AB  - We present the results of the first detailed study of the antiproliferative and ultrastructural effects of amiodarone on Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease. Moreover, we report the effects of this compound on the recovery of F-actin fibrils, connexin43, and contractility in T. cruzi-infected cardiac myocytes. Amiodarone is the most prescribed class III antiarrhythmic agent and is frequently used for the symptomatic treatment of Chagas' disease patients with cardiac compromise. In addition, recent studies identified its antifungal and antiprotozoal activities, which take place through Ca2+ homeostasis disruption and ergosterol biosynthesis blockade. We tested different concentrations of amiodarone (2.5 to 10 μM) on infected primary cultures of heart muscle cells and observed a dose- and time-dependent effect on growth of the clinically relevant intracellular amastigote form of T. cruzi. Ultrastructural analyses revealed that amiodarone had a profound effect on intracellular amastigotes, including mitochondrial swelling and disorganization of reservosomes and the kinetoplast and a blockade of amastigote-trypomastigote differentiation. Amiodarone showed no toxic effects on host cells, which recovered their F-actin fibrillar organization, connexin43 distribution, and spontaneous contractility concomitant with the drug-induced eradication of the intracellular parasites. Amiodarone is, therefore, a promising compound for the development of new drugs against T. cruzi. Copyright © 2011, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma rangeli are human-infective blood parasites, largely restricted to Central and South America. They also infect a wide range of wild and domestic mammals and are transmitted by a numerous species of triatomine bugs. There are significant overlaps in the host and geographical ranges of both species. The two species consist of a number of distinct phylogenetic lineages. A range of PCR-based techniques have been developed to differentiate between these species and to assign their isolates into lineages. However, the existence of at least six and five lineages within T. cruzi and T. rangeli, respectively, makes identification of the full range of isolates difficult and time consuming. Here we have applied fluorescent fragment length barcoding (FFLB) to the problem of identifying and genotyping T. cruzi, T. rangeli and other South American trypanosomes. This technique discriminates species on the basis of length polymorphism of regions of the rDNA locus. FFLB was able to differentiate many trypanosome species known from South American mammals: T. cruzi cruzi, T. cruzi marinkellei, T. dionisii-like, T. evansi, T. lewisi, T. rangeli, T. theileri and T. vivax. Furthermore, all five T. rangeli lineages and many T. cruzi lineages could be identified, except the hybrid lineages TcV and TcVI that could not be distinguished from lineages III and II respectively. This method also allowed identification of mixed infections of T. cruzi and T. rangeli lineages in naturally infected triatomine bugs. The ability of FFLB to genotype multiple lineages of T. cruzi and T. rangeli together with other trypanosome species, using the same primer sets is an advantage over other currently available techniques. Overall, these results demonstrate that FFLB is a useful method for species diagnosis, genotyping and understanding the epidemiology of American trypanosomes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Some Latin American countries have plans for total control and/or eradication of Chagas disease by the main vector (Triatoma infestans) and by blood transfusion. To achieve this, patients with Chagas disease must be identified. A Western blotting test, TESAcruzi, is described as a supplemental test for diagnosis of Chagas disease using samples collected from children <5 years living in different states of Brazil. Blood samples collected by finger prick on filter paper were sent to the test laboratory by a central laboratory to confirm results obtained previously. Ten percent of negative samples, all doubtful and all positive samples were received. Commercial reagents, IgG indirect immunofluorescence, enzyme immunoassay, and a recently introduced TESAcruzi test were used. From 8788 samples, 163 (1.85%) were reactive by IgG-ELISA and 312 (3.55%) by IgG IIF. From these, 77 (0.87%) were reactive in the TESAcruzi test. The results had high clinical value to identify those truly infected. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Oral transmission of Chagas' disease is an unusual form of transmission of the American trypanosomiasis, and hitherto overlooked by sanitary agents. In the present communication, the time-varying trend of new cases in Brazil, from 1982 to 2007 is reported. A steady increase in new cases can be observed, from data compiled from official sanitary agencies reports, which may actually represent underestimation. Furthermore, after adjustment of a short-term polynomial to data in a best-fit procedure, the residual difference between polynomial trend and raw data uncovers a five-year cycle. This regular 0.2 cycle-per-year fluctuation accompanied El Niño Southern Oscillation and demonstrated significant cross-spectral function amplitude at a corresponding five-year cycle, and a four-year phase delay. Evolving climatic changes during this period may explain, at least in part, the time-varying pattern in oral transmission of Chagas' disease in the American continent. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Chagas disease remains a public health concern in Brazil and other Latin American countries, mainly due to the potential domiciliation of native triatomine species. We analyzed the genetic variability of Triatoma pseudomaculata in sylvatic and peridomestic ecotopes throughout three localities in the northeastern state of Bahia, Brazil. We studied polymorphisms generated by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and isoenzyme electrophoresis analyses. Based on RAPD analysis, each specimen was assigned to one of three genetic clusters. Although all sylvatic specimens from one locality were grouped into the same cluster, sylvatic and peridomestic specimens from the other two localities were broadly distributed between the remaining two clusters, suggesting that geographic population structuring was not occurring. Furthermore, isoenzyme analysis suggested that distinct populations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Low statistical values for Wright's Fst index also supported the absence of population structuring and suggested the occurrence of panmixia. We conclude that genetic flow occurs between sylvatic and peridomestic T. pseudomaculata populations, probably as a consequence of passive and active dispersion of the insects, associated with deforestation and anthropic transformations. © 2010 The Society for Vector Ecology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A major problem in Chagas disease donor screening is the high frequency of samples with inconclusive results. The objective of this study was to describe patterns of serologic results among donors to the three Brazilian REDS-II blood centers and correlate with epidemiologic characteristics. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The centers screened donor samples with one Trypanosoma cruzi lysate enzyme immunoassay (EIA). EIA-reactive samples were tested with a second lysate EIA, a recombinant-antigen based EIA, and an immunfluorescence assay. Based on the serologic results, samples were classified as confirmed positive (CP), probable positive (PP), possible other parasitic infection (POPI), and false positive (FP). RESULTS: In 2007 to 2008, a total of 877 of 615,433 donations were discarded due to Chagas assay reactivity. The prevalences (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) among first-time donors for CP, PP, POPI, and FP patterns were 114 (99-129), 26 (19-34), 10 (5-14), and 96 (82-110) per 100,000 donations, respectively. CP and PP had similar patterns of prevalence when analyzed by age, sex, education, and location, suggesting that PP cases represent true T. cruzi infections; in contrast the demographics of donors with POPI were distinct and likely unrelated to Chagas disease. No CP cases were detected among 218,514 repeat donors followed for a total of 718,187 person-years. CONCLUSION: We have proposed a classification algorithm that may have practical importance for donor counseling and epidemiologic analyses of T. cruzi-seroreactive donors. The absence of incident T. cruzi infections is reassuring with respect to risk of window phase infections within Brazil and travel-related infections in nonendemic countries such as the United States. © 2010 American Association of Blood Banks.

AB  - The need for reliable, fast diagnostics is closely linked to the need for safe, effective treatment of the so-called "neglected" diseases. The list of diseases with no field-adapted diagnostic tools includes leishmaniasis, shigella, typhoid, and bacterial meningitis. Leishmaniasis, in particular, is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania spp. transmitted by infected phlebotomine sandfly, which remains a public health concern in developing countries with ca. 12 million people infected and 350 million at risk of infection. Despite several attempts, methods for diagnosis are still noneffective, especially with regard to specificity due to false positives with Chagas' disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Accepted golden standards for detecting leishmaniasis involve isolation of parasites either microscopically, or by culture, and in both methods specimens are obtained by invasive means. Here, we show that efficient distinction between cutaneous leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease can be obtained with a low-cost biosensor system made with nanostructured films containing specific Leishmania amazonensis and T. cruzi antigens and employing impedance spectroscopy as the detection method. This unprecedented selectivity was afforded by antigen - antibody molecular recognition processes inherent in the detection with the immobilized antigens, and by statistically correlating the electrical impedance data, which allowed distinction between real samples that tested positive for Chagas' disease and leishmaniasis. Distinction could be made of blood serum samples containing 10-5 mg/mL of the antibody solution in a few minutes. The methods used here are generic and can be extended to any type of biosensor, which is important for an effective diagnosis of many other diseases. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: The knowledge about the natural history of stroke in Chagas disease is incomplete. Methods: Vascular risk factors and stroke subtypes of asymptomatic Trypanosoma cruzi-infected patients with no clinical evidence of heart failure were assessed. They were compared with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy patients who suffered a stroke and with a control group of 60 T. cruzi-noninfected stroke patients. Eighty-six consecutive chagasic stroke patients (mean age: 57.4 years; 64% females) were studied. Results: 38.4% of chagasic stroke patients had asymptomatic T. cruzi infection. Smoking was more frequent in asymptomatic chagasic stroke patients (21.2 vs. 5.7%; p = 0.04). Prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and prior stroke was similar in both groups. Small-vessel infarction (15.6 vs. 3.8%) and large-vessel atherosclerosis (9.4 vs. 3.8%) were significantly more frequent in asymptomatic than in symptomatic T. cruzi-infected stroke patients (p = 0.001). Nevertheless, their frequency was even higher in T. cruzi-noninfected stroke patients (36.7 and 13.3%, respectively). Apical aneurysm (27.3%), left atrial dilatation (12.1%), left ventricle hypokinesia (9.4%) and right bundle branch block (36.4%) were also detected in asymptomatic T. cruzi-infected stroke patients. Conclusions: Ischemic stroke may be the first manifestation of Chagas disease in asymptomatic patients with mild left ventricle dysfunction. Other noncardioembolic stroke subtypes can occur in asymptomatic T. cruzi-infected patients. Copyright © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Previous case-control studies have suggested a causal link between Chagas disease, which is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, and stroke. We investigated the relationship between Chagas disease and long-term stroke mortality in a large community-based cohort of older adults. Methods: Participants were 1398 (80.3% from total) residents aged 60 years in Bambuí City, Brazil. The end point was death from stroke. Potential confounding variables included age, sex, conventional stroke risk factors, and high sensitive C-reactive protein. Results: Participants of this study were followed from 1997 to 2007 leading to 9740 person-years of observation. The baseline prevalence of T. cruzi infection was 37.5% and the overall mortality rate from stroke was 4.62 per 1000 person-years. The risk of death from stroke among T. cruzi-infected participants was twice that of those noninfected (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.25 to 4.44). A B-type natriuretic peptide level in the top quartile was a strong and independent predictor of stroke mortality among those infected (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.25 to 5.91). The presence of both a high B-type natriuretic peptide level and electrocardiographic atrial fibrillation increased the risk of stroke mortality by 11.49 (95% CI, 3.19 to 41.38) in these individuals. Conclusions: This study provides new evidence supporting a causal link between Chagas disease and stroke. The results also showed that B-type natriuretic peptide alone or in association with atrial fibrillation has prognostic value for stroke mortality in T. cruzi chronically infected older adults. © 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - Many proteins of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, contain characteristic arrays of highly repetitive immunogenic amino acid motifs. Diagnostic tests using these motifs in monomeric or dimeric form have proven to provide markedly improved specificity compared to conventional tests based on crude parasite extracts. However, in many cases the available tests still suffer from limited sensitivity. In this study we produced stable synthetic genes with maximal codon variability for the four diagnostic antigens, B13, CRA, TcD, and TcE, each containing between three and nine identical amino acid repeats. These genes were combined by linker sequences encoding short proline-rich peptides, giving rise to a 24-kDa fusion protein which was used as a novel diagnostic antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay setup. Validation of the assay with a large number of well-characterized patient sera from Bolivia and Brazil revealed excellent diagnostic performance. The high sensitivity of the new test may allow future studies to use blood collected by finger prick and dried on filter paper, thus dramatically reducing the costs and effort for the detection of T. cruzi infection.

AB  - CD4- CD8- (double-negative [DN]) T cells have recently been shown to display important immunological functions in human diseases. They express γδ or αβ T-cell receptors that recognize lipid/glycolipid antigens presented via the nonclassical major histocompatibility complex molecules of the CD1 family. We recently demonstrated that while αβ DN T cells serve primarily to express inflammatory cytokines, γδ DN T cells express mainly interleukin-10 (IL-10) in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis. We also demonstrated a correlation between DN T cells and the expression of gamma interferon in the acute phase of Trypanosoma cruzi experimental infection. In this work, we sought to investigate whether αβ or γδ DN T cells display distinct immunoregulatory potentials in patients with polar forms of human Chagas' disease. Our data showed that in vitro infection with T. cruzi leads to expansion of DN T cells in patients with the indeterminate and severe cardiac clinical forms of the disease. However, while αβ DN T cells primarily produce inflammatory cytokines in both forms of the disease, γδ DN T cells display a marked, significant increase in antigen-specific IL-10 expression in indeterminate patients relative to cardiac patients. Finally, higher frequencies of the IL-10-producing γδ DN T cells were correlated with improved clinical measures of cardiac function in the patients, suggesting a protective role for these cells in Chagas' disease. Taken together, these data show distinct functional characteristics for αβ and γδ DN T cells associated with distinct morbidity rates and clinical forms in human Chagas' disease.

AB  - Bioguided fractionation of extract from the leaves of Aristolochia cymbifera led to the isolation of the furofuran lignans fargesin, epieudesmin, and sesamin; the dibenzylbutyrolactone lignans hinokinin and kusunokinin; and an ent-labdane diterpene named copalic acid. Our data demonstrated that copalic acid and kusunokinin were the most active compounds against trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi. Additionally, copalic acid demonstrated the highest parasite selectivity as a result of low toxicity to mammalian cells, despite a considerable hemolytic activity at higher concentrations. Among the isolated compounds, kusunokinin could be considered the most promising candidate, as it displayed significant activity against intracellular amastigotes (IC 50=17μ M) and trypomastigotes (IC50=51μ M) without hemolytic activity. Fargesin, hinokinin, epieudesmin, and sesamin were also effective against trypomastigotes, but these compounds were highly toxic to mammalian cells and no parasite selectivity could be identified. The need for novel drugs for American trypanosomiasis is evident, and these secondary metabolites from A. cymbifera represent a useful tool for drug design. © 2010 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease is a serious social-medical problem in Latin American countries because of its high incidence, morbidity and mortality. Our aim was to identify, from demographic, personal history, clinical and electrocardiographic variables, those that might have independent prognostic value regarding mortality, among a population of chronic Chagas patients from a single endemic area where vector transmission has been halted. Methods and results: Over a mean of 18.5 years, we followed up a prospective cohort of 120 individuals with chronic Chagas disease. Twenty dichotomous variables with prognostic potential for chronic Chagas disease patients were initially evaluated using the Cox model (univariable analysis), to calculate the proportional mortality risk from all causes, cardiovascular causes and sudden death, relative to each variable separately. Of these, 12 variables presenting statistical significance (p < 0.05) were included in a multivariable model to determine which of them would have independent prognostic value regarding mortality. Over the follow-up, there were 42 deaths. Eight variables were proven to be independent prognostic factors for mortality, in relation to the three types of death analysed: age ? 39 years, black skin colour, high-degree right-branch block, anterosuperior division block of the left branch, high-degree right-branch block associated with anterosuperior division block of the left branch, high-degree left-branch block, polymorphic ventricular extrasystoles and PR interval ? 0.16 s. Conclusions: The presence on conventional electrocardiograms of polymorphic ventricular extrasystoles or high-degree left-branch block, among a population of chronic Chagas patients, constitutes the most important independent factor for poor prognosis. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - This work aimed the studies of physicochemical characterization, thermal stability, and compatibility of benznidazole (BNZ) drug by spectroscopy (NMR, IR), thermoanalytical (differential thermal analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetry), and chromatographic (HPLC) techniques, beyond the analytical tools of Van't Hoff equation and Ozawa model. The compatibility study was conducted by binary mixtures (1:1, w/w) of the drug with microcrystalline cellulose 102 and 250, anhydrous lactose, and sodium starch glycolate. The physicochemical characterization confirmed data reported in scientific literature, guaranteeing authenticity of the analyzed raw material. The drug melts at 191.68°C (δH, 119.71 J g-1), characteristic of a non-polymorphic raw material, and a main stage decomposition at 233.76-319.35°C (δm, 43.32%) occurred, ending the study with almost all mass volatilized. The quantification of drug purity demonstrated a correlation of 99.63% between the data obtained by chromatographic (99.20%) and thermoanalytical technique (99.56%). The Arrhenius equation and Ozawa model showed a zero-order kinetic behavior for the drug decomposition, and a calculated provisional validity time was 2.37 years at 25°C. The compatibility study evidenced two possible chemical incompatibilities between BNZ and the tested excipients, both associated by the authors to the reaction of the BNZ's amine and a polymer carbohydrate's carbonile, being maillard reactions. The BNZ reaction with anhydrous lactose is more pronounced than with the sodium starch glycolate because the lactose has more free hydroxyl groups to undergo reduction by the drug. In this sense, this work guides the development of a new solid pharmaceutical product for Chagas disease treatment, with defined quality control parameters and physicochemical stability. © 2010 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.

AB  - The addition of a hydroxymethyl group to the antimicrobial drug nitrofurazone generated hydroxymethylnitrofurazone (NFOH), which had reduced toxicity when its activity against Trypanosoma cruzi was tested in a murine model of Chagas' disease. Four groups of 12 Swiss female mice each received 150 mg of body weight/kg/day of NFOH, 150 mg/kg/day of nitrofurazone (parental compound), 60 mg/kg/day of benznidazole (BZL), or the solvent as a placebo. Treatments were administered orally once a day 6 days a week until the completion of 60 doses. NFOH was as effective as BZL in keeping direct parasitemia at undetectable levels, and PCR results were negative. No histopathological lesions were seen 180 days after completion of the treatments, a time when the levels of anti-T. cruzi antibodies were very low in mice treated with either NFOH or BZL. Nitrofurazone was highly toxic, which led to an overall rate of mortality of 75% and necessitated interruption of the treatment. In contrast, the group treated with its hydroxymethyl derivative, NFOH, displayed the lowest mortality (16%), followed by the BZL (33%) and placebo (66%) groups. The findings of histopathological studies were consistent with these results, with the placebo group showing the most severe parasite infiltrates in skeletal muscle and heart tissue and the NFOH group showing the lowest. The present evidence suggests that NFOH is a promising anti-T. cruzi agent. Copyright © 2010, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Chagas' disease is a global public health problem due to the recent exchange of population between Latin America and other regions, including Europe. The recent development of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for Trypanosoma cruzi infection may improve patient access to diagnosis and care worldwide. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Chagas Stat-Pak RDT in a cohort of undocumented Latin-American migrants living in Geneva, Switzerland. Study participants were enrolled in a primary health care center. The Chagas Stat-Pak test was performed independently on blood and serum samples. A combination of two commercialized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based serological tests was used for comparison (reference standard). A total of 999 adults (median age, 36 years) were included in the study; the majority were women (83%) and originally from Bolivia (47%) or Brazil (25%). A total of 125 participants (12.5%) were diagnosed with T. cruzi infection; with the exception of three individuals, all individuals diagnosed with T. cruzi were originally from Bolivia. The sensitivity and specificity of the Chagas Stat-Pak test on blood samples were 95.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 89.2% to 97.9%) and 99.9% (95% CI, 99.3% to 100%), respectively. When the test was performed on serum samples, the sensitivity was 96% (95% CI, 91% to 98.3%), and the specificity was 99.8% (95% CI, 99.2% to 99.9%). The concordance of test results for blood and serum samples was 99.7%. Both negative and positive predictive values were above 98%. The Chagas Stat-Pak is an accurate diagnostic test for T. cruzi infection among Latin-American migrants living in Europe. The mild deficit in sensitivity should be interpreted in light of its ease of use and capacity to provide immediate results, which allow more people at risk to have access to diagnosis and care both in countries where Chagas' disease is endemic and in countries where this disease is not endemic.

AB  - Chagas' disease, a neglected tropical infection, affects about 18 million people, and 100 million are at risk. The only drug available, benznidazole, is effective in the acute form and in the early chronic form, but its efficacy and tolerance are inversely related to the age of the patients. Side effects are frequent in elderly patients. The search for new drugs is thus warranted. In the present study we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo effect of a cyclopalladated compound (7a) against Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas' disease. The 7a compound inhibits trypomastigote cell invasion, decreases intracellular amastigote proliferation, and is very effective as a trypanocidal drug in vivo, even at very low dosages. It was 340-fold more cytotoxic to parasites than to mammalian cells and was more effective than benznidazole in all in vitro and in vivo experiments. The 7a cyclopalladate complex exerts an apoptosis-like death in T. cruzi trypomastigote forms and causes mitochondrion disruption seen by electron microscopy.

AB  - Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of heart failure in Latin American countries. About 30% of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected individuals develop this severe symptomatic form of the disease, characterized by intense inflammatory response accompanied by fibrosis in the heart.We performed an extensive microarray analysis of hearts from a mouse model of this disease and identified significant alterations in expression of ~12% of the sampled genes. Extensive up-regulations were associated with immune-inflammatory responses (chemokines, adhesion molecules, cathepsins, and major histocompatibility complex molecules) and fibrosis (extracellular matrix components, lysyl oxidase, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1). Our results indicate potentially relevant factors involved in the pathogenesis of the disease that may provide newtherapeutic targets in chronic Chagas disease. © 2010 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

AB  - In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the prognostic value of β-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) for all-cause mortality among persons with Chagas disease, a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. The authors used data on 1,398 participants (37.5% infected with T. cruzi) aged 60 years and over from the Bambuí Cohort Study of Aging in Brazil. From 1997 to 2007, 512 participants died, leading to 12,406 person-years of observation. The hazard ratio for death was 1.27 for each unit of log-transformed BNP level (95% confidence interval (CI: 1.11, 1.45) among infected persons, independent of potentially confounding factors. Infected persons with baseline BNP levels in the top quartile had a risk of death twice that of persons in the bottom quartile (hazard ratio = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.29, 3.32). The discriminatory ability of BNP in predicting mortality (C = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.66, 0.71) was similar to that of an electrocardiogram (C = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.71), with reasonably stable risk discrimination over time. BNP is a strong predictor of mortality in older adults with Chagas disease. Although the usefulness of BNP for risk stratification in this parasitic disease remains a topic of debate, this study found that BNP-based risk discrimination is at least comparable to that of an electrocardiogram. © 2010 The Author.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to establish the prevalence of Chagas' disease among HIV seropositive patients and to define the clinical profile of co-infected cases. Cross-sectional study: the prevalence of co-infected subjects was 1.3% and there was no significant difference between co-infected and non co-infected patients relative to race, birthplace, home address and CD4 T cells. The co-infected group comprised predominantly women and mean age and median viral load were higher. Longitudinal study: included 20 patients (12 women) and described the clinical presentation and natural history of concomitant infections. The mean follow-up time was 35.8 months, mean age was 43 ± 8.7 years and 60% of patients were white. During the follow-up, a total of 113 serological tests for Chagas' disease were performed: 89 (78.8%) were reactive/positive, 21 (18.6%) were doubtful and three (2.6%) were non-reactive/negative. Positive results for xenodiagnosis were high (81%). At the baseline evaluation, thirteen patients had the indeterminate form of Chagas' disease and seven cardiopathy. One patient developed from indeterminate to digestive form, three had a reactivation of Chagas' disease in the central nervous system, all had parasitological confirmation and received specific treatment. There were 11 deaths. Thus, HIV-infected patients should be tested for Chagas' disease when epidemiologically relevant. © 2010 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

AB  - Chagas' disease, a neglected tropical illness for which current therapy is unsatisfactory, is caused by the intracellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The goal of this work is to investigate the in vitro and in vivo effects of the arylimidamide (AIA) DB766 against T. cruzi. This arylimidamide exhibits strong trypanocidal activity and excellent selectivity for bloodstream trypomastigotes and intracellular amastigotes (Y strain), giving IC50s (drug concentrations that reduce 50% of the number of the treated parasites) of 60 and 25 nM, respectively. DB766 also exerts striking effects upon different parasite stocks, including those naturally resistant to benznidazole, and displays higher activity in vitro than the reference drugs. By fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy analyses, we found that this AIA localizes in DNA-enriched compartments and induces considerable damage to the mitochondria. DB766 effectively reduces the parasite load in the blood and cardiac tissue and presents efficacy similar to that of benznidazole in mouse models of T. cruzi infection employing the Y and Colombian strains, using oral and intraperitoneal doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day that were given after the establishment of parasite infection. This AIA ameliorates electrocardiographic alterations, reduces hepatic and heart lesions induced by the infection, and provides 90 to 100% protection against mortality, which is similar to that provided by benznidazole. Our data clearly show the trypanocidal efficacy of DB766, suggesting that this AIA may represent a new lead compound candidate to Chagas' disease treatment.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is highly diverse genetically and has been partitioned into six discrete typing units (DTUs), recently re-named T. cruzi I-VI. Although T. cruzi reproduces predominantly by binary division, accumulating evidence indicates that particular DTUs are the result of hybridization events. Two major scenarios for the origin of the hybrid lineages have been proposed. It is accepted widely that the most heterozygous TcV and TcVI DTUs are the result of genetic exchange between TcII and TcIII strains. On the other hand, the participation of a TcI parental in the current genome structure of these hybrid strains is a matter of debate. Here, sequences of the T. cruzi-specific 195-bp satellite DNA of TcI, TcII, TcIII, TcV, and TcVI strains have been used for inferring network genealogies. The resulting genealogy showed a high degree of reticulation, which is consistent with more than one event of hybridization between the Tc DTUs. The data also strongly suggest that TcIII is a hybrid with two distinct sets of satellite sequences, and that genetic exchange between TcI and TcII parentals occurred within the pedigree of the TcV and TcVI DTUs. Although satellite DNAs belong to the fast-evolving portion of eukaryotic genomes, in >100 satellite units of nine T. cruzi strains we found regions that display 100% identity. No DTU-specific consensus motifs were identified, inferring species-wide conservation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Transfusion transmitted Chagas disease was recognized as a medical problem more than 50 years ago. However, little attention was paid to it by Transfusion Medicine, medical authorities or regulatory agencies as a major problem and threat (especially after the advent of HIV/AIDS); perhaps because it was mainly restricted to tropical regions, usually in less developed countries. With the intense human migratory movement from developing to developed countries, it became more common and evident. The scope of this review is to cover the main transfusional aspects of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease), including the main strategies to prevent it through donor questionnaires, specific serological testing and alternative methods such as leukofiltration and pathogen reduction procedures, in order to increase the blood safety in both developing and developed countries. © 2009.

AB  - Little is known about the importance of capybara, Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, as reservoirs for parasites of zoonotic or veterinary importance. Sera from 63 capybaras, from 6 counties in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, were examined for antibodies to Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania infantum, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, Sarcocystis neurona, and Neospora caninum using an indirect immunofluorescent antibody test. Five (8%) of the 63 capybaras had antibodies to T. cruzi epimastigotes. None of the samples from capybara reacted positively with L. infantum promastigotes or with spores of E. cuniculi. Two (3%) of the serum samples were positive for antibodies to S. neurona merozoites, and 2 (3%) of the serum samples were positive for antibodies to N. caninum tachyzoites. A serum sample from 1 capybara was positive for antibodies to both T. cruzi and N. caninum. None of the remaining 62 samples reacted with more than 1 parasite. © 2010 American Society of Parasitologists.

AB  - In 2006, Brazilian government received the international certificate of interruption of the vectorial transmission of Chagas' disease. However, outbreaks reported in Brazilian Amazon rainforest bear a regular occurrence and represents a relevant regional epidemiological gauge. The wild life cycle of the Chagas' disease transmission (i.e., triatomine-marsupial cycle) is present outside the previously reported endemic belt, ubiquitously, as infective triatomines can be demonstrated in Palm trees widespread all over the Amazon rainforest. As humans invade the rainforest, one is incidentally caught up and further becomes' an active part of American trypanosomiasis wild life cycle. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined the extent to which different Trypanosoma cruzi strains induce transcriptomic changes in cultured L6E9 myoblasts 72 hours after infection with Brazil (TC I), Y (TC II), CL (TC II), and Tulahuen (TC II) strains. Expression of 6,289 distinct, fully annotated unigenes was quantified with 27,000 rat oligonucleotide arrays in each of the four replicas of all control and infected RNA samples. Considering changes greater than 1.5-fold and P values &lt; 0.05, the Tulahuen strain was the most disruptive to host transcriptome (17% significantly altered genes), whereas the Y strain altered only 6% of the genes. The significantly altered genes in the infected cells were largely different among the strains, and only 21 genes were similarly changed by all four strains. However, myoblasts infected with different strains showed proportional overall gene-expression alterations. These results indicate that infection with different parasite strains modulates similar but not identical pathways in the host cells.

AB  - From a series of 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-arylhydrazone derivatives of megazol screened in vitro against Trypanosoma cruzi, eight (S1 to S8) were selected for in vivo screening by single-dose oral administration (200 mg/kg of body weight) to infected mice at 5 days postinfection (dpi). Based on significant decreases in both parasitemia levels and mortality rates, S2 and S3 were selected for further assays. Despite having no in vivo effect, S1 was included since it was 2-fold more potent against trypomastigotes than megazol in vitro. Trypomastigotes treated with S1, S2, or S3 showed alterations of the flagellar structure and of the nuclear envelope. When assayed on intracellular amastigotes, the selectivity index (SI) for macrophages was in the range of >27 to >63 and for cardiac cells was >32 for S1 and >48 for megazol. In noninfected mice, S1 did not alter the levels of glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT), or urea. S2 led to an increase in GOT, S3 to increases in GOT and GPT, and megazol to an increase in GOT. Infected mice were treated with each derivative at 50 and 100 mg/kg from dpi 6 to 15: S1 did not interfere with the course of infection or reduce the number of inflammatory foci in the cardiac tissue, S2 led to a significant decrease of parasitemia, and S3 decreased mortality. There was no direct correlation between the in vitro effect on trypomastigotes and amastigotes and the results of the treatment in experimental models, as S1 showed a high potency in vitro while, in two different schemes of in vivo treatment, no decrease of parasitemia or mortality was observed.

AB  - Upon activation, cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes are desialylated exposing β-galactose residues in a physiological change that enhances their effector activity and that can be monitored on the basis of increased binding of the lectin peanut agglutinin. Herein, we investigated the impact of sialylation mediated by trans-sialidase, a specific and unique Trypanosoma transglycosylase for sialic acid, on CD8+ T cell response of mice infected with T. cruzi. Our data demonstrate that T. cruzi uses its trans-sialidase enzyme to resialylate the CD8+ T cell surface, thereby dampening antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response that might favor its own persistence in the mammalian host. Binding of the monoclonal antibody S7, which recognizes sialic acid-containing epitopes on the 115-kDa isoform of CD43, was augmented on CD8+ T cells from ST3Gal-I-deficient infected mice, indicating that CD43 is one sialic acid acceptor for trans-sialidase activity on the CD8+ T cell surface. The cytotoxic activity of antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells against the immunodominant trans-sialidase synthetic peptide IYNVGQVSI was decreased following active trans-sialidase-mediated resialylation in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of the parasite's native trans-sialidase activity during infection strongly decreased CD8+ T cell sialylation, reverting it to the glycosylation status expected in the absence of parasite manipulation increasing mouse survival. Taken together, these results demonstrate, for the first time, that T. cruzi subverts sialylation to attenuate CD8+ T cell interactions with peptide-major histocompatibility complex class I complexes. CD8+ T cell resialylation may represent a sophisticated strategy to ensure lifetime host parasitism. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: A liver transplantation is the first choice of treatment for patients with hepatic insufficiency due to chronic diseases. Infections in the postoperative period represent one of the main causes of mortality in these cases. However, few articles have evaluated the predominance of certain infectious diseases and their influence on postoperative mortality. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 236 patients who underwent liver transplantation from January 1997 to January 2007. In these records we checked the serological profiles for these diseases: toxoplasmosis, syphilis, human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV) I and II infection, Chagas disease, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, paracoccidioidomycosis, tuberculosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]). The statistical analysis was performed by table frequencies. Results: CMV showed positivity (CMV-IgG) in 94.7% of patients, 95.8% for EBV, 33.3% for toxoplasmosis, 47.9% for hepatitis C, and 5% for hepatitis B. Conclusion: Our analysis showed the importance of serological investigations and diagnostic examinations before the transplantation procedure, seeking to minimize possible reactivation of the disease after the use of immunosuppression drugs, particularly in the first 6 months after transplantation, or even to avoid a primary infection. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The successful elimination of vectorial and transfusional transmission of Chagas' disease from some countries is a result of the reduction of domestic density of the primary vector Triatoma infestans, of almost 100% of coverage in blood serological selection and to the fact that the basic reproductive number of Chagas' disease is very close to one (1.25). Therefore, congenital transmission is currently the only way of acquiring Chagas' Disease in such regions. In this paper we propose a model of congenital transmission of Chagas' disease. Its aim is to provide an estimation of the time period it will take to eliminate this form of transmission in regions where vetorial transmission was reduced to close to zero, like in Brazil. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Interspecies DNA transfer is a major biological process leading to the accumulation of mutations inherited by sexual reproduction among eukaryotes. Lateral DNA transfer events and their inheritance has been challenging to document. In this study we modified a thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR by using additional targeted primers, along with Southern blots, fluorescence techniques, and bioinformatics, to identify lateral DNA transfer events from parasite to host. Instances of naturally occurring human infections by Trypanosoma cruzi are documented, where mitochondrial minicircles integrated mainly into retrotransposable LINE-1 of various chromosomes. The founders of five families show minicircle integrations that were transferred vertically to their progeny. Microhomology end-joining of 6 to 22 AC-rich nucleotide repeats in the minicircles and host DNA mediates foreign DNA integration. Heterogeneous minicircle sequences were distributed randomly among families, with diversity increasing due to subsequent rearrangement of inserted fragments. Mosaic recombination and hitchhiking on retrotransposition events to different loci were more prevalent in germ line as compared to somatic cells. Potential new genes, pseudogenes, and knockouts were identified. A pathway of minicircle integration and maintenance in the host genome is suggested. Thus, infection by T. cruzi has the unexpected consequence of increasing human genetic diversity, and Chagas disease may be a fortuitous share of negative selection. This demonstration of contemporary transfer of eukaryotic DNA to the human genome and its subsequent inheritance by descendants introduces a significant change in the scientific concept of evolutionary biology and medicine. © 2010 Hecht et al.

AB  - An effective innate immune recognition of the intracellular protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is critical for host resistance against Chagas disease, a severe and chronic illness that affects millions of people in Latin America. In this study, we evaluated the participation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (Nod)-like receptor proteins in host response to T. cruzi infection and found that Nod1-dependent, but not Nod2-dependent, responses are required for host resistance against infection. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from Nod1-/- mice showed an impaired induction of NF-κB-dependent products in response to infection and failed to restrict T. cruzi infection in presence of IFN-γ. Despite normal cytokine production in the sera, Nod1-/- mice were highly susceptible to T. cruzi infection, in a similar manner to MyD88-/- and NO synthase 2-/- mice. These studies indicate that Nod1-dependent responses account for host resistance against T. cruzi infection by mechanisms independent of cytokine production.

AB  - Background: Migration of Latin Americans to the USA, Canada and Europe has modified Chagas disease distribution, but data on imported cases and on risks of local transmission remain scarce. We assessed the prevalence and risk factors for Chagas disease, staged the disease and evaluated attitudes towards blood transfusion and organ transplant among Latin American migrants in Geneva, Switzerland. Methodology/Principal Findings: This cross-sectional study included all consecutive Latin American migrants seeking medical care at a primary care facility or attending two Latino churches. After completing a questionnaire, they were screened for Chagas disease with two serological tests (Biomérieux ELISA cruzi; Biokit Bioelisa Chagas). Infected subjects underwent a complete medical work-up. Predictive factors for infection were assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.1012 persons (females: 83%; mean age: 37.2 [SD 11.3] years, Bolivians: 48% [n = 485]) were recruited. 96% had no residency permit. Chagas disease was diagnosed with two positive serological tests in 130 patients (12.8%; 95%CI 10.8%-14.9%), including 127 Bolivians (26.2%; 95%CI 22.3%-30.1%). All patients were in the chronic phase, including 11.3% with cardiac and 0.8% with digestive complications. Predictive factors for infection were Bolivian origin (OR 33.2; 95%CI 7.5-147.5), reported maternal infection with T. cruzi (OR 6.9; 95%CI 1.9-24.3), and age older than 35 years (OR 6.7; 95%CI 2.4-18.8). While 22 (16.9%) infected subjects had already donated blood, 24 (18.5%) and 34 (26.2%) considered donating blood and organs outside Latin America, respectively. Conclusions: Chagas disease is highly prevalent among Bolivian migrants in Switzerland. Chronic cardiac and digestive complications were substantial. Screening of individuals at risk should be implemented in nonendemic countries and must include undocumented migrants. © 2010 Jackson et al.

AB  - The Triatominae are distributed in Brazilian regions and are the vector of Chagas disease. This group is also characterized by lower karyotype variability, occurrence of holokinetic chromosomes and inverted meiosis of the sex chromosomes. In this study, we determined the karyotype of four species of the genus Triatoma Laporte, 1832 using chromosome measurement, chromosome banding and FISH with a 45S rDNA probe. All samples showed 2n = 20A+XY with chromosomes sorted by size in decreasing order. Heterochromatin of Triatoma infestans melanosoma Lent, Jurberg, Galvão, Carcavallo, 1994 is distributed among eight autosomes and the sex chromosomes. In Triatoma brasiliensis Neiva, 1911, T. matogrossensis Leite, Barbosa, 1953 and T. rubrovaria Blanchard, 1834, heterochromatin was restricted to the Y chromosome, which was characterized as DAPI+ (weak signal). FISH using a 45S rDNA probe of Drosophila melanogaster Meigen, 1830 showed differences in the number and location of hybridization sites. T. brasiliensis and T. rubrovaria showed the signal on one autosome pair. T. matogrossensis showed signals on both sex chromosomes, and T. infestans melanosoma only on the X chromosome. Conventional banding analysis suggests a closer relationship between T. brasiliensis, T. matogrossensis and T. rubrovaria, except with regard to 45S rDNA location in T. matogrossensis, and a more differentiated karyotype in T. infestans melanosoma. © Comparative Cytogenetics.

AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine digoxin serum concentrations in patients with Chagas' cardiomyopathy with chronic heart failure, because little is known concerning this laboratory test in patients with this condition. Methods: This study focuses on 29 (29%) out of 101 patients with chronic heart failure secondary to Chagas' cardiomyopathy receiving digoxin therapy. Digoxin was measured by the immune-enzymatic method. Results: New York Heart Association Functional Class III/IV was noted in 13 (45%) patients. The mean potassium serum level was 4.3± 0.5mEq/L, mean creatinine serum levels 1.4± 0.3dg/100ml, and left ventricular ejection fraction 34.7± 13.8%. The median digoxin serum level was 1.27 (0.55; 1.79)ng/ml. Sixteen (55%) patients had digoxin serum levels higher than 1.0ng/ml. Abnormal digoxin serum levels were verified in 13 (45%) patients. Digoxin serum levels correlated moderately with creatinine serum levels (r = 0.39; p= 0.03) and negatively with sodium serum levels (r= -0.38; p= 0.03). Conclusions: Digoxin serum concentration should be measured in patients with Chagas' cardiomyopathy with chronic heart failure receiving digoxin therapy due to the potential for digoxin toxicity.

AB  - Introduction: To evaluate physical capacity as determined by the six-minute walk test (6MWT) in patients with chronic heart failure due to Chagas' disease associated with systemic arterial hypertension (Chagas-SAH). Methods: A total of 98 patients routinely followed at the Cardiomyopathy Outpatient Service were recruited. Of these, 60 (61%) were diagnosed with Chagas disease and 38 (39%) with Chagas-SAH. Results: The distance walked during 6 min was 357.9 ±98 m for Chagas-SAH patients and 395.8 ± 121m for Chagas cardiomyopathy patients (p >0.05). In patients with Chagas-SAH, a negative correlation occurred between the 6MWT and the total score of the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (r= -0.51; p=0.001). No other correlations were determined between 6MWT values and continuous variables in patients with Chagas-SAH. Conclusions: The results of the 6MWT in Chagas-SAH patients are similar to those verified in Chagas cardiomyopathy patients with chronic heart failure. Coexistence of SAH does not seem to affect the functional capacity of Chagas cardiomyopathy patients with chronic heart failure.

AB  - In the chronic phase of Chagas disease, individuals infected by Trypanosoma cruzi may be asymptomatic or may present cardiac and/or digestive complications. Our aim here was to analyze the relationship between the presence of specific immunoglobulin A antibodies and the different chronic clinical forms of Chagas disease using two recombinant antigens of Trypanosoma cruzi, cytoplasmatic repetitive antigen and flagellar repetitive antigen. The association of this immunoglobulin isotype with the digestive and cardio-digestive forms of the disease determined by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, strongly suggests that IgA antibodies against these recombinant antigens of T. cruzi can be used as an immunological marker of the digestive alterations caused by Chagas disease. The tests performed in this study show that it is possible to differentiate digestive forms of Chagas disease. The knowledge provided by these results may help physicians to manage early alterations in the digestive tract of patients with the indeterminate or cardiac forms of Chagas disease. Prospective studies, however, with follow-up of the patients that presenting with high levels of immunoglobulin A against cytoplasmatic repetitive antigen and flagellar repetitive antigen recombinant antigens, need to be conducted to confirm this hypothesis. © 2010 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.

AB  - On the American continent, almost 15 million people are affected by Chagas disease, resulting in important economic and social damages. Dogs are considered to be an excellent experimental model to study Chagas' disease; as a result, in this research, the characterization of cardiovascular abnormalities was performed in dogs experimentally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi (the Colombian strain) that were at chronic stage. Thirteen adult female dogs were evaluated by electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, hematological and biochemical analyses in the chronic phase. For the electrocardiographic studies, respiratory sinus arrhythmia was the predominant rhythm during the entire research period (49.55% to 67%), with a low prevalence of right bundle branch block (0-13%) and first-degree atrioventricular block (0-14%). The spectral Doppler echocardiography showed E and A mitral wave reversal (0.71±0.17), confirming the diastolic dysfunction present in all dogs. An increase in the enzymes activities was detected in the serum analysis, indicating myocardial injury by the infection. Six dogs died during the follow-up. In this way, the clinical characterization of experimentally infected dogs, as described here, increases the knowledge and allows for recognition of the behavioural modifications present in Chagas' disease in affected dogs.

AB  - Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) catalyzes the first step of the pentose-phosphate pathway which supplies cells with ribose 5-phosphate (R5P) and NADPH. R5P is the precursor for the biosynthesis of nucleotides while NADPH is the cofactor of several dehydrogenases acting in a broad range of biosynthetic processes and in the maintenance of the cellular redox state. RNA interference-mediated reduction of G6PDH levels in bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei validated this enzyme as a drug target against Human African Trypanosomiasis. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a human steroidal pro-hormone and its derivative 16α-bromoepiandrosterone (16BrEA) are uncompetitive inhibitors of mammalian G6PDH. Such steroids are also known to enhance the immune response in a broad range of animal infection models. It is noteworthy that the administration of DHEA to rats infected by Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Human American Trypanosomiasis (also known as Chagas' disease), reduces blood parasite levels at both acute and chronic infection stages. In the present work, we investigated the in vitro effect of DHEA derivatives on the proliferation of T. cruzi epimastigotes and their inhibitory effect on a recombinant form of the parasite's G6PDH (TcG6PDH). Our results show that DHEA and its derivative epiandrosterone (EA) are uncompetitive inhibitors of TcG6PDH, with Ki values of 21.5 ± 0.5 and 4.8 ± 0.3 μM, respectively. Results from quantitative inhibition assays indicate 16BrEA as a potent inhibitor of TcG6PDH with an IC50 of 86 ± 8 nM and those from in vitro cell viability assays confirm its toxicity for T. cruzi epimastigotes, with a LD50 of 12 ± 8 μM. In summary, we demonstrated that, in addition to host immune response enhancement, 16BrEA has a direct effect on parasite viability, most likely as a consequence of TcG6PDH inhibition. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, we investigated the in vivo activity of ravuconazole against the Y and Berenice-78 Trypanosoma cruzi strains using acutely infected dogs as hosts. Ravuconazole was well tolerated, as no significant side effects were observed during the treatment using 6.0 mg/kg twice a day (12 mg/kg/day) for up to 90 days. In all treated animals, parasitemia was permanently suppressed by the first day of treatment, independently of the parasite strain. Cultures of blood obtained posttreatment were negative for 90% of the animals, confirming that the drug induced a marked reduction in the parasite load. The results of PCR tests for T. cruzi in blood performed 1 month posttreatment were consistently negative for three of five and two of five animals infected with the Y and Berenice-78 strains, respectively. All ravuconazole-treated dogs consistently had negative serological test results during and until 30 days after treatment, regardless of the therapeutic scheme used. However, after the end of treatment, an increase in specific antibody levels was observed in all treated animals, although the antibody levels were always significantly lower than those of the nontreated control dogs. Despite being unable to induce a parasitological cure, ravuconazole treatment led to significant reductions in the levels of gamma interferon expression and lesions in cardiac tissues in animals infected with the Y strain, while the level of interleukin-10 mRNA expression increased. We conclude that ravuconazole has potent suppressive but not curative activity in the canine model of acute Chagas' disease, probably due to its unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties (half-life, 8.8 h). The longer half-life of ravuconazole in humans (4 to 8 days) makes it a promising drug for assessment for use as chemotherapy in human Chagas' disease.

AB  - Chagas' disease, a parasitic infection widely distributed throughout Latin America, is a major public health problem with devastating consequences in terms of human morbidity and mortality. The enzyme cruzain is the major cysteine protease from Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of American trypanosomiasis or Chagas' disease, and has been selected as an attractive target for the development of novel trypanocidal drugs. In the present work, we describe the synthesis and inhibitory effects of a series of thirty-three chalcone and seven hydrazide derivatives against the enzyme cruzain from T. cruzi. Most of the compounds showed promising in vitro inhibition (IC50 values in the range of 20-60 μM), which suggest the potential of these compounds as lead candidates for further development. Twelve compounds have not been reported before, and four of them (7, 13, 16 e 18) are among the most potent inhibitors of the series. © 2010 Sociedade Brasileira de Química.

AB  - Background-Peculiar aspects of Chagas cardiomyopathy raise concerns about efficacy and safety of sympathetic blockade. We studied the influence of β-blockers in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. Methods and Results-We examined REMADHE trial and grouped patients according to etiology (Chagas versus non-Chagas) and β-blocker therapy. Primary end point was all-cause mortality or heart transplantation. Altogether 456 patients were studied; 27 (5.9%) were submitted to heart transplantation and 202 (44.3%) died. Chagas etiology was present in 68 (14.9%) patients; they had lower body mass index (24.1±4.1 versus 26.3±5.1, P=0.001), smaller end-diastolic left ventricle diameter (6.7±1.0 mm versus 7.0±0.9 mm, P=0.001), smaller proportion of β-blocker therapy (35.8% versus 68%, P<0.001), and higher proportion of spironolactone therapy (74.6% versus 57.8%, P=0.003). Twenty-four (35.8%) patients with Chagas disease were under β-blocker therapy and had lower serum sodium (136.6±3.1 versus 138.4±3.1 mEqs, P=0.05) and lower body mass index (22.5±3.3 versus 24.9±4.3, P=0.03) compared with those who received β-blockers. Survival was lower in patients with Chagas heart disease as compared with other etiologies. When only patients under β-blockers were considered, the survival of patients with Chagas disease was similar to that of other etiologies. The survival of patients with β-blockers was higher than that of patients without β-blockers. In Cox regression model, left ventricle end-diastolic diameter (hazard ratio, 1.78; CI, 1.15 to 2.76; P=0.009) and β-blockers (hazard ratio, 0.37; CI, 0.14 to 0.97; P=0.044) were associated with better survival. Conclusions-Our study suggests that β-blockers may have beneficial effects on survival of patients with heart failure and Chagas heart disease and warrants further investigation in a prospective, randomized trial.

AB  - A cross-sectional study was carried out in Água Comprida, MG, Brazil, a region previously endemic to Chagas disease whose vectorial transmission was interrupted around 20 year ago. A total of 998 individuals were examined for anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies. Seropositivity was observed in 255 subjects (25.5%), and 743 subjects were negative. Forty-one families with 5-80 individuals with similar environmental conditions were selected for familial analysis. In 15 families, seropositivity to T. cruzi was observed in > 50% of individuals. The segregation analysis confirmed family aggregation for the seropositivity to the T. cruzi. Heart commitment was the major clinical form observed, and in six families, > 50% of the individuals display cardiopathy that may be attributed to T. cruzi infection. Our results support the hypothesis that there is a family aggregation for the seropositivity but without the effect of one major gene.

AB  - Background/Aim: Chagas' disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and occurs in most Latin American countries. The protozoan may colonize the central nervous system (CNS) of immune-compromised human hosts, thus causing neuronal disorders. Systemic control of the intracellular forms of the parasite greatly depends on the establishment of a TH1 response and subsequent nitric oxide (NO) release. At the CNS, it is known that low concentrations of NO promote neuronal survival and growth, while high concentrations exert toxic effects and neuron death. Accounting for NO production by astrocytes is the glia-derived factor S100β, which is overproduced in some neurodegenerative diseases. In the current work, we studied the expression of NO, interferon (IFN)-γ and S100β in the spinal cord tissue of IL-12p40KO mice infected with T. cruzi, a model of neurodegenerative process. Methods: IL-12p40KO and wild-type (WT) female mice infected with T. cruzi Sylvio X10/4 (105 trypomastigotes, intraperitoneally) were euthanized when IL-12p40KO individuals presented limb paralysis. Spinal cord sections were submitted to immunohistochemical procedures for localization of neurofilament, laminin, nitrotyrosine, NO synthases (NOS), IFN-γ and S100β. The total number of neurons was estimated by stereological analysis and the area and intensity of immunoreactivities were assessed by microdensitometric/morphometric image analysis. Results: No lesion was found in the spinal cord sections of WT mice, while morphological disarrangements, many inflammatory foci, enlarged vessels, amastigote nests and dying neurons were seen at various levels of IL-12p40KO spinal cord. Compared to WT mice, IL-12p40KO mice presented a decrement on total number of neurons (46.4%, p &lt; 0.05) and showed increased values of immunoreactive area for nitrotyrosine (239%, p &lt; 0.01) and NOS (544%, p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the intensity of nitrotyrosine (16%, p &lt; 0.01), NOS (38%, p &lt; 0.05) and S100β (21%, p &lt; 0.001) immunoreactivities were also augmented. No IFN-γ-labeled cells were seen in WT spinal cord tissue, contrary to IL-12p40KO tissue that displayed inflammatory infiltrating cells and also some parenchymal cells positively labeled. Conclusion: We suggest that overproduction of NO may account for neuronal death at the spinal cord of T. cruzi-infected IL-12p40KO mice and that IFN-γ and S100β may contribute to NOS activation in the absence of IL-12. © 2009 S.
