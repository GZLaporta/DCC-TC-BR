AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and it is mainly acquired through the vector route, however, blood transfusion and congenital transmission are implicated in the spread of the illness worldwide. The congenital route can occur at any stage of pregnancy and its frequency varies. In the Federal District, in Brazil, the frequency of T. cruzi infection in pregnant women and their offspring has not been updated. Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in pregnant women and the rate of congenital transmission in the Federal District. A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of T. cruzi from 2014 to 2016 in the population of pregnant women attended by the public health service throughout the Federal District and a descriptive cohort for the evaluation of congenital transmission. During the study, prenatal data of 98,895 women were consulted and pregnant women registered in 2016, presenting with positive T. cruzi serology, were part of the descriptive cohort. The estimated prevalence of T. cruzi infection in the three years was 0.19% and the congenital transmission rate was 1/40 (2.5%). Our results have shown that, although the main routes of transmission of CD have been interrupted, there is still a risk of congenital transmission in the Federal District. This present study highlights the need for the continuous implementation of a screening program for pregnant women and timely treatment of infected newborns and children.

AB  - Background. Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, can be transmitted to the offspring of infected women, which constitutes an epidemiologically significant parasite transmission route in nonendemic areas. It is relevant to evaluate differentially expressed factors in T. cruzi-infected pregnant women as potential markers of Chagas congenital transmission.
   Methods. Circulating levels of 12 cytokines and chemokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or cytometric bead array in T. cruzi-infected and uninfected pregnant women in their second trimester of pregnancy and control groups of T. cruzi-infected and uninfected nonpregnant women.
   Results. Trypanosoma cruzi-infected women showed a proinflammatory Th1-biased profile, with increased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-12p70, IL-15, and monokine induced by interferon-gamma (MIG). Uninfected pregnant women presented a biased response towards Th2/Th17/Treg profiles, with increased plasma levels of IL-5, IL-6, IL-1 beta, IL-17A, and IL-10. Finally, we identified that high parasitemia together with low levels of TNF-alpha, IL-15, and IL-17, low TNF-alpha/IL-10 ratio, and high IL-12p70 levels are factors associated with an increased probability of Chagas congenital transmission.
   Conclusions. Trypanosoma cruzi-infected pregnant women who did not transmit the infection to their babies exhibited a distinct proinflammatory cytokine profile that might serve as a potential predictive marker of congenital transmission.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease is endemic in Latin America and affects 8 million people worldwide. In 2010, Catalonia introduced systematic public health surveillance to detect and treat congenital Chagas disease. Aim: The objective was to evaluate the health outcomes of the congenital Chagas disease screening programme during the first 6 years (2010-2015) after its introduction in Catalonia. Methods: In a surveillance system, we screened pregnant women and newborns and other children of positive mothers, and treated Chagas-positive newborns and children. Diagnosis was confirmed for pregnant women and children with two positive serological tests and for newborns with microhaematocrit and/or PCR at birth or serology at age 9 months. Results: From 2010 to 2015, the estimated screening coverage rate increased from 68.4% to 88.6%. In this period, 33,469 pregnant women were tested for Trypanosoma cruzi and 937 positive cases were diagnosed. The overall prevalence was 2.8 cases per loo pregnancies per year (15.8 in Bolivian women). We followed 82.8% of newborns until serological testing at age 9-12 months and 28 were diagnosed with Chagas disease (congenital transmission rate: 4.17%). Of 518 siblings, 178 (34.3%) were tested and 14 (7.8%) were positive for T. cruzi. Having other children with Chagas disease and the heart clinical form of Chagas disease were maternal risk factors associated with congenital T. cruzi infection (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The increased screening coverage rate indicates consolidation of the programme in Catalonia. The rate of Chagas disease congenital transmission in Catalonia is in accordance with the range in non-endemic countries.

AB  - ObjectivesTo determine the seroprevalence of Chagas disease among pregnant women and estimate the risk factors for Chagas disease during pregnancies.
   MethodsCommunity-based serological tests on Trypanosoma cruzi and structured interviews on socio-demographic and socio-economic status were conducted with pregnant women registered at three health centres in Sonsonate province, El Salvador.
   ResultsOf 797 pregnant women participating in the study, 29 (3.6%) were infected with Chagas disease. None had clinical symptoms. The results of bivariate analyses showed the significant association between seropositivity and maternal age 35years, anaemia, illiteracy, having no formal school education and having knowledge on Chagas disease (P<0.05). The results of multivariate analysis indicate that age 35years and anaemia were significantly associated with being infected with Chagas disease among pregnant women (OR=3.541 and 5.197, respectively).
   ConclusionWe recommend that the national Chagas disease control programme be better coordinated with the national maternal and child health programme to introduce blood screening for T.cruzi during antenatal visits. If financial constraint allows systematic blood screening to be only partially implemented, resources should be focused on pregnant women 35years and women who have anaemia.
   ObjectifsDeterminer la seroprevalence de la maladie de Chagas chez les femmes enceintes et estimer les facteurs de risque de la maladie pendant la grossesse.
   MethodesDes tests serologiques pour Trypanosoma cruzi et des entretiens structures sur base communautaire sur la situation demographique et socioeconomique ont ete menes avec les femmes enceintes enregistrees dans trois centres de sante dans la province de Sonsonate, a El Salvador.
   ResultatsSur 797 femmes enceintes participant a l'etude, 29 (3,6%) etaient infectees par la maladie de Chagas. Aucune ne presentait des symptomes cliniques. L'analyse bivariee a montre une association entre la seropositivite maternelle et l'age 35 ans, l'anemie, l'analphabetisme, le manque d'education scolaire officielle et les connaissances sur la maladie de Chagas avec une signification statistique (p <0,05). Les resultats de l'analyse multivariee indiquent que l'age 35 ans et l'anemie etaient significativement associes a l'infection par la maladie de Chagas chez les femmes enceintes (OR = 3,541 et 5,197, respectivement).
   ConclusionNous recommandons que le programme national de lutte contre la maladie de Chagas soit mieux coordonne avec le programme national de sante maternelle et infantile afin d'introduire le depistage sanguin de T. cruzi au cours des visites prenatales. Si les contraintes financieres ne permettent que l'implementation partielle du depistage sanguin systematique, les ressources devraient etre axees sur les femmes enceintes 35 ans et celles avec une anemie.
   ObjetivosDeterminar la seroprevalencia de la enfermedad de Chagas en mujeres embarazadas y calcular los factores de riesgo de sufrirla durante el embarazo.
   MetodosSe realizaron pruebas serologicas para Trypanosoma cruzi a nivel comunitario y entrevistas estructuradas con las mujeres embarazadas registradas en tres centros sanitarios de la provincia de Sonsonate, en El Salvador, para determinar su estatus demografico y socioeconomico.
   ResultadosDe 797 mujeres embarazadas que participaron en el estudio, 29 (3.6%) estaban infectadas. Ninguna presentaba sintomas clinicos. Un analisis bivariado mostro una asociacion entre la seropositividad y una edad materna 35 anos, anemia, analfabetismo, no tener educacion escolar formal y tener conocimientos sobre la enfermedad de Chagas con significancia estadistica (p<0.05). Los resultados del analisis multivariado indicaban que, entre las mujeres embarazadas, tener una edad de 35 anos y padecer anemia estaban significativamente asociados con estar infectada con T.cruzi (OR=3.541 y OR=5.197 respectivamente).
   ConclusionHemos recomendado que se mejore la coordinacion entre el programa nacional para la enfermedad de Chagas y el programa nacional de salud materno-infantil, con el fin de introducir un cribado sistematico en sangre para T. cruzi durante las visitas prenatales. Si las limitaciones financieras solo permiten que el cribado sistematico en sangre se implemente parcialmente, los recursos deberian destinarse a mujeres embarazadas 35 anos y a mujeres con anemia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with Chagas disease in pregnant women in an endemic area of Santander, Colombia.
   METHODS Cross-sectional study included 23 municipalities of Santander, Colombia. Serological IFAT and ELISA tests were undertaken to detect IgG anti-Trypanosoma cruzi. A questionnaire was conducted for assessing the risk factors of each participant. Newborns were evaluated at birth and followed up to 1 year of age to determine congenital infection.
   RESULTS An overall prevalence of 3.2% (95% CI 2.4-4.2) among 1518 pregnant women was detected. Prevalences by provinces were as follows: Guanentina: 6.0% (95% CI 4.1-8.5), Garcia Rovira: 2.9% (95% CI: 1.5-4.8) and Comunera: 0.4% (0.4-2.3). The main risk factors identified were age >32 years old (OR: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.1-3.9); currently having a thatched roof (OR: 11.8; CI95% 2.2-63.2) and a thatched roof during childhood (OR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.4-6.6); having below primary school education level (OR: 4.6; 95% CI: 2.2-9.5); and a history of a close contact with the vector (triatomine bugs) at least once during their lifetime (OR: 6.9; 95% CI: 3.7-12.9). No congenital cases were detected by parasitological or serological techniques.
   CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women is a potential source of infection in this Colombian endemic area. The main risk factors associated with seropositivity were related to conditions favouring the contact with the vector. The results show that it is necessary to continue an active surveillance in order to offer diagnosis and treatment to mothers and their newborns in addition to screening to pregnant women from endemic areas.

AB  - Chagas congenital infection is an important health problem in endemic and non-endemic areas in which Trypanosoma cruzi-infected women can transmit the parasite to their offspring. In this study, we evaluated the antibody levels against the T. cruzi Shed Acute Phase Antigen (SAPA) in 91 binomial samples of seropositive pregnant women and their infected and non-infected children by ELISA. In 70 children without congenital T. cruzi transmission, the titers of anti-SAPA antibodies were lower than those of their seropositive mothers. In contrast, 90.5% of 21 congenitally infected children, at around 1 month of age, showed higher anti-SAPA antibody levels than their mothers. Subtracting the SAPA-ELISA mother OD value to the SAPA-ELISA child OD allowed efficient detection of most T. cruzi congenitally infected children immediately after birth, when total anti-parasite antibodies transferred during pregnancy are still present in all children born to seropositive women. A positive correlation was observed between parasitemia levels in mothers and infants evaluated by quantitative DNA amplification and anti-SAPA antibody titers by ELISA. As SAPA serology has proved to be very efficient to detect T. cruzi infection in mother-child binomial samples, it could be of extreme help for early diagnosis of newborns, in maternities and hospitals where DNA amplification is not available. This prompt diagnosis may prevent drop out of the long-term follow-up for future diagnosis and may ensure early trypanocidal treatment, which has proved to be efficient to cure infants with congenital Chagas disease.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, the causing agent of Chagas disease, can be transmitted to the offspring of infected pregnant women, thus being an epidemiologically important way of parasite transmission in humans. In addition, the migration of infected women from endemic areas to nonendemic countries may export this parasite infection. The diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease relies on the detection of the parasite because maternal antibodies are passively transferred to infants during pregnancy. The diagnosis of congenital infection can also be confirmed by detection of infant-specific anti-T cruzi antibodies at 10 months after delivery. Because early detection of T cruzi infection in newborns allows an efficient trypanocidal treatment and cure, more sensitive molecular techniques such as DNA amplification are being used for a prompt parasitological diagnosis of children born to seropositive mothers. In this report, we describe a diagnosis case of a child congenitally infected with T cruzi who tested negative for parasite detection both by microscopic observation and DNA amplification at 20 days and 6 months after delivery. However, at 7 months of age, a hemoculture was made from the infant's blood, and the infective parasite was finally isolated and classified as T cruzi discrete typing unit I. In a retrospective study, real-time polymerase chain reaction also allowed detecting the parasite but failed to detect any parasite load in earlier control samples. This case report stresses that even when molecular techniques are negative, a long-term follow-up is necessary for the diagnosis of infants congenitally infected with T cruzi.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas disease is caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, being one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the Americas with an estimated six to seven million infected people worldwide. In Brazil, the improvement in vector control and blood donor screening has evidenced the important epidemiological role of congenital transmission of Chagas disease. Methods: A serological survey for Chagas disease was performed in 3,952 newborns in the southern region of Sergipe using paper filter disks of dried blood samples. The newborns were screened using the Sergipe State Neonatal Screening Program between July 2015 and July 2016, and 3,749 and 750 blood samples were obtained for the IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence assay, respectively. In addition, mothers of the children who presented initial reagent serology were examined. Results: Among 3,749 blood samples, samples of two children were positive for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; however, their confirmation test results were negative, suggesting passive transfer of the mother's antibody. One puerpera was identified with Chagas disease, with a prevalence of 0.02%. Conclusions: Congenital Chagas disease was not observed in newborns in the Southern region of Sergipe. However, Chagas disease was observed in women of reproductive age. Therefore, effective measurements for monitoring and systematic evaluation should be conducted. The Neonatal Screening Program proved to be an effective public health strategy for the prevention and control of Chagas disease.

AB  - Background. We evaluated the effectiveness of treating women of childbearing age with benznidazole to prevent congenital Chagas disease (CCD), as well as the usefulness of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a tool to predict the risk of transmission.
   Methods. Prospective study involving 144 T. cruzi seropositive pregnant women. The parasitological status was studied by PCR in 159 pregnancies, 38 of which involved a cohort of previously treated mothers. One hundred sixty children were examined by PCR and serologically studied at 0-6, 9 and 12 months and annually after treatment.
   Results. PCR was seen to be useful for predicting the risk of congenital transmission: 18.8% of mothers with a positive PCR result transmitted the infection (16 infected children out of 85 pregnancies). No infected infants were detected among 74 pregnancies when PCR was negative. Of the treated mothers, 92.1% had negative PCR results, compared with 32.2% of untreated mothers. No infected infants were detected from previously treated mothers, compared with 13.2% among untreated mothers (P = .019;X-2). All infants treated before the first year of life were cured.
   Conclusions. Treating infected women of childbearing age prevents CCD by reducing the parasitemia. PCR is an useful tool in the CCD diagnostic algorithm.

AB  - Background In Mexico, estimates of Chagas disease prevalence and burden vary widely. Updating surveillance data is therefore an important priority to ensure that Chagas disease does not remain a barrier to the development of Mexico's most vulnerable populations.
   Methodology/Principal findings The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the literature on epidemiological surveys to estimate Chagas disease prevalence and burden in Mexico, during the period 2006 to 2017. A total of 2,764 articles were screened and 36 were retained for the final analysis. Epidemiological surveys have been performed in most of Mexico, but with variable study scale and geographic coverage. Based on studies reporting confirmed cases (i.e. using at least 2 serological tests), and taking into account the differences in sample sizes, the national estimated seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection was 3.38% [95%CI 2.59-4.16], suggesting that there are 4.06 million cases in Mexico. Studies focused on pregnant women, which may transmit the parasite to their newborn during pregnancy, reported an estimated seroprevalence of 2.21% [95%CI 1.46-2.96], suggesting that there are 50,675 births from T. cruzi infected pregnant women per year, and 3,193 cases of congenitally infected newborns per year. Children under 18 years had an estimated seropositivity rate of 1.51% [95%CI 0.77-2.25], which indicate ongoing transmission. Cases of T. cruzi infection in blood donors have also been reported in most states, with a national estimated seroprevalence of 0.55% [95%CI 0.43-0.66].
   Conclusions/Significance Our analysis suggests a disease burden for T. cruzi infection higher than previously recognized, highlighting the urgency of establishing Chagas disease surveillance and control as a key national public health priority in Mexico, to ensure that it does not remain a major barrier to the economic and social development of the country's most vulnerable populations.

AB  - Aims: To assess the epigenetic effects of in utero exposure to maternal Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Methods: We performed an epigenome-wide association study to compare the DNA methylation patterns of umbilical cord blood cells from uninfected babies from chagasic and uninfected mothers. DNA methylation was measured using Infinium EPIC arrays. Results: We identified a differential DNA methylation signature of fetal exposure to maternal T. cruzi infection, in the absence of parasite transmission, with 12 differentially methylated sites in B cells and CD4(+) T cells, including eight protein-coding genes. Conclusion: These genes participate in hematopoietic cell differentiation and the immune response and may be involved in immune disorders. They also have been associated with several developmental disorders and syndromes.
   Plain language summary Maternal infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, may influence fetal development, even in the absence of parasite transmission. Thus we investigated how exposure to maternal infection might lead to changes in gene expression in the infant, by examining changes in DNA methylation in the umbilical cord blood. We found that exposure to maternal infection alters DNA methylation of at least 12 sites, including eight genes. Expression of these genes may be altered, which may affect blood cell function, the immune response and newborn development later in life. Further studies should monitor newborns from infected mothers to better assess their health and possible longer term effects.

AB  - Background
   Congenital transmission is a major source of new Trypanosoma cruzi infections, and as vector and blood bank control continue to improve, the proportion due to congenital infection will grow. A major unanswered question is why reported transmission rates from T. cruzi-infected mothers vary so widely among study populations. Women with high parasite loads during pregnancy are more likely to transmit to their infants, but the factors that govern maternal parasite load are largely unknown. Better understanding of these factors could enable prioritization of screening programs to target women most at risk of transmission to their infants.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We screened pregnant women presenting for delivery in a large urban hospital in Bolivia and followed infants of infected women for congenital Chagas disease. Of 596 women screened, 128 (21.5%) had confirmed T. cruzi infection; transmission occurred from 15 (11.7%) infected women to their infants. Parasite loads were significantly higher among women who transmitted compared to those who did not. Congenital transmission occurred from 31.3% (9/29), 15.4% (4/26) and 0% (0/62) of women with high, moderate and low parasite load, respectively (chi x(2) for trend 18.2; p < 0.0001). Twin births were associated with higher transmission risk and higher maternal parasite loads. Infected women without reported vector exposure had significantly higher parasite loads than those who had lived in an infested house (median 26.4 vs 0 parasites/mL; p < 0.001) with an inverse relationship between years of living in an infested house and parasite load.
   Conclusions/Significance
   We hypothesize that sustained vector-borne parasite exposure and repeated superinfection by T. cruzi may act as an immune booster, allowing women to maintain effective control of the parasite despite the down-regulation of late pregnancy.

AB  - Chagas disease afflicts 7 to 8 million people worldwide and congenital Chagas' disease usually leads to changes in the maternal environment, culminating in fetal adaptations. Several articles have described the importance of micronutrients on pregnancy, which is sensitive to infections. In Trypanosoma cruzi endemic regions, the Chagas disease is aggravated by the lack of micronutrients in an average diet, to which pregnant women are more susceptible. The aim of this study was to evaluate distinct T cells phenotypes and intracellular cytokines by flow cytometry in pregnant Wistar rats under zinc therapy during experimental Chagas' disease. Twenty female Wistar rats were infected with 1 x 10(5) blood trypomastigotes (Y strain) and 30 days after infection the animals were mated and grouped: pregnant infected (PI-n = 5), pregnant infected/zinc supplied (PIZ-n = 5), pregnant control (PC-n = 5), control/zinc supplied (PCZ-n = 5). Zinc supplementation: 20 mg of zinc/Kg/day (gavage) for 18 days followed by euthanasia. The immune parameters showed: decreased percentages of CD62(Low)CD44(high) surface marker for infected and treated group (PIZ) when compared to PI (p < 0.05). Concerning to T regulatory cells (Treg cells), a significantly lower percentage of splenic Treg cells was found in the infected and treated group (PIZ) as compared to the PI group (p < 0.05). The expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 displayed a significant reduced percentage in TCD8(+) for infected and zinc treated group (PIZ) as compared to (PI). The percentages of CD4(+)/CD11a(+) T cells subsets were lower on PIZ as compared to PI. Concerning to CD45RA(+) (B lymphocytes) analysis, infected pregnant and treated group (PIZ) showed a significant decrease in CD45RA percentage when compared to (PI) (p < 0.05). The intracellular cytokine profiles for TCD4(+) and TCD8(+) producing IL-4 and IFN-gamma revealed that zinc treated and untreated infected pregnant group (PI and PIZ) displayed increased cytokines concentrations as compared to zinc treated and untreated pregnant controls (PC and PCZ). Our data revealed the involvement of zinc as a signaling molecule in the modulation of the inflammatory process and immune response which occurs during pregnancy of T. cruzi infected rats. Zinc acted in a dual fashion, modulating the host's immune response in a way to protect the organism against the deleterious effects of the infection and an overwhelming pro -inflammatory response during pregnancy.

AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi in pregnant women in endemic areas of Boyaca, Colombia, in 2012 and 2013.
   Materials and methods: Cross-sectional study of 566 pregnant women from endemic municipalities of Boyaca. Samples were analyzed by means of serological tests for Chagas, namely: IgG ELISA, indirect immunofluorescence and indirect hemagglutination. Cases with positive results in two tests were considered as confirmed.
   Results: The overall prevalence of antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi was 2.5 % (14/566). Municipalities with the highest prevalence were Chitaraque (8.3 %), and Soata (3.3 %). Average age of positive women was 32.6 years, and their gestational period, 18.1 weeks. We found a statistically significant association between age and the presence of antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi.
   Conclusion: Prevalence of antibodies against T. cruzi in pregnant women demonstrates the importance of the monitoring program for Chagas disease in pregnancy, as a method for congenital disease control.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi infection in women of reproductive age is associated with congenital transmission and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The placenta is a key barrier to infection. Gene expression profiles of term placental environment from T. cruzi-seropositive (SP) and -seronegative (SN) mothers were characterized by RNA-Seq. Nine pools of placental RNA paired samples were used: three from SN and six from SP tissues. Each pool consisted of female/male newborns and vaginal/cesarean delivery binomials. No newborn was congenitally infected. T. cruzi satellite DNA quantitative PCR in placental tissues and maternal and neonatal blood, and parasite 18S quantitative RT-PCR from placental RNA were negative, except in three SP women's bloodstream. To identify pathways associated with maternal T. cruzi infection, a gene-set association analysis was implemented: SP placental samples showed over-expression of inflammatory response and lymphocytic activation, whereas numerous biosynthetic processes were down-regulated. About 42 genes showed a significant fold-change between SP and SN groups. KISS1 and CGB5 were down-regulated, whereas KIF12, HLA-G, PRG2, TAC3, FN1, and ATXN3L were up-regulated. Several expressed genes in SP placentas encode proteins associated with preeclampsia and miscarriage. This first transcriptomics study in human term placental environment shows a placental response that may affect the fetus while protecting it from parasite infection; this host response could be responsible for the low rate of congenital transmission in chronic Chagas disease.

AB  - Introduction: In non-endemic countries, one of the most important routes of transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi is vertical transmission. The objective of this work is to report the results of the screening activities for the control of congenital Chagas Disease (CD) implemented in Bergamo province between January 2014 and December 2016.
   Methods: The programme addressed Bolivian pregnant women settled in Bergamo province. All the eight hospitals offering antenatal and delivery care in that area were involved. We retrospectively calculated the coverage rate of the screening programme, the prevalence of CD in this population, as well as transmission rate to their offspring.
   Results: During the study period, 376 Bolivian women accounted for 387 deliveries. The coverage rate of serologic screening was 85.6%. Confirmed seropositive women were 28, accounting for a prevalence of CD of 8.7% (95% IC 5.9-11.5). Among 29 children born to positive mothers, one infected child was detected (transmission rate of 4.3%, 95% IC 0-12.6) and treated accordingly. Other 13 children previously born from the same mothers were retrieved and tested for CD: no additional congenital cases were diagnosed.
   Discussion Our screening programme presented a high coverage, although widely variable in the different birthing facilities. National guidelines recommending CD testing in pregnant women would help to increase case detection countrywide.

AB  - Background. We studied women and their infants to evaluate risk factors for congenital transmission and cardiomyopathy in Trypanosoma cruzi-infected women.
   Methods. Women provided data and blood for serology and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Infants of infected women had blood tested at 0 and 1 month by microscopy, PCR and immunoblot, and serology at 6 and 9 months. Women underwent electrocardiography (ECG).
   Results. Of 1696 women, 456 (26.9%) were infected; 31 (6.8%) transmitted T. cruzi to their infants. Women who transmitted had higher parasite loads than those who did not (median, 62.0 [interquartile range {IQR}, 25.8-204.8] vs 0.05 [IQR, 0-29.6]; P < .0001). Transmission was higher in twin than in singleton births (27.3% vs 6.4%; P = .04). Women who had not lived in infested houses transmitted more frequently (9.7% vs 4.6%; P = .04), were more likely to have positive results by PCR (65.5% vs 33.9%; P < .001), and had higher parasite loads than those who had lived in infested houses (median, 25.8 [IQR, 0-64.1] vs 0 [IQR, 0-12.3]; P < .001). Of 302 infected women, 28 (9.3%) had ECG abnormalities consistent with Chagas cardiomyopathy; risk was higher for older women (odds ratio [OR], 1.06 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.01-1.12] per year) and those with vector exposure (OR, 3.7 [95% CI, 1.4-10.2]). We observed a strong dose-response relationship between ECG abnormalities and reported years of living in an infested house.
   Conclusions. We hypothesize that repeated vector-borne infection sustains antigen exposure and the consequent inflammatory response at a higher chronic level, increasing cardiac morbidity, but possibly enabling exposed women to control parasitemia in the face of pregnancy-induced Th2 polarization.

AB  - American trypanosomiasis has long been a neglected disease endemic in LatinAmerica, but congenital transmission has now spread Chagas disease to cause a global health problem. As the early stages of the infection of placental tissue and the vertical transmission by Trypanosoma cruzi are still not well understood, it is important to investigate the relevance of the first structure of the placental barrier in chorionic villi infection by T. cruzi during the initial stage of the infection. Explants of human chorionic villi from healthy pregnant women at term were denuded of their syncytiotrophoblast and co-cultured for 3 h, 24 h and 96 h with 800,000 trypomastigotes (simulating acute infection). T. cruzi infected cells were identified by immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin-7 (+cytotrophoblast) and CD68 (+macrophages), and the infection was quantified. In placental tissue, the parasite load was analyzed by qPCR and microscopy, and the motile trypomastigotes were quantified in culture supernatant. In denuded chorionic villous, the total area occupied by the parasite (451.23 mu m(2),1.33%) and parasite load (RQ: 87) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in the entire villous (control) (5.98 mu m(2), 0.016%) (RQ:1) and with smaller concentration of nitric oxide. Stromal non-macrophage cells were infected as well as cytotrophoblasts and some macrophages, but with significant differences being observed. The parasite quantity in the culture supernatant was significantly higher (p <0.05) in denuded culture explants from 96 h of culture. Although the human complete chorionic villi limited the infection, the detachment of the first structure of the placenta barrier (syncytiotrophoblast) increased both the infection of the villous stroma and the living trypomastigotes in the culture supernatant. Therefore structural and functional alterations to chorionic villi placental barrier reduce placental defenses and may contribute to the vertical transmission of Chagas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi infection leads to Chagas disease (CD), a neglected tropical infection of significant public health importance in South and Central America and other, non-endemic, countries. Pregnant women and their children are of particular importance to screen as T. cruzi can be transmitted vertically. The objective of this study was to screen for T. cruzi infection among pregnant women from endemic areas seen at the Hospital General de Mexico for prenatal care, so that they and their children may be quickly connected to CD treatment. Pregnant women were recruited through the hospital prenatal clinic and screened for T. cruzi infection using a series of serological and molecular tests. Of 150 screened patients, mean age 26.8 (SD 6.4), 30 (20.0%) were positive by at least one diagnostic test. Of these, only nine (6%) were positive as determined by PCR. Diagnosis of chronic CD is difficult in endemic places like Mexico due to the limitations of current commercially available diagnostic tests. Further evaluation of diagnostic performance of various assays could improve current CD diagnostic algorithms and proper care management in these regions. Genetic variability in the parasite may also play a role in the differing assay performances seen in this study, and this may be a valuable avenue of further research.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease is a globally important chronic systemic parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Aim: To determine the prevalence of antibodies against T. cruzi in pregnant women front the state of Morelos, Mexico. Methods: 1,620 sera from pregnant women were analyzed using two serological tests: ELISAc (native crude antigen) and ELISAr (recombinant, non-native antigen). Reactive samples were subsequently analyzed by indirect hemagglutination (IHA). Two detection approaches were used, in parallel (reactive samples by any method are positive) and serial (samples confirmed by IHA are positive). Sociodemographic and health factors associated with the presence of antibodies against T. cruzi were evaluated using 95% odds ratios. Results: A seroprevalence of 4.87% was obtained with parallel diagnosis and 0.43% in series. From the parallel results, the women who were attended at the general hospitals of Tetecala and Jojutla had respectively 2.2 and 2.0 times greater chance of presenting antibodies against T. cruzi compared to the women who were attended at the General Hospital of Cuautla. Conclusion: The prevalence of antibodies against T. cruzi in pregnant women from the state of Morelos fluctuated between 0.43 and 4.87%, depending on the antigen and the approach used. It is necessary to continue with the surveillance of the seroprevalence of antibodies against T. cruzi in pregnant women from the state of Morelos, Mexico, using the techniques with the highest sensitivity and specificity available.

AB  - Objective To estimate the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women and the vertical transmission of the disease.
   Methods Observational studies were identified from eight electronic databases, and details on study design, population and prevalence of Chagas disease were extracted. The data were pooled using a random-effects model, and choropleth maps were created based on geopolitical regions and countries.
   Results The search identified 7788 articles, of which 50 were eligible. We observed a 9% prevalence of Chagas disease among pregnant women in the Americas (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8-10, I-2 = 99.96%). High disease prevalence was identified in pregnant women in South American countries (12%, 95% CI: 11-13), while lower values were identified in pregnant women in North America (2%, 95% CI: 1-3). Countries with medium Human Development Index (HDI) had a higher prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women (15%, 95% CI: 13-16, I-2 = 99.98%) than countries with high HDI (3%, 95% CI: 2-3). The rate of vertical transmission in the continent was 2% (95% CI: 1-2). The statistical analysis showed that this heterogeneity was explained by the study design, region of the Americas and mean income of the country.
   Conclusion South and Central American countries have a high prevalence and vertical transmission of Chagas disease. Therefore, systematic screens for this disease during the prenatal period are necessary in addition to the diagnosis and treatment of children at risk for Trypanosoma cruzi infection.

AB  - Trypanos o ma cruzi (T cruzi or Tc) is the causative agent of Chagas disease (CD). It is common for patients to suffer from non-specific symptoms or be clinically asymptomatic with acute and chronic conditions acquired through various routes of transmission. The expecting women and their fetuses are vulnerable to congenital transmission of Tc. Pregnant women face formidable health challenges because the frontline antiparasitic drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox, are contraindicated during pregnancy. However, it is worthwhile to highlight that newborns can be cured if they are diagnosed and given treatment in a timely manner. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis of maternal-fetal transmission of Tc and provide a justification for the investment in the development of vaccines against congenital CD.

AB  - Purpose The state of Veracruz, Mexico, is a well-recognized endemic region for Chagas disease, but congenital transmission has not been extensively studied. We estimated here the prevalence and the risk of congenital transmission ofTrypanosoma cruziin pregnant women from 27 municipalities of central Veracruz. Methods 528 sera from pregnant women were analyzed by ELISA and IFA assays for the detection of IgG antibodies againstT. cruzi. Results The presence of anti-T. cruziantibodies was identified in women from 17 municipalities, obtaining an overall seroprevalence of 17.0%. A higher seropositivity was observed in the municipalities of Orizaba (25.2%), Nogales (13.6%), and Rio Blanco (10.5%). The results suggest that there is a high risk of congenital transmission ofT. cruziin the region. Conclusion There are currently limited actions for the surveillance and control of congenital transmission of Chagas disease in Veracruz.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease, as a consequence of globalization and immigration, is no more restricted to Central and Latin America. Therefore, congenital transmission represents a growing public health concern in non-endemic countries.
   Methods: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in pregnant Latin American (LA) women living outside endemic countries and the rate of congenital transmission. Data were extracted from studies indexed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Lilacs and SciELO databases without language restriction. Two investigators independently collected data on study characteristics, diagnosis, prevalence of infection in pregnant women and congenital infection rate. The data were pooled using a random effects model.
   Results: The search identified 1078 articles of which 29 were eligible regarding prevalence of T. cruzi infection among pregnant women and 1795 articles of which 32 were eligible regarding the congenital transmission rate. The estimated pooled prevalence of T. cruzi infection in LA pregnant women was 4.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.0-5.5]. The prevalence of T. cruzi infection in pregnant women from Bolivia was 15.5% (95% CI: 11.7-19.7) and 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-0.89) for those coming from all other LA countries. The estimated global rate of congenital transmission was 3.5% (95% CI: 2.5-4.5); excluding poor-quality studies, the rate of congenital transmission was 3.8% (95% CI: 2.4-5.1).
   Conclusions: Prevalence of Chagas disease among LA pregnant women living outside endemic countries is high, particularly in Bolivian women. The rate of vertical transmission of T. cruzi infection is similar to the rate reported in South and Central American countries.

AB  - The newborns of women infected with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (the agent of Chagas disease) can be infected either before birth (congenitally), or after birth (as e.g., by vector route). Congenital Chagas disease can induce high levels of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Parasite-infected pregnant women transmit antibodies to their fetus. Antibodies, by opsonizing parasites, can promote phagocytosis and killing of T. cruzi by cells expressing Fc gamma R, on the mandatory condition that such cells are sufficiently activated in an inflammatory context. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a mechanism well described in viral infections, by which antibodies enhance entry of infectious agents into host cells by exploiting the phagocytic Fc gamma R pathway. Previously reported Chagas disease studies highlighted a severe reduction of the maternal-fetal/neonatal inflammatory context in parasite-transmitting pregnant women and their congenitally infected newborns. Otherwise, experimental observations brought to light ADE of T. cruzi infection (involving Fc gamma R) in mouse pups displaying maternally transferred antibodies, out of an inflammatory context. Herein, based on such data, we discuss the previously unconsidered possibility of a role of ADE in the trans-placental parasite transmission, and/or the development of severe and mortal clinical forms of congenital/neonatal Chagas disease in newborns of T. cruzi-infected mothers.</p>

AB  - Chagas disease is caused by an infection with the protozoan hemoflagellate Trypanosoma cruzi, and it is a major endemic health problem in Latin America. The congenital route is one of the main non-vectorial pathways of transmission, which can arise either in the chronic or acute phase of maternal infection. Serological screening of T. cruzi infection was performed in 520 pregnant women and newborns at the Hospital General Regional de Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico, between 2014 and 2015. Anti-T. cruzi antibodies were detected in 20 mothers (4%) by ELISA and HIA with four PCR-positive newborn cases. Risk factors were identified according to an epidemiological survey, and the most significant (P <0.050) factors associated with T. cruzi infection were the building materials of dwellings, the presence of pets and dwellings located in rural areas. This study constitutes the first systematic study on congenital Chagas disease and the epidemiological risk factors in Guanajuato. Our results represent the probability of an incidence of 770 cases per 100,000 births during a period of 12 months, with a vertical transmission rate by 0.8%, which highlights the necessity to establish reliable serological and PCR tests in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission. However, it is also important to follow-up the newborns from seropositive mothers for one year, which is necessary, as many children yielded negative results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease that continues to affect populations living in extreme poverty in Latin America. After successful vector control programs, congenital transmission remains as a challenge to disease elimination. We used the PRECEDE-PROCEED planning model to develop strategies for neonatal screening of congenital Chagas disease in rural communities of Guatemala. These communities have persistent high triatomine infestations and low access to healthcare. We used mixed methods with multiple stakeholders to identify and address maternal-infant health behaviors through semi-structured interviews, participatory group meetings, archival reviews and a cross-sectional survey in high risk communities. From December 2015 to April 2016, we jointly developed a strategy to illustratively advertise newborn screening at the Health Center. The strategy included socioculturally appropriate promotional and educational material, in collaboration with midwives, nurses and nongovernmental organizations. By March 2016, eight of 228 (3.9%) pregnant women had been diagnosed with T. cruzi at the Health Center. Up to this date, no neonatal screening had been performed. By August 2016, seven of eight newborns born to Chagas seropositive women had been parasitologically screened at the Health Center, according to international standards. Thus, we implemented a successful community-based neonatal screening strategy to promote congenital Chagas disease healthcare in a rural setting. The success of the health promotion strategies developed will depend on local access to maternal-infant services, integration with detection of other congenital diseases and reliance on community participation in problem and solution definition.

AB  - Objectives Chagas disease (CD) is caused by infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that nests in various tissues, causing irreversible cardiac damage in 30% of patients with chronic disease and neurological or digestive lesions in 10%. CD is now found in areas receiving migrant populations where no vector-borne transmission occurs. Chagasic cardiomyopathy (CC) is the most serious complication of the chronic phase of CD and the major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with CD.
   Case presentation Bolivian woman at 38 weeks of gestation was admitted at the emergency room with the diagnosis of congestive heart failure. Cesarean section was performed and maternal hypotension and uterine atony occurred. Dilated myocardiopathy with severe left ventricle dysfunction was diagnosed. The patient referred positive serology for T. cruzi and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive so benznidazole therapy was started. She was discharged due to progressive improvement with cardiological treatment and implantable cardioverter defibrillator was placed 5 years later for the prevention of sudden cardiac death.
   Conclusions The diagnosis of CC in non-endemic areas requires a high index of suspicion and it is based on serology. Antiparasitic drugs are almost 100% effective in infected newborn babies and highly effective in the treatment of patients in the acute stage of the disease. However, the efficacy of both drugs decreases the longer a person has been infected. Treatment of CC that causes chronic heart failure is similar to that in non-Chagasic etiology.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease continues to be a serious public health problem, and accounts for 25-30% of the indications for cardiac stimulation in Brazil.
   Objective: To assess clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients with Chagas disease, younger than 18 years, who had undergone pacemaker implantation in Brazil between 1994 and 2011, and its temporal trend.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Brazilian Pacemaker Registry database. The following variables were analyzed: year when pacemaker was implanted, location, age, sex, ethnic group, functional class and the main electrocardiographic findings at baseline.
   Results: In a total of 183,123 implants performed between 1994 and 2011, 214 implants of cardiac stimulation device in Chagas disease patients aged younger than 18 years were identified. Mean age at implantation was 5.6 +/- 6.2 years. Second-and third-degree atrioventricular blocks corresponded to 71% of indications for pacemaker implantation. Fifty-six percent of the procedures were performed in the southeast region. Regarding the total number of pacemaker implants per year, there was a remarkable increase in the implants for all causes. However, time series analysis of the implants in Chagas disease patients younger than 18 years revealed a significant reduction in the annual number of implants.
   Conclusion: There has been an important reduction in the number of pacemaker implantations among children and adolescents with Chagas disease, suggesting a reduction in the vertical transmission of the parasite.

AB  - Chagas disease is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and about 230,000 persons are estimated to be infected in Ecuador. However, limited studies have been performed in the Amazon region, on the eastern side of the country. We evaluated here the seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in 12 rural villages of the Loreto canton, Orellana Province in schoolchildren aged 5-15 years and in pregnant women. A total of 1,649 blood samples were tested for Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect hemaglutination, and discordant samples were tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay. We detected a seroprevalence of anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies of 1.3% in schoolchildren aged 5-15 years, indicating the persistence of a constant and active vectorial transmission in the Loreto County and confirming the need of the implementation of nonconventional vector control. We also observed a seroprevalence of 3.8% in pregnant women, indicating a clear risk of congenital transmission. Further studies should help define this risk more precisely and implement current international guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and care of these cases.

AB  - In recent decades and because of migration, Chagas disease has become a global public health problem. A significant focus has been placed on pregnant women who can transmit the disease to their offspring. Here, we report four cases of women who did not know that they were pregnant while they were being treated with benznidazole. A diagnosis was established according to serology and Trypanosoma cruzi polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-standardized tests. Treatment was discontinued when pregnancy was confirmed, and a thorough follow-up was carried out. Although each case was different, none of the mothers developed health problems during pregnancy, and their newborns were delivered without any teratogenic effects.

AB  - Background. Diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease (CChD) in most endemic areas is based on low-sensitive microscopy at birth and 9-month immunoglobulin G (IgG), which has poor adherence. We aim to evaluate the accuracy of the Immunoglobulin M (IgM)-Shed Acute Phase Antigen (SAPA) test in the diagnosis of CChD at birth.
   Methods. Two cohort studies (training and validation cohorts) were conducted in 3 hospitals in the department of Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Pregnant women were screened for Chagas disease, and all infants born to seropositive mothers were followed for up to 9 months to diagnose CChD. A composite reference standard was used to determine congenital infection and was based on the parallel use of microscopy, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and IgM-trypomastigote excreted-secreted antigen (TESA) blot at birth and/or 1 month, and/or the detection of anti-Trypanosoma cruzi IgG at 6 or 9 months. The diagnostic accuracy of the IgM-SAPA test was calculated at birth against the composite reference standard.
   Results. Adherence to the 6- or 9-month follow-up ranged from 25.3% to 59.7%. Most cases of CChD (training and validation cohort: 76.5% and 83.7%, respectively) were detected during the first month of life using the combination of microscopy, qPCR, and/or IgM-TESA blot. Results from the validation cohort showed that when only 1 infant sample obtained at birth was evaluated, the qPCR and the IgM-SAPA test have similar accuracy (sensitivity: range, 79.1%-97.1% and 76.7%-94.3%, respectively, and specificity: 99.5% and 92.6%, respectively).
   Conclusions. The IgM-SAPA test has the potential to be implemented as an early diagnostic tool in areas that currently rely only on microscopy.

AB  - Background
   Chagas disease (CD) is a chronic parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and is endemic to continental Latin America. In Spain, the main transmission route is congenital. We aimed to assess adherence to regional recommendations of universal screening for CD during pregnancy in Latin American women in the province of Alicante from 2014 to 2018.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Retrospective quality study using two availa sources: 1) delivery records of Latin American women that gave birth in the 10 public hospitals of Alicante between January 2014 and December 2018; and 2) records of Chagas serologies carried out in those centers between May 2013 and December 2018. There were 3026 deliveries in Latin American women during the study period; 1178 (38.9%) underwent CD serology. Screening adherence ranged from 17.2% to 59.3% in the different health departments and was higher in Bolivian women (48.3%). Twenty-six deliveries (2.2%) had a positive screening; CD was confirmed in 23 (2%) deliveries of 21 women. Bolivians had the highest seroprevalence (21/112; 18.7%), followed by Colombians (1/333; 0.3%) and Ecuadorians (1/348; 0.3%). Of 21 CD-positive women (19 Bolivians, 1 Colombian, 1 Ecuadorian), infection was already known in 12 (57.1%), and 9 (42.9%) had already been treated. Only 1 of the 12 untreated women (8.3%) was treated postpartum. Follow-up started in 20 of the 23 (87.0%) neonates but was completed only in 11 (47.8%); no cases of congenital transmission were detected. Among the 1848 unscreened deliveries, we estimate 43 undiagnosed cases of CD and 1 to 2 undetected cases of congenital transmission.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Adherence to recommendations of systematic screening for CD in Latin American pregnant women in Alicante can be improved. Strategies to strengthen treatment of postpartum women and monitoring of exposed newborns are needed. Currently, there may be undetected cases of congenital transmission in our province.
   Author summary
   Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease endemic to Latin America. In absence of the triatomine vector in Spain, congenital (mother-to-infant) transmission is the main infection route. The Valencian Community has recommended universal screening for CD in pregnant Latin American women since 2007. In our study we analyzed adherence to that recommendation in Alicante province from 2014 to 2018, finding that it is quite low (38.9% overall, 48.3% in Bolivians) and heterogeneous between health departments. Among unscreened pregnant women during the study period, we estimate that there could be 43 undiagnosed cases of CD and 1 to 2 undetected infections in infants. We also observed very low adherence to treatment after delivery in CD-diagnosed, untreated women (8.3%), and a low rate of completed follow-up in newborns at risk of vertical infection (47.8%). We need to improve the program in order to achieve universal CD screening in Latin American (and especially Bolivian) pregnant women, to enhance CD treatment in postpartum women, and to improve monitoring in exposed newborns through a well-established notification and follow-up circuit.

AB  - Purpose of Review Why around 5% ofTrypanosoma cruzi-infected pregnant women transmit the parasite to their offspring whereas 95% do not? Answers to this main question are needed in order to improve the programs aiming to control or eliminate congenital Chagas disease (CCD), which has become an important global public health problem. Recent Findings Turnover of syncitiotrophoblast as a new innate defense mechanism of placenta and analyses of transcriptomic responses of placental genes and of new parasite DNA sequences have allowed a re-evaluation of the relationship between parasite diversity, placental tropism, and CCD transmission. A synthetic view of the gradual interactions between the human placenta facing up the parasites present in the maternal blood and the occurrence and severity of CCD is proposed. Further researches on the role of parasite molecular diversity, maternal microbiomes, transfers of parasite and placenta exovesicles, and genetic features of infected mothers should improve our understanding of such maternal-fetal complex relationship.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is the protozoan unicellular parasite that causes Chagas disease. It can be transmitted from infected mothers to their babies via the connatal route, thus being able to perpetuate even in the absence of Triatomine insect vectors. Chagas disease was originally endemic in Central and South America, but migration of infected women of childbearing age has spread the T. cruzi congenital infection to non-endemic areas like North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia. Currently, 7 million people are affected by this infection worldwide. This review focuses on the relevance of the T. cruzi parasite levels in different aspects of the congenital T. cruzi infection such as the mother-to-child transmission rate, the maternal and fetal immune response, and its impact on the diagnosis of infected newborns. Improvements in detection of this parasite, with tools that can be easily adapted to be used in remote rural areas, will make the early diagnosis of infected children possible, allowing a prompt trypanocidal treatment and avoiding the current loss of opportunities for the diagnosis of 100% of T. cruzi congenitally infected infants.

AB  - Background: Currently, there are no solutions to prevent congenital transmission of Chagas disease during pregnancy, which affects 1-40% of pregnant women in Latin America and is associated with a 5% transmission risk. With therapeutic vaccines under development, now is the right time to determine the economic value of such a vaccine to prevent congenital transmission.
   Methods: We developed a computational decision model that represented the clinical outcomes and diagnostic testing strategies for an infant born to a Chagas-positive woman in Mexico and evaluated the impact of vaccination.
   Results: Compared to no vaccination, a 25% efficacious vaccine averted 125 [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 122-128] congenital cases, 1.9 (95% UI: 1.6-2.2) infant deaths, and 78 (95% UI: 66-91) DALYs per 10,000 infected pregnant women; a 50% efficacious vaccine averted 251 (95% UI: 248-254) cases, 3.8 (95% UI: 3.6-4.2) deaths, and 160 (95% UI: 148-171) DALYs; and a 75% efficacious vaccine averted 376 (95% UI: 374-378) cases, 5.8 (95% UI: 5.5-6.1) deaths, and 238 (95% UI: 227-249) DALYs. A 25% efficacious vaccine was cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <3x Mexico's gross domestic product per capita, <$29,698/DALY averted) when the vaccine cost <=$240 and <=$310 and cost-saving when <=$10 and <=$80 from the third-party payer and societal perspectives, respectively. A 50% efficacious vaccine was cost-effective when costing <=$490 and <=$615 and cost-saving when <=$25 and <=$160, from the third-party payer and societal perspectives, respectively. A 75% efficacious vaccine was cost-effective when <=$720 and <=$930 and cost-saving when <=$40 and <=$250 from the third-party payer and societal perspectives, respectively. Additionally, 13-42 fewer infants progressed to chronic disease, saving $0.41-$1.21 million to society.
   Conclusion: We delineated the thresholds at which therapeutic vaccination of Chagas-positive pregnant women would be cost-effective and cost-saving, providing economic guidance for decision-makers to consider when developing and bringing such a vaccine to market.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, exhibits a high genetic variability and has been classified into six discrete typing units (DTUs) named TcI through TcVI. This genetic diversity is believed to be associated with clinical characteristics and outcomes, but evidence supporting such associations has been limited. Herein, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of T. cruzi sequences of the mini-exon intergenic region obtained from a Large cohort of pregnant women and newborns from Argentina, Honduras, and Mexico, to assess parasite genetic diversity and possible associations with congenital transmission. Analysis of 105 samples (including five paired samples) from maternal and umbilical cord blood indicated that T. cruzi DTU distribution was similar among pregnant women and newborns from these three countries, with a high frequency of TcII-TcV-TcVI DTUs, including mixed infections with TcI. However, phylogenetic analysis revealed that although the same parasite haplotypes circulated in these three countries, they were present at different frequencies, leading to significant geographic differences. Of importance, a strong association was observed between parasite haplotypes and congenital infection of newborns. Thus, the identification of parasite haplotypes in pregnant women, but not of parasite DTUs, may help predict congenital transmission of T. cruzi.

AB  - Background. Vertical transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi infection accounts for a growing proportion of new cases of Chagas disease. Better risk stratification is needed to predict which women are more likely to transmit the infection.
   Methods. This study enrolled women and their infants at the Percy Boland Women's Hospital in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. Pregnant women were screened for Chagas disease by rapid test and received confirmatory serology. Infants of seropositive mothers underwent diagnostic testing with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
   Results. Among 5828 enrolled women, 1271 (21.8%) screened positive for Chagas disease. Older maternal age, family history of Chagas disease, home conditions, lower educational level, and history of living in a rural area were significantly associated with higher adjusted odds of maternal infection. Of the 1325 infants of seropositive mothers, 65 infants (4.9%) were diagnosed with congenital Chagas disease. Protective factors against transmission included cesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:.60; 95% confidence interval [CI]:.36-.99) and family history of Chagas disease (aOR:.58; 95% CI:.34-.99). Twins were significantly more likely to be congenitally infected than singleton births (OR: 3.32; 95% CI: 1.60-6.90). Among congenitally infected infants, 32.3% had low birth weight, and 30.8% required hospitalization after birth.
   Conclusions. Although improved access to screening and qPCR increased the number of infants diagnosed with congenital Chagas disease, many infants remain undiagnosed. A better understanding of risk factors and improved access to highly sensitive and specific diagnostic techniques for congenital Chagas disease may help improve regional initiatives to reduce disease burden.

AB  - We describe the eleventh major outbreak of foodborne Trypanosoma cruzi transmission in urban Venezuela, including evidence for vertical transmission from the index case to her fetus. After confirming fetal death at 24 weeks of gestation, pregnancy interruption was performed. On direct examination of the amniotic fluid, trypomastigotes were detected. T. cruzi specific-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) also proved positive when examining autopsied fetal organs. Finally, microscopic fetal heart examination revealed amastigote nests. Acute orally transmitted Chagas disease can be life threatening or even fatal for pregnant women and unborn fetuses owing to vertical transmission. There is therefore an urgent need to improve national epidemiologic control measures.

AB  - Congenital infection with Trypanosoma cruzi is a global problem, occurring on average in 5% of children born from chronically infected mothers in endemic areas, with variations depending on the region. This presentation aims to focus on and update epidemiological data, research methods, involved factors, control strategy and possible prevention of congenital infection with T. cruzi. Considering that etiological treatment of the child is always effective if performed before one year of age, the diagnosis of infection in pregnant women and their newborns has to become the standard of care and integrated into the surveillance programs of syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus. In addition to the standard tests, polymerase chain reaction performed on blood of neonates of infected mothers one month after birth might improve the diagnosis of congenital infection. Recent data bring out that its transmission can be prevented through treatment of infected women before they become pregnant. The role of parasite genotypes and host genetic factors in parasite transmission and development of infection in foetuses/neonates has to be more investigated in order to better estimate the risk factors and impact on health of congenital infection with T. cruzi.

AB  - This review aims to update and discuss the main challenges in controlling emergent and reemergent forms of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission through organ transplantation, blood products and vertical transmission in endemic and non-endemic areas as well as emergent forms of transmission in endemic countries through contaminated food, currently representing the major cause of acute illness in several countries. As a neglected tropical disease potentially controllable with a major impact on morbimortality and socioeconomic aspects, Chagas disease (CD) was approved at the WHO global plan to interrupt four transmission routes by 2030 (vector/ blood transfusion/organ transplant/congenital). Implementation of universal or target screening for CD are highly recommended in blood banks of non-endemic regions; in organ transplants donors in endemic/non-endemic areas as well as in women at risk from endemic areas (reproductive age women/ pregnant women- respective babies). Moreover, main challenges for surveillance are the application of molecular methods for identification of infected babies, donor transmitted infection and of live parasites in the food. In addition, the systematic recording of acute/non-acute cases and transmission sources is crucial to establish databases for control and surveillance purposes. Remarkably, antiparasitic treatment of infected reproductive age women and infected babies is essential for the elimination of congenital CD by 2030.

Eighteen pediatric infectious disease specialists from Andalusian referral hospitals (fourteen public and four private) participated.
   Results. The Chagas screening during pregnancy was known by seventeen specialists (94%), and systematically applied in seven hospitals (38.9%) by gynecologists or midwives. The protocol for following-up newborns at risk was known by sixteen specialists (88.9%) and applied in ten hospitals (55.5%), two of which did not study siblings and relatives of these newborns. Only two cases of vertical transmission of Chagas (11.1%) were detected; it happened in two hospitals applying systematically the Chagas screening to pregnant woman at risk, the same ones that also diagnosed two cases in siblings of newborns at risk.
   Conclusion. In Andalusia screening of Chagas disease in pregnant women and newborns at risk is not carried out in a systematic and uniform way in all the reference hospitals, so an underdiagnosis of congenital Chagas disease is highly probable. The training of professionals involved in assisting pregnant women and their offspring, and the unification of the follow-up criteria for newborns at risk would be essential for carrying out both a correct diagnosis and an early treatment of these cases.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to discuss the main ecological interactions between the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and its hosts, the mother and the fetus, leading to the transmission and development of congenital Chagas disease. One or several infecting strains of T. cruzi (with specific features) interact with: (i) the immune system of a pregnant woman whom responses depend on genetic and environmental factors, (ii) the placenta harboring its own defenses, and, finally, (iii) the fetal immune system displaying responses also susceptible to be modulated by maternal and environmental factors, as well as his own genetic background which is different from her mother. The severity of congenital Chagas disease depends on the magnitude of such final responses. The paper is mainly based on human data, but integrates also complementary observations obtained in experimental infections. It also focuses on important gaps in our knowledge of this congenital infection, such as the role of parasite diversity vs host genetic factors, as well as that of the maternal and placental microbiomes and the microbiome acquisition by infant in the control of infection. Investigations on these topics are needed in order to improve the programs aiming to diagnose, manage and control congenital Chagas disease. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Serology is the preferred method to confirm a Chagas disease diagnosis and to screen blood donors. A battery of assays is often required due to the limited accuracy of single assays. The Elecsys Chagas assay is a newly developed, double-antigen sandwich assay for use on the Elecsys and cobas e immunoassay analyzers, intended to identify individuals infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, for diagnosis and screening. The performance of the Elecsys Chagas assay was evaluated in comparison with those of other widely used T. cruzi antibody assays, at multiple sites (Europe/Latin America). Relative sensitivity and specificity were assessed by using samples from blood donors, pregnant women, and hospitalized patients from regions where Chagas disease is endemic and from regions of nonendemicity. The Elecsys Chagas assay had an overall relative sensitivity of 100% (n = 674). Overall relative specificities were 99.90% (n = 14,681), 100% (n = 313), and 100% (n = 517) for samples from blood donors, pregnant women, and hospitalized patients, respectively. The analytical specificity was 99.83% (n = 594). The Elecsys Chagas assay detected T. cruzi antibodies in two World Health Organization (WHO) standard T. cruzi reference panels (panels 09/188 and 09/186) at a 1: 512 dilution, corresponding to a cutoff sensitivity of approximately 1 mIU/ml. The Elecsys Chagas assay demonstrated robust performance under routine conditions at multiple sites in Europe and Latin America. In contrast to other available Chagas assays, the Elecsys assay uses a reduced number of recombinant T. cruzi antigens, resulting in a significantly smaller number of cross-reactions and improved analytical specificity while being highly sensitive.

AB  - The primary objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of this disease in women of childbearing age and children treated at health centres in underserviced areas of the city of Buenos Aires. Demographic and Chagas disease status data were collected. Samples for Chagas disease serology were obtained on filter paper and the reactive results were confirmed with conventional samples. A total of 1,786 subjects were screened and 73 positive screening results were obtained: 17 were from children and 56 were from women. The Trypanosoma cruzi infection risk was greater in those individuals who had relatives with Chagas disease, who remember seeing kissing bugs, who were of Bolivian nationality or were born in the Argentine province of Santiago del Estero. The overall prevalence of Chagas disease was 4.08%. Due to migration, Chagas disease is currently predominantly urban. The observed prevalence requires health programme activities that are aimed at urban children and their mothers. Most children were infected congenitally, which reinforces the need for Chagas disease screening of all pregnant women and their babies in Argentina. The active search for new cases is important because the appropriate treatment in children has a high cure rate.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), is endemic in Latin-America and is emerging in Spain due to immigration. The vertical transmission rate is around 5%. A routine prenatal screening with serology of all pregnant women from endemic areas is recommended to identify infected newborns, allowing early treatment and cure.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of positive Chagas serology in a cohort of pregnant women from Latin-America and its vertical transmission.
   Patients and methods: An observational, prospective, follow-up study was conducted on women with positive serology to T. cruzi, as well as their newborns, from January 2013 to April 2015. Congenital Chagas was ruled out using a PCR technique at birth and at 1 month, and with serology at 9-12 months old. A child was considered infected when PCR was positive, and uninfected when PCR was negative, and/or it had a negative serology.
   Results: Screening was performed on 1244 pregnant women from Latin-America, and there were positive results in 40 (prevalence 3.2%, 95% CI: 2.4-4.4%), with 85% of them from Bolivia. There was only one infected newborn (rate of vertical transmission 2.8% (95% CI: 0-15%)), who had a positive PCR at birth. Relative studies enabled an 8-year-old sister with an asymptomatic disease to be diagnosed and treated. Both were treated successfully with benznidazole (later the PCR and serology were negative).
   Conclusion: Screening during pregnancy in Latin-American women helped to detect those with Chagas disease. The rate of vertical transmission was 2.8%, in keeping with literature. Screening led to the detection and treatment of previously unidentified familial cases. (C) 2016 Asociacion Espanola de Pediatria. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective
   We evaluated the effect of Trypanosoma cruzi infection on fertility, gestation outcome, and maternal-fetal transmission in guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus).
   Methods
   Animals were infected with T. cruzi H4 strain (TcI lineage) before gestation (IBG) or during gestation (IDG). Tissue and sera samples of dams and fetuses were obtained near parturition.
   Results
   All IBG and IDG dams were seropositive by two tests, and exhibited blood parasite load of 1.62 +/- 2.2 and 50.1 +/- 62 parasites/mu l, respectively, by quantitative PCR. Histological evaluation showed muscle fiber degeneration and cellular necrosis in all infected dams. Parasite nests were not detected in infected dams by histology. However, qPCR analysis detected parasites-eq/g heart tissue of 153 +/- 104.7 and 169.3 +/- 129.4 in IBG and IDG dams, respectively. All fetuses of infected dams were positive for anti-parasite IgG antibodies and tissue parasites by qPCR, but presented a low level of tissue inflammatory infiltrate. Fetuses of IDG (vs. IBG) dams exhibited higher degree of muscle fiber degeneration and cellular necrosis in the heart and skeletal tissues. The placental tissue exhibited no inflammatory lesions and amastigote nests, yet parasites-eq/g of 381.2 +/- 34.3 and 79.2 +/- 84.9 were detected in IDG and IBG placentas, respectively. Fetal development was compromised, and evidenced by a decline in weight, crow-rump length, and abdominal width in both groups.
   Conclusions
   T. cruzi TcI has a high capacity of congenital transmission even when it was inoculated at a very low dose before or during gestation. Tissue lesions, parasite load, and fetal under development provide evidence for high virulence of the parasite during pregnancy. Despite finding of high parasite burden by qPCR, placentas were protected from cellular damage. Our studies offer an experimental model to study the efficacy of vaccines and drugs against congenital transmission of T. cruzi. These results also call for T. cruzi screening in pregnant women and adequate follow up of the newborns in endemic areas.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease (CD) or American trypanosomiasis is a neglected anthropozoonosis caused by Trypanosoma cruzi that affects 6-8 million people worldwide (mainly in Latin America), 30-40% of whom develop cardiac or digestive complications. Once confined to endemic areas of Latin America, CD has more recently become a global disease as a result of migration flows from endemic to non-endemic regions, particularly in northern America and Europe. Congenital transmission is a particular challenge as it may be sustained for multiple generations and perpetuate the infection even in non-endemic countries.Methods: Subjects were identified during a cross-sectional survey of CD among Latin American people living in Milan, Italy. Serology was carried out using tests based on either a lysate and a recombinant antigen of Trypanosoma cruzi. They were also tested by a conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) targeting the 330 bp variable region of the T. cruzi kinetoplast minicircle genome and a commercial real-time PCR.Results: We here describe a Bolivian family cluster with seven affected people with at least two autochthonous congenital T. cruzi infection which was identified during the course of a CD screening programme. We also review the epidemiology, diagnosis and control of congenital CD, with particular emphasis on the challenges facing the control and management of such a complex and still largely hidden disease. Conclusions: Our experience confirms the need to screen for CD all family members once a case is diagnosed and shows the possible high rate of congenital CD also in non-endemic areas.

AB  - Objective. To determine the Trypanosoma cruzi infection prevalence in 1125 pregnant women and the transmission frequency to their children from Tapachula and Palenque, Chiapas. Materials and methods. We determined the prevalence by serology tests and the transmission frequency by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and T cruzi reactivity capacity after 12 months. Results. Total maternal infection prevalence were 23/1 125 (2.04%), 9/600 (1.5%) were from Tapachula and 14/525 (2.6%) from Palenque. The seropositive women were between 20 and 35 years old, 31.8% have Premature Rapture of Membrane and 9.1% have history of perinatal death. The total percentage of positive newborns by PCR was 9/23 (39.13%), out of those 2/9 (22.2%) are from Tapachula and 7/14 (50%) from Palenque.The Maternal Fetal transmission frequency was. 2/9 (22.2%) in Tapachula and 1/14 (7.14%) in Palenque, all positive infants were asynthomatic. Conclusion.The maternal-fetal transmission rate in Chiapas State is variable; the reason could be the maternal immunological status and T cruzi strain.

KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Although it is commonly transmitted by an insect vector in continental Latin-America, in recent decades, due migration, has been diagnosed in other countries such Spain, the European country with a largest immigrant population of Latin American. For a long time, the patient remains asymptomatic, but some years after this stage, the symptoms can be serious (dilated cardiomyopathy, megacolon, megaesophagus). In addition, detection in pregnant women has a high priority because of the route of vertical transmission.
   Several specific guidelines about Chagas disease has been developed on the Banks of blood, maternal hospitals, HIV co-infection, organ transplant. But due to the detection of lack of information to primary care professionals, we consider to will be useful this document written and agreed to by family phisicians, pediatricians and specialists in International Health.

AB  - ObjectivesIdentifying pregnant women infected with Trypanosoma cruzi is one of the major challenges for preventing and controlling Chagas disease (CD) in non-endemic countries. The aim of this paper was to perform a policy evaluation of the current practices of congenital Chagas disease (CCD) control in non-endemic countries and to propose specific targets for enhanced interventions to tackle this emerging health problem outside the endemic areas of Latin America.
   MethodsWe conducted a mixed method review of CCD policy strategies by searching the literature in the PubMed, Google Scholar and the World Health Organization (WHO) databases using the key terms CCD', paediatric Chagas disease' and non-endemic countries'; as free text and combined as one phrase to increase the search sensitivity. Reviews, recommendations, guidelines and control/surveillance programme reports were included.
   ResultsOf 427 CCD papers identified in non-endemic countries, 44 matched the inclusion. Although local programmes were launched in different countries with large numbers of Latin American immigrants, there were considerable disparities in terms of the programmes' distribution, delivery, integration and appropriated CCD control strategies. Moreover, Catalonia, Spain is the only region/country with an established systematic monitoring of CCD in pregnant women from Latin American countries.
   ConclusionsGiven the worldwide dissemination of CD, the nature of its vertical transmission, and the gaps of the current strategies in non-endemic countries, there is an urgent need to standardise, expand and reinforce the control measures against CCD transmission.

AB  - To estimate the incidence (any mother to child) and rate (from seropositive mother to child) of mother-to-child transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, a serological census was conducted, targeting pregnant women and infants born to seropositive mothers, in four municipalities of El Salvador. Of 943 pregnant women, 36 (3.8%) were seropositive for T. cruzi. Of 36, 32 proceeded to serological tests of their infants when they became 6-8 months of age. Six infants seropositive at the age of 6-8 months further proceeded to second-stage serological test at the age of 9-16 months. As the result, one infant was congenitally infected. Thus, serological tests at the age of 6-8 months produced five false positives. To ensure earlier effective medication only for true positives, identification of seropositive infants at the age of 9-16 months is crucial. Incidence and rate of mother-to-child transmission were 0.14 (per 100 person-years) and 4.0%, respectively. Estimated number of children infected through mother-to-child transmission in El Salvador (170 per year) was much higher than that of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; seven per year). It is recommended that serological testing for T. cruzi be integrated into those for HIV and syphilis as part of antenatal care package.

KW  - BLOOD
AB  - It is known that the immunoregulatory networks in human Chagas disease play a key role in parasitemia control during the acute phase. However, little is known regarding the control of parasitemia during the chronic phase. The aim of the study was to describe the serum cytokine profile of Trypanosoma cruzi chronically infected patients and to evaluate its relationship with the presence or absence of parasitemia in peripheral blood. This is a prospective observational study where adult Chagas disease patients were included. Patients previously treated for Chagas disease, pregnant women, and immunosuppressed patients were excluded. Demographic and clinical information was collected, and T. cruzi real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serum cytokine profile were determined in peripheral blood. Forty-five patients were included. Trypanosoma cruzi RT-PCR in peripheral blood resulted positive in 19 (42.2%) patients. No differences in the serum cytokine profile were found depending on cardiac or digestive involvement. However, patients with positive T. cruzi RT-PCR had a higher median concentration of IL-10 and IL-1beta and a lower median concentration of IL-8 than those with negative T. cruzi PCR. These results reinforce the key role that this anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) plays in parasitemia control.

AB  - A nationwide survey was conducted to obtain an estimate of Chagas disease prevalence among pregnant women in Ecuador. As part of a national probability sample, 5,420 women seeking care for delivery or miscarriage at 15 healthcare facilities were recruited into the study. A small minority of participants reported knowing about Chagas disease or recognized the vector. A national seroprevalence of 0.1% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.0-0.2%) was found; cases were concentrated in the coastal region (seroprevalence = 0.2%; 95% CI = 0.0-0.4%). No cases of transmission to neonates were identified in the sample. Seropositive participants were referred to the National Chagas Program for evaluation and treatment. Additional studies are necessary to determine if areas of higher prevalence exist in well-known endemic provinces and guide the development of a national strategy for elimination of mother-to-child transmission of Chagas disease in Ecuador.

AB  - Background
   Despite the adoption of campaigns to interrupt the main vector and to detect Trypanosoma cruzi in blood banks, millions of people are still chronically infected; however, the prevalence data are limited, and the epidemiology of Chagas disease has not been systematically evaluated. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of Chagas disease in Colombia.
   Methods
   A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted to select all observational studies reporting the prevalence of Chagas disease in Colombia, based on serological diagnosis in participants of any age and published between January 2007 and November 2017. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using random effects models. In addition, the 12 statistic was calculated.
   Results
   The literature search yielded a total of 1,510 studies; sixteen articles with relevant prevalence data were included in the systematic review. Of these, only 12 articles were included for entry in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of Chagas disease across studies was 2.0% (95% CI: 1.0-4.0). A high degree of heterogeneity was found among studies (I-2 > 75%; p < 0.001). The publication bias was not statistically significant (Egger's test, p = 0.078). The highest pooled prevalences were found in the adult population (3.0%, 95% CI: 1.0-4.0), pregnant women (3.0%, 95% CI: 3.0-4.0) and the Orinoco region (7.0%, 95% CI: 2.2-12.6).
   Conclusions
   The results indicate that the T. cruzi-infected population is aging, the adult population, pregnant women and that the Orinoco region (department of Casanare) have the highest prevalences. These results highlight the need to maintain screening and surveillance programs to identify people with chronic T. cruzi infections.

AB  - Background. Congenital Trypanosoma cruzi transmission is now estimated to account for 22% of new infections, representing a significant public health problem across Latin America and internationally. Treatment during infancy is highly efficacious and well tolerated, but current assays for early detection fail to detect >50% of infected neonates, and 9-month follow-up is low.
   Methods. Women who presented for delivery at 2 urban hospitals in Santa Cruz Department, Bolivia, were screened by rapid test. Specimens from infants of infected women were tested by microscopy (micromethod), quantitative PCR (qPCR), and immunoglobulin (Ig)M trypomastigote excreted-secreted antigen (TESA)-blots at birth and 1 month and by IgG serology at 6 and 9 months.
   Results. Among 487 infants of 476 seropositive women, congenital T. cruzi infection was detected in 38 infants of 35 mothers (7.8%). In cord blood, qPCR, TESA-blot, and micromethod sensitivities/specificities were 68.6%/99.1%, 58.3%/99.1%, and 16.7%/100%, respectively. When birth and 1-month results were combined, cumulative sensitivities reached 84.2%, 73.7%, and 34.2%, respectively. Low birthweight and/or respiratory distress were reported in 11 (29%) infected infants. Infants with clinical signs had higher parasite loads and were significantly more likely to be detected by micromethod.
   Conclusions. The proportion of T. cruzi-infected infants with clinical signs has fallen since the 1990s, but symptomatic congenital Chagas disease still represents a significant, albeit challenging to detect, public health problem. Molecular methods could facilitate earlier diagnosis and circumvent loss to follow-up but remain logistically and economically prohibitive for routine screening in resource-limited settings.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD), caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is considered a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization. Congenital transmission of CD is an increasingly relevant public health problem. It progressively becomes the main transmission route over others and can occur in both endemic and non-endemic countries. Though most congenitally infected newborns are asymptomatic at birth, they display higher frequencies of prematurity, low birth weight, and lower Apgar scores compared to uninfected ones, and some suffer from severe symptoms. If not diagnosed and treated, infected newborns are at risk of developing disabling and life-threatening chronic pathologies later in life. The success or failure of congenital transmission depends on interactions between the parasite, the placenta, the mother, and the fetus. We review and discuss here the current knowledge about these parameters, including parasite virulence factors such as exovesicles, placental tropism, potential placental defense mechanisms, the placental transcriptome of infected women, gene polymorphism, and the maternal and fetal/neonatal immune responses, that might modulate the risk of T. cruzi congenital transmission.

AB  - Congenital infection with Trypanosoma cruzi remains a major route for Chagas disease transmission in endemic and non-endemic regions. We evaluated an intervention strategy aimed to detect congenital Chagas disease cases at a major hospital in the Ecuadorian Amazon via cord blood analysis at the time of delivery. All women giving birth at the hospital during the study period (191) were invited to participate. Among them, two (1.0%) did not adjust to the inclusion criteria and four (2.1%) declined to participate in the study, showing the intervention had good acceptability among the mothers. It was possible to obtain cord blood samples during 146 of the deliveries, and only one woman was found to be seropositive, without evidence of transmission to the newborn at delivery or 8 months later. In addition, sociodemographic and economic characterization of the study population revealed that few women had previous knowledge about Chagas disease (16.1%) whereas more than half (62.5%) recognized the vector. Recognizing the vector and having seen it indoors were associated with women from rural families, involved in agriculture, and hunting in the forest. Interestingly, most women (87.3%) reported having easy access to Ecuador's national health system, suggesting serological screening during prenatal visits would be of value in this province. With a proper prenatal screening system in place, cord blood screening would allow for timely detection of T. cruzi infection in newborns from both seropositive women and the minority (2.1%) of women who do not comply with prenatal care visits.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewChagas disease is endemic to all seven Central American countries, where 12% of the population lives in areas where the disease is a risk. While neglect is a pervasive characteristic of Chagas disease in general, it tends to be especially overlooked in Central America, with more studies and resources devoted to the disease in South America. Here we report on the current epidemiological scenario of Chagas disease in Central America with the objective of presenting a panorama that includes national program details, recent morbidity data, new findings, and events relevant to the disease.Recent FindingsMultinational initiatives and collaborations with external stakeholders that began around the beginning of this century led to the successful elimination of the vector species Rhodnius prolixus, which was last found in Guatemala in 2015. However, acute Chagas disease cases continue to be found in all countries with a surveillance system in place, mainly attributed to Trypanosoma cruzi transmission to humans by the native triatomine species Triatoma dimidiata and Rhodnius pallescens. Serological surveys targeting children have generally found varied T. cruzi infection prevalence, studies of transplacentally transmitted T. cruzi infection in the academic/public sectors have found a few cases in the region, and a new T. cruzi transmission focus was found in western Panama.SummaryChagas disease transmission and prevalence have been reduced in Central America over the past two decades, but there is still much progress to be made toward interruption of T. cruzi transmission to humans by native vector species. Other key areas for improvement are implementing screening for T. cruzi infection in pregnant women, improving reliability of diagnostic tests, expanding access to etiological treatment, and increasing availability and quality of data.

AB  - Background: Vertical transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi infection from mother to infant accounts for a growing proportion of new Chagas disease cases. However, no systematic reviews of risk factors for T. cruzi vertical transmission have been performed.
   Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature in PubMed, LILACS, and Embase databases, following PRISMA guidelines. Studies were not excluded based on language, country of origin, or publication date.
   Results: Our literature review yielded 27 relevant studies examining a wide variety of risk factors, including maternal age, parasitic load, immunologic factors and vector exposure. Several studies suggested that mothers with higher parasitic loads may have a greater risk of vertical transmission. A meta-analysis of 2 studies found a significantly higher parasitic load among transmitting than nontransmitting mothers with T. cruzi infection. A second meta-analysis of 10 studies demonstrated that maternal age was not significantly associated with vertical transmission risk.
   Conclusions: The literature suggests that high maternal parasitic load may be a risk factor for congenital Chagas disease among infants of T. cruzi seropositive mothers. Given the considerable heterogeneity and risk of bias among current literature, additional studies are warranted to assess potential risk factors for vertical transmission of T. cruzi infection.

AB  - Background: Retrospective observational studies suggest that transmission ofTrypanosoma cruzidoes not occur in treated women when pregnant later in life. The level of parasitemia is a known risk factor for congenital transmission. Benznidazole (BZN) is the drug of choice for preconceptional treatment to reduce parasitic load. The fear of treatment-related side effects limits the implementation of the Argentine guideline recommending BZN 60d/300 mg (or equivalent) treatment ofT. cruziseropositive women during the postpartum period to prevent transmission in a future pregnancy. A short and low dose BZN treatment might reduce major side effects and increase compliance, but its efficacy to reduceT. cruziparasitic load compared to the standard 60d/300 mg course is not yet established. Clinical trials testing alternative BZN courses among women of reproductive age are urgently needed.
   Methods and design: We are proposing to perform a double-blinded, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial comparing a short low dose 30-day treatment with BZN 150 mg/day (30d/150 mg) vs. BZN 60d/300 mg. We will recruit not previously treatedT. cruziseropositive women with a live birth during the postpartum period in Argentina, randomize them at 6 months postpartum, and follow them up with the following specific aims:
   Specific aim 1: to measure the effect of BZN 30d/150 mg compared to 60d/300 mg preconceptional treatment on parasitic load measured by the frequency of positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (primary outcome) and by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), immediately and 10 months after treatment.
   Specific aim 2: to measure the frequency of serious adverse events and/or any adverse event leading to treatment interruption.

AB  - In Argentina, around 1500 children are born each year with Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Mother-to-child transmission is the main source of new cases of Chagas disease and of its occurrence in non-endemic areas. Our objective was to survey the information available on congenital T. cruzi infection, to analyze its evolution and its relation with the index of maternal infection and the risk for vector-borne infection by province of Argentina. Data concerning the public health sector for the period 1997-2014 were retrieved from national and local records. An increase in the number and proportion of pregnant women examined for Chagas was observed, reaching 60.3% coverage in 2014. The prevalence of maternal infection dropped from 9.0% to 2.6%. The control of newborns from infected women was highly variable (23.3%-93.6%), and data quality was deficient, varying amply by province and year. The rate of congenital infection had an irregular evolution and its national average fluctuated between 1.9 and 8.2%. An association was observed between the risk for vector-borne infection and the prevalence of maternal infection by province (Wilcoxon test p = 0.017). The rate of congenital transmission by province was neither associated with the rate of maternal infection (linear regression p = 0.686) nor with the risk for vectorial infection (Kruskal-Wallis test p = 0.3154). The available data show insufficient control of children born from infected mothers, as well as deficient recording of these procedures. Both aspects must be improved to achieve better epidemiological information and to enable timely access of infected children to treatment.

AB  - The immigration of Latin American women of childbearing age has spread the congenital transmission of Chagas disease to areas of nonendemicity, and the disease is now a worldwide problem. Some European health authorities have implemented screening programs to prevent vertical transmission, but the lack of a uniform protocol calls for the urgent establishment of a new strategy common to all laboratories. Our aims were to (i) analyze the trend of passive IgG antibodies in the newborn by means of five serological tests for the diagnosis and follow-up of congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection, (ii) assess the utility of these techniques for diagnosing a congenital transmission, and (iii) propose a strategy for a prompt, efficient, and cost-effective diagnosis of T. cruzi infection. In noninfected newborns, a continuous decreasing trend of passive IgG antibodies was observed, but none of the serological assays seroreverted in any the infants before 12 months. From 12 months onwards, serological tests achieved negative results in all the samples analyzed, with the exception of the highly sensitive chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). In contrast, in congenitally infected infants, the antibody decline was detected only after treatment initiation. In order to improve the diagnosis of congenital T. cruzi infection, we propose a new strategy involving fewer tests that allows significant cost savings. The protocol could start 1 month after birth with a parasitological test and/or a PCR. If negative, a serological test would be carried out at 9 months, which if positive, would be followed by another at around 12 months for confirmation.

AB  - Compared with South America, there is a lack of epidemiologic studies about the risk of congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi in Central America and Mexico. It has been suggested that T. cruzi genotypes might differ by region and that congenital transmission might vary according to the parasite's genotype. Our objective was to compare T. cruzi congenital transmission rates in three countries. We performed an observational prospective study in 2011-2014 enrolling women at delivery in one hospital in Argentina, two hospitals in Honduras, and two hospitals in Mexico. Congenital T. cruzi infection was defined as the presence of one or more of the following criteria: presence of parasites in cord blood (direct parasitological microscopic examination) with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in cord blood, presence of parasites in infant's blood at 4-8 weeks (direct parasitological microscopic examination), and persistence of T. cruzi-specific antibodies at 10 months, as measured by at least two tests. Among 28,145 enrolled women, 347 had at least one antibody rapid test positive in cord blood and a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in maternal blood. PCR in maternal blood was positive in 73.2% of the cases, and genotyping identified a majority of non-TcI in the three countries. We found no (0.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0, 2.0) confirmed congenital case in Honduras. Congenital transmission was 6.6% (95% CI: 3.1, 12.2) in Argentina and 6.3% (95% CI: 0.8, 20.8) in Mexico. Trypanosoma cruzi non-TcI predominated and risks of congenital transmission were similar in Argentina and Mexico.

AB  - Background: In 2016, the Hospital Dr. Felix Bulnes Cerda (HDFBC) implemented the mandatory screening of anti Ttypanosorna cruzi antibodies in pregnant women, thus complying with national regulations to detect new Chagas disease cases (CHD) in mother and child, whose early detection mediates timely pharmacological treatment. This, because the congenital transmission continues the main active transmission mechanisms of T. cruzi and a major public health problem for the country. Aim: To present the epidemiological information generated after the implementation of the ECH screening in the SSFCC HFBC, two years after its operation began. Methods: Screening test: inmunequimioluminiscence (IQLU), certification by IFI, ELISA and/or western blot. Follow up of newborn infants with PCR, IFI, ELISA and IQLU. Results: Between April 2016 and july 2018, 14.012 subject's samples were examined of which 62 resulted reactive (0.53% seropositivity) in the total studied population where 28 patients resulted positive for CHD, which corresponds to a 0.2% prevalence. Of the total population, 11.780 were pregnant. women, of these 41 were reactive and 10 were confirmed with CHD thus showing a prevalence of 0.085%. The other 18 positive cases of non-pregnant patients corresponded a prevalence of 0.81%. Also, 10 newborn and infant children of mothers with CHD were followed up. In all, congenital transmission (0%) was ruled out. Nifurtimox treatment of the mothers were completed in 30% of them. It is concluded that the implementation of the program in the HDFBC fulfills the objectives of screening, detection and diagnosis of CHD, so as the timely follow-up and phannacologic treatment of the newborn. The 0.085% prevalence of CHD in pregnant women as the 0.20% in total population are significantly lower (p-valor < 0.01) than the 0.7% reported in 2016 for the Metropolitan Region (MR), a fact that we suggest is a consequence of the national program implementation. Likewise, the 0% transpLacental transmission is accorded to the rate of 0.91 x 10.000 live births reported in 2017 for the MR. Based on the learning acquired during the development of the research, recommendations are given to contribute to the operation of the program.

AB  - Introduction: In recent years, American trypanosomiasis has become an emergent public health problem in countries receiving migrant populations such as Mexico, USA, Canada or those in Europe.
   Objective: To analyze the prevalence of anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies in Latin American migrants on their way to USA and Canada by means of serological techniques.
   Material and methods: ELISA and IHA were performed to detect anti-T. cruzi antibodies. Also, each participant filled out a socioeconomic questionnaire to determine the associated factors with seropositive cases, which could facilitate the transmission in the migrants' country of origin.
   Results: Total seroprevalence among the studied population was 20% (24/120). The highest prevalence was found in migrants from Guatemala with 37.5% (6/16), followed by Honduras (22.6%; 12/53), El Salvador (16%; 4/25), and Mexico (8.7%, 3/23). From the total 120 surveyed migrants, 105 (87.5%) recognized the vector of Chagas' disease, and 62 (59%) assured having been bitten by it. Highly significant statistical associations were found between infection and the construction materials for walls and the presence of pets (dogs) inside houses (p=0.01), as well as with the building materials for backyards, inadequate basic services, and animal breeding inside corrals built around dwellings (p=0.05).
   Conclusion: Non-endemic countries receiving migrants from endemic areas should enhance or develop better health policies to prevent transfusion-transmitted Chagas or congenital parasite transmission.

AB  - Congenital Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is partially responsible for the progressive globalization of Chagas disease despite of its low transmission rate. The probability of congenital transmission depends on complex interactions between the parasite, the maternal and fetus/newborn immune responses and placental factors, being the latter the least studied one.
   During transplacental transmission, the parasite must cross the placental barrier where the trophoblast, a continuous renewing epithelium, is the first tissue to have contact with the parasite. Importantly, the epithelial turnover is considered part of the innate immune system since pathogens, prior to cell invasion, must attach to the surface of cells. The trophoblast turnover involves cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptotic cell death, all of them are induced by the parasite. In the present review, we analyze the current evidence about the trophoblast epithelial turnover as a local placental innate immune response. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chagas disease courses with different clinical phases and has a variable clinical presentation and progression. The acute infection phase mostly exhibits a non-specific symptomatology. in the absence of treatment, the acute phase is followed by a chronic phase, which is initially asymptomatic. This chronic asymptomatic phase of the disease is characterized by a fragile balance between the host's immune response and the parasite replication. The loss of this balance is crucial for the progression of the sickness. The virulence and tropism of the T. cruzi infecting strain together to the inflammation processes in the cardiac tissue are the main factors for the establishment and severity of the cardiomyopathy. The efficacy of treatment in chronic Chagas disease patients is controversial. However, several studies carried out in chronic patients demonstrated that antiparasitic treatment reduces parasite load in the bloodstream and leads to an improvement in the immune response against the Trypanosome cruzi parasite. The present review is mainly focused on the cellular patterns associated to the clinical status and the evolution of the disease in chronic patients, as well as the effectiveness of the treatment related to T. cruzi infection control. Therefore, an emphasis is placed on the dynamics of specific-antigens T cell subpopulations, their memory and activation phenotypes, their functionality and their contribution to pathogenesis or disease control, as well as their association with risk of congenital transmission of the parasite.

AB  - Although Spain is the European country with the highest Chagas disease burden, the country does not have a national control program of the disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of several strategies for Chagas disease screening among Latin American residents living in Spain.
   The following screening strategies were evaluated: (1) non-screening; (2) screening of the Latin American pregnant women and their newborns; (3) screening also the relatives of the positive pregnant women; (4) screening also the relatives of the negative pregnant women. A cost-utility analysis was carried out to compare the four strategies from two perspectives, the societal and the Spanish National Health System (SNHS). A decision tree representing the clinical evolution of Chagas disease throughout patient's life was built. The strategies were compared through the incremental cost-utility ratio, using euros as cost measurement and quality-adjusted life years as utility measurement. A sensitivity analysis was performed to test the model parameters and their influence on the results.
   We found the "Non-screening" as the most expensive and less effective of the evaluated strategies, from both the societal and the SNHS perspectives. Among the screening evaluated strategies the most efficient was, from both perspectives, to extent the antenatal screening of the Latin American pregnant women and their newborns up to the relatives of the positive women. Several parameters influenced significantly on the sensitivity analyses, particularly the chronic treatment efficacy or the prevalence of Chagas disease.
   In conclusion, for the general Latin American immigrants living in Spain the most efficient would be to screen the Latin American mothers, their newborns and the close relatives of the mothers with a positive serology. However for higher prevalence immigrant population the most efficient intervention would be to extend the program to the close relatives of the negative mothers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Congenital transmission (CT) of Trypanosoma cruzi has led to globalization of Chagas disease and its growing relevance as a public health problem. Although the occurrence of CT has been associated with several factors, its mechanisms are still unknown. This study aimed to analyze the geographical and familiar variables of mothers and their association with CT of Chagas disease in a population living in non-endemic areas of Argentina for the last decades. Methods: We developed a retrospective cohort study in a sample of 2120 mother-child pairs who attended three reference centers in the cities of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Salta between 2002 and 2015. Results: The highest CT rates were observed in children born to Argentinean mothers (10.7%) and in children born to mothers from Buenos Aires (11.7%). Considering the areas of origin of the mothers, those from areas of null-low risk for vector-borne infection had higher CT rates than those from areas of medium-high risk (11.1% vs 8.2%). We also observed a significant intra-familiar "cluster effect," with CT rates of 35.9% in children with an infected sibling, compared to 8.2% in children without infected siblings (RR=4.4 95% CI 2.3-8.4). Conclusions: The associations observed suggest a higher CT rate in children born to mothers who acquired the infection congenitally, with familiar antecedents, and from areas without the presence of vectors. These observations are considered new epidemiological evidence about Chagas disease in a contemporary urban population, which may contribute to the study of CT and may also be an interesting finding for healthcare professionals.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, the causing agent of Chagas disease, leads to an activation of the immune system in congenitally infected infants. In this study, we measured a set of cytokines/chemokines and the levels of parasitemia by quantitative PCR in the circulation of neonates born to T. cruzi-infected mothers to evaluate the predictive value of these mediators as biomarkers of congenital transmission. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 35 infants with congenital T. cruzi infection, of which 15 and 10 infants had been diagnosed by detection of parasites by microscopy in the first and sixth month after delivery, respectively, and the remaining 10 had been diagnosed by the presence of T. cruzi-specific Abs at 10-12 mo old. Uninfected infants born to either T. cruzi-infected or uninfected mothers were also evaluated as controls. The plasma levels of IL-17A, MCP-1, and monokine induced by IFN-gamma were increased in infants congenitally infected with T. cruzi, even before they developed detectable parasitemia or seroconversion. Infants diagnosed between 6 and 12 mo old also showed increased levels of IL-6 and IL-17F at 1 mo of age. Conversely, infants who did not develop congenital T. cruzi infection had higher levels of IFN-gamma than infected infants born to uninfected mothers. Monokine induced by IFN-gamma, MCP-1, and IFN-gamma production induced in T. cruzi-infected infants correlated with parasitemia, whereas the plasma levels of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-6 were less parasite load dependent. These findings support the existence of a distinct profile of cytokines and chemokines in the circulation of infants born to T. cruzi-infected mothers, which might predict congenital infection.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is a protozoan infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by triatomine insect vectors in parts of Latin America. In a nonendemic country, such as Canada, spread can still occur via vertical transmission, and infected blood or organ donations. The Canadian Blood Services and Hema-Quebec have both implemented selective screening of blood donors for CD based on risk factors. In 2011, Hema-Quebec identified two seropositive 'at-risk' Chilean siblings who had donated blood in Montreal, Quebec. They were referred to the JD MacLean Centre for Tropical Diseases (Montreal, Quebec) for confirmatory testing (T cruzi excreted-secreted antigen ELISA, polymerase chain reaction and/or radioimmunoprecipitation assay) and follow-up. Screening of the rest of the family revealed two other seropositive family members (the mother and sister). While their geographical history in Chile suggests vectorial transmission, this family cluster of CD raises the possibility of vertical transmission. Congenital infection should always be considered among CD-positive mothers and pregnant women. With blood donor screening, Canadian physicians will increasingly see patients with CD and should know how to manage them appropriately. In addition to the case presentation, the authors review the transmission, screening and clinical management of CD in a nonendemic context.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), the etiological agent of Chagas Disease (CD), is transmitted to humans by infected kissing bugs, blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and from mother-to-child. Congenital transmission is now considered an important route of CD spread in non-endemic countries where no routine testing of pregnant women for the disease is implemented. The main cellular mechanisms that lead to fetal infection by T. cruzi, despite the presence of a placental barrier, remain unclear. Mother-to-child transmission most likely occurs when bloodstream trypomastigotes reach the placental intervillous space and interact with the large cellular surface provided by the syncytioptrophoblasts. These highly specialized cells not only function as a physical obstacle between mother and fetus, but also modulate immune responses against pathogen infections. To overcome the limitations associated with the use of human fetal tissues, we employed a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture model to recreate the human placenta environment. In this system, the trophoblast-derived JEG-3 cell line is co-cultured with human brain microvascular endothelial cells attached to microcarrier beads in a rotating bioreactor. Here, we report that 3D culture of JEG-3/HBMEC spheroids promote JEG-3 cells differentiation revealed by the formation of syncytia and production of beta human chorionic gonadotropin and human placental lactogen (hPL). Under these growth conditions, we demonstrate that 3D-grown JEG-3 cells have reduced susceptibility to T. cruzi infection compared to JEG-3 cells grown in conventional tissue culture flasks. We also show that 3D-cultured JEG-3 cells release paracrine factors in the supernatant that prevent T. cruzi infection of non-trophoblastic cell lines. Our in vitro model of T. cruzi vertical transmission may help better understand the molecular processes by which parasites bypass the human placental barrier and could be exploited to evaluate therapeutics to reduce congenital CD.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) still imposes a heavy burden on most Latin American countries. Vector-borne and mother-to-child transmission cause several thousand new infections per year, and at least 5 million people carry Trypanosoma cruzi. Access to diagnosis and medical care, however, is far from universal. Starting in the 1990s, CD-endemic countries and the Pan American Health Organization-World Health Organization (PAHO-WHO) launched a series of multinational initiatives for CD controlsurveillance. An overview of the initiatives' aims, achievements, and challenges reveals some key common themes that we discuss here in the context of the WHO 2030 goals for CD. Transmission of T. cruzi via blood transfusion and organ transplantation is effectively under control. T. cruzi, however, is a zoonotic pathogen with 100+ vector species widely spread across the Americas; interrupting vector-borne transmission seems therefore unfeasible. Stronger surveillance systems are, and will continue to be, needed to monitor and control CD. Prevention of vertical transmission demands boosting current efforts to screen pregnant and childbearing-aged women. Finally, integral patient care is a critical unmet need in most countries. The decades-long experience of the initiatives, in sum, hints at the practical impossibility of interrupting vector-borne T. cruzi transmission in the Americas. The concept of disease control seems to provide a more realistic description of what can in effect be achieved by 2030.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is divided into six Discrete Typing Units (DTUs): TcI-TcVI. We aimed to identify T. cruzi DTUs in Latin-American migrants in the Barcelona area (Spain) and to assess different molecular typing approaches for the characterization of T. cruzi genotypes. Seventy-five peripheral blood samples were analyzed by two real-time PCR methods (qPCR) based on satellite DNA (SatDNA) and kinetoplastid DNA (kDNA). The 20 samples testing positive in both methods, all belonging to Bolivian individuals, were submitted to DTU characterization using two PCR-based flowcharts: multiplex qPCR using TaqMan probes (MTq-PCR), and conventional PCR. These samples were also studied by sequencing the SatDNA and classified as type I (TcI/III), type II (TclI/IV) and type I/II hybrid (TcV/VI). Ten out of the 20 samples gave positive results in the flowcharts: TcV (5 samples), TcII/V/VI (3) and mixed infections by TcV plus TclI (1) and TcV plus Tcll/VI (1). By SatDNA sequencing, we classified the 20 samples, 19 as type I/II and one as type I. The most frequent DTU identified by both flowcharts, and suggested by SatDNA sequencing in the remaining samples with low parasitic loads, TcV, is common in Bolivia and predominant in peripheral blood. The mixed infection by TcV-TclI was detected for the first time simultaneously in Bolivian migrants. PCR-based flowcharts are very useful to characterize DTUs during acute infection. SatDNA sequence analysis cannot discriminate T. cruzi populations at the level of a single DTU but it enabled us to increase the number of characterized cases in chronically infected patients.

TI  - Congenital transmission of Chagas disease in a non-endemic area, is an early diagnosis possible?
T2  - PLOS ONE

KW  - TRYPANOSOMA-CRUZI
AB  - Background
   Chagas disease (CD) is an emergent disease in Europe, due to immigration. The aims of this study are to describe the epidemiological characteristics of a cohort of Chagas infected pregnant women in Spain, to assess the vertical transmission (VT) rate and evaluate the usefulness of the PCR in the diagnosis of congenital infection in the first months of life.
   Methods
   A descriptive, retrospective study including Chagas seropositive pregnant women who were attended at three tertiary hospitals in Madrid, from January 2012 to September 2016. Infants were examined by PCR at birth and 1 month later and serologically studied at 9 months or later. Children were considered infected when the parasite was detected by PCR at any age or when serology remained positive without decline over the age of 9 months.
   Results
   We included 122 seropositive-infected pregnant women, 81% were from Bolivia and only 8.2% had been treated before. 125 newborns were studied and finally 109 were included (12.8% lost the follow-up before performing the last serology). The VT rate was 2.75% (95% CI: 0,57-8,8%). Infected infants had positive PCR at birth and 1 month later. All of them were treated successfully with benznidazole (PCR and serology became negative later on). All non-infected children presented negative PCR. The mean age at which uninfected patients had negative serology was 10.5 months.
   Conclusions
   The VT rate is in keeping with literature and confirms the need to carry out a screening in pregnant women coming from endemic areas. PCR seems to be a useful tool to provide early diagnosis of congenital

AB  - Background: Chagas disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi is endemic in Latin America. Human infection is mainly spread by Triatominae insects. Other forms of transmission are congenital, blood transfusion and organ transplantation.
   Methods: Anti-T. cruzi antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot (WB) in 155 serum samples from mothers and their babies. Indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) and a commercial test were used to validate efficacy of a specific ELISA-iron-excreted superoxide dismutase assay. Sera from babies were collected at 6 and 12 months, whereas maternal samples were obtained after delivery. Calostrum and umbilical cord samples were simultaneously obtained.
   Results: Anti-T. cruzi antibodies were detected in 8 (5.16%) mothers by ELISA-WB, in 7 (4.51%) using IFA and in 1 (0.64%) by a commercial kit. Nine (5.80%) 6-month-old children were positive by ELISA-WB and 7 (4.51%) by IFA; negative results were obtained when the commercial kit was used. At 12 month of age, 15 (9.67%) children were positive by ELISA-WB, 13 (8.38%) by IFA and 1 (0.64%) by the commercial test. Antibodies were detected in 4 mothers whose children were serologically negative. Four other mothers and their children were positive, but only one of them had detected antibodies in umbilical cord up to 12 months, thus assuming vertical transmission.
   Conclusions: The use of iron-excreted superoxide dismutase as antigen in serologic tests for detection of T. cruzi yielded promising results as diagnostic procedure.

AB  - Background. It is currently unclear why only a proportion of children born to Trypanosoma cruzi-infected mothers acquire the infection. We have examined the association of 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in genes coding for placental expression enzymes as genetic markers of susceptibility to congenital T. cruzi infection (hereafter, "congenital infection"): rs2014683 and rs1048988 in ALPP; rs11244787 and rs1871054 in ADAM12; rs243866, rs243865, rs17859821, rs243864, and rs2285053 in MMP2; and rs3918242 and rs2234681 in MMP9.
   Methods. Two groups of children born to mothers seropositive for T. cruzi were compared: 101 had congenital infection, and 116 were uninfected. Novel high-resolution melting and capillary electrophoresis genotyping techniques were designed and used.
   Results. Logistic regression analysis showed that mutations in rs11244787 and rs1871054 (in ADAM12) and rs243866, rs17859821, and rs2285053 (in MMP2) were associated with susceptibility to congenital infection. Multifactor dimensionality reduction revealed that genotyping results for rs11244787, rs1871054, rs243866, rs17859821 and rs243864 sites would be a good predictor of congenital infection.
   Conclusions. Our results suggest an important role of human polymorphisms in proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and the immune response during congenital infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the association between mutations in placentally expressed genes and susceptibility to congenital infection.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to perform a serological screening for T. cruzi, Strongyloides stercoralis, HIV, human T cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) and syphilis in Latin American immigrants admitted to hospital in Spain.
   Methods: We have carried out a cross-sectional study of Latin American immigrants admitted to the Hospital General Universitario Alicante (Spain) from June 2012 to May 2014, where screening of Chagas disease, strongyloidiasis, HTLV, HIV and syphilis was performed by serology.
   Results: A total 180 patients were included in the study. Patients' median age was 38 years old, 123 (68.3%; 123/180) were female and 57 (31.7%; 57/180) male. Five of the 180 (2.5%) patients were positive for Chagas disease; associated with knowledge about Chagas disease (p=0.005), previous contact with patients with Chagas disease (p=0.04) and being Bolivian (p<0.001). Forty-two of the 157 (26.8%) patients were positive for Strongyloides serology; associated positively with being male (p<0.001), eosinophilia (p=0.001), hyper-IgE (p<0.001) and being Ecuadorian (p=0.001), and negatively associated with being Colombian (p=0.03). Positive serology of latent syphilis was found in 1.8% (3/171) of patients. Serology of HTLV was negative in all cases. No new cases of HIV infection were diagnosed.
   Conclusions: We propose that Latin American immigrant patients admitted to hospital in Spain be screened for strongyloidiasis, Chagas disease and syphilis by serology.

AB  - Congenital infection is those transmitted by the mother to the fetus before delivery. It can occur transplacentally or by direct contact with the pathogen during birth or in the immediate postnatal period. Congenital infection can be due to viruses (rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, hepatitis B and C virus, human inunodeficiencia, erythrovirus B19) as bacteria (Treponema pallidum) and parasites (Toxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma cruzi). Serological diagnosis of congenital infection is based on both the knowledge of infectious serology in the mother, including the systematic serological screening and diagnostic aspects of the determination of IgM and confirmatory methods, IgG avidity tests, establishment of antibody profiles, and in the diagnosis the neonate. Serological diagnosis of congenital infection in the newborn is mainly based on the detection of specific IgM usually by immunoenzymatic assays or immunochemiluminescence techniques. In some instances it is important to perform the serological follow up of the newborn to confirm the congenital infection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease has spread beyond its original borders on the American continent with migration. It can be transmitted from mother to child, through organ transplantation and transfusion of blood and blood products. It is necessary to determine when to screen for this infection. Aim: Our objective was to evaluate the appropriateness of screening for Trypanosoma cruzi infection in Latin American migrants and their descendants. Methods: We reviewed the literature using rigorous criteria. The quality of evidence was ranked according to the GRADE classification. An evidence to decision framework was adopted to provide information on the most relevant aspects necessary to formulate recommendations. Results: The 33 studies evaluated revealed a prevalence of T. cruzi infection among Latin American migrants in Europe of 6.08% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.24-9.69; 28 studies). Vertical transmission occurred in three of 100 live births (95% CI: 1-6; 13 studies). The prevalence of cardiovascular disease was 19% (95% CI: 13-27; nine studies), including only 1% severe cardiac events (95% CI: 0-2; 11 studies). The overall quality of evidence was low because of risk of bias in the studies and considerable heterogeneity of the evaluated populations. The recommendations took into account economic studies on the value of screening strategies and studies on acceptability of screening and knowledge of the disease in the affected population. Conclusions: We identified five situations in which screening for T. cruzi infection is indicated. We recommend screening persons from endemic areas and children of mothers from these areas.

AB  - Purpose of reviewWith the rise of HIV, its impact on tropical infections has been undeniable. The presence of some tropical pathogens can facilitate the transmission of HIV, whereas untreated HIV infection can lead to the earlier and more severe presentation of a variety of tropical diseases and can make their treatment more challenging. Although the quality and availability of antiretroviral therapy has advanced significantly over the last two decades, it may not be readily available to all populations in low-resource regions.Recent findingsIn addition, very little research has been done regarding drug interactions between antiretroviral therapy and medications used to treat tropical diseases.SummaryThis article reviews existing data on coinfections of the most common tropical diseases and HIV, as well as current strategies for their treatment and control.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease (CD), is a parasitic disease endemic in Latin America. Presentation in non-endemic areas is either in the asymptomatic indeterminate phase or the chronic phase with cardiac and/or gastrointestinal complications.
   Methods: The Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD) based in central London, provides tertiary care for the management of CD. We reviewed all cases managed at this centre between 1995 and 2018.
   Results: Sixty patients with serologically proven CD were identified. Most were female (70%), with a median age at diagnosis of 41 years. Three quarters of the patients were originally from Bolivia. 62% of all patients were referred to the HTD by their GP. Nearly half of the patients were asymptomatic (47%). Twelve patients had signs of cardiac involvement secondary to CD. Evidence of gastrointestinal damage was established in three patients. Treatment was provided at HTD for 31 patients (47%). Most patients (29) received benznidazole, five of them did not tolerate the course and were switched to nifurtimox. Of the seven patients receiving this second line drug, five completed treatment, whilst two interrupted it due to side effects.
   Conclusions: Despite the UK health system having all the resources required to diagnose, treat and follow up cases, there is lack of awareness of CD, such that the vast majority of cases remain undiagnosed and therefore do not receive treatment. We propose key interventions to improve the detection and management of this condition in the UK, especially in pregnant women and neonates.

AB  - Background
   The National Army of Colombia is present in all of the national territory, focused in sylvatic zones where they are exposed continually to potential risk of transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of the Chagas disease. People of this study were active personal that were born and lived during their first years in endemic areas of transmission through domiciled vectors as Rhodnius prolixus.
   Aim
   The main aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of Chagas disease in the active military population of the National Army, gathered in five departments.
   Methods
   An observational and descriptive study with cross-sectional analysis was carried out. Blood sample each patient in order to apply serological diagnosis by two different Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay tests, following the algorithm of National Institute of Health, Colombia. In cases of serum results with inconsistencies, a Hemagglutination Inhibition test and Indirect Immunofluorescence assay test were performed to solve inconclusiveness. Positive samples by two different tests were considered seropositive. Additionally, to each positive sample by at least one serological test, we did extraction of DNA for molecular diagnosis.
   Results
   295 serums were analyzed and two of them were positive in order to get a prevalence of 0.68%. Two samples analyzed by molecular diagnosis were negative.
   Conclusion
   The prevalence was < 1% It is probable the infection in the seropositive individuals occurred before enlisting in the military service due to origin locations with transmission such as Casanare and Boyaca. These findings allow defining the prevention and control programs of chronic cases and reduction in the disease burden.

AB  - Chagas disease, which is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is considered to be the most serious parasitic disease in America. It is transmitted mainly by triatominae ("kissing bugs"). Mazzoti reported the first two human cases in Mexico. The form of transmission is by parasites entering the organism in feces of the insect, by blood transfusion, from mother to child, by organ transplant and laboratory accidents. In Mexico, 1.1 million people are estimated to be infected; the incidence in 2012 was 0.70 per 1,00,000 population. In 2017, the highest incidence rates were registered in Yucatan, Oaxaca and Hidalgo. The infection causes cardiomyopathies and mega-organs of the digestive tract. Diagnosis in the acute phase is by parasitological approach and, in the chronic phase, by laboratory screening studies. In Mexico's blood banks, screening for Chagas disease is mandatory; from 2007 to 2016, seroprevalence has decreased from 0.40 to 0.32 due to the improvement of donor selection processes and the ad hoc questionnaire. The targets of the parasite are neurons and smooth and myocardial muscle cells. The association of neuronal and smooth muscle destruction defines the presentation of chagas mega-syndromes. Initial manifestations of the disease can go unnoticed; 5% show apparent signs and symptoms and 30% will progress to the chronic asymptomatic phase. Currently available treatments have effect in the acute phase. For the control of Chagas disease, the Specific Action Program for the Prevention and Control of Chagas Disease (PAE Chagas 2013-2018) is available to initiate activities aimed at eliminating transfusion and congenital transmission and controlling vector transmission. The success of medical care depends on oportune detection, early etiological treatment and coverage broadening. On the other hand, monitoring and screening of pregnant women living in risk areas and blood and organ donors universal screening will enable the elimination congenital and transfusion transmission.

AB  - The aim of this work was to obtain a reagent based on latex particles for ruling out acute toxoplasmosis in pregnant women by immunoagglutination (IA). Latex-protein complexes (LPC) were previously synthesized coupling the recombinant protein of Toxoplasma gondii P22Ag and the homogenate of the parasite to latex particles with different size, chemical functionality and charge density. LPC were tested in IA assays against a panel of 72 pregnant women serum samples. Results were analysed through receiver operating characteristic curves, determining area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV, respectively). It was observed that the antigenicity of proteins was not affected during sensitization by either physical adsorption or covalent coupling. The best results in the sense of maximizing discrimination of low avidity sera from chronic ones were observed for the IA test based on latex particles with carboxyl functionality and the recombinant P22Ag, obtaining an AUC of 0.94, a sensitivity of 100% and a NPV of 100%. In this way, the proposed test could be useful for the toxoplasmosis diagnosis in pregnant women, with the advantages of being cheap, rapid and easy to be implemented.

AB  - Human migration has been identified as a potential factor for increased Chagas disease risk and has transformed the disease from a Latin American problem to a global one. We conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature between 2004-2014 in order to: summarize recent seroprevalence estimates of Chagas disease among Latin American migrants, in both endemic and non-endemic settings; compare seroprevalence estimates in migrants to countrywide prevalence estimates; and identify risk factors for Chagas disease among migrants. A total of 320 studies were screened and 23 studies were included. We found evidence that the prevalence of Chagas disease is higher than expected in some migrant groups and that reliance on blood donor screening prevalence estimates underestimates the burden of disease. Overall there is a dearth of high quality epidemiologic studies on the prevalence of Chagas disease in migrants, especially among intra-regional migrants within Latin America. Given that this zoonotic disease cannot likely be eradicated, improved surveillance and reporting is vital to continuing control efforts. More accurate health surveillance of both Latin American migrants and the Chagas disease burden will help countries appropriately scale up their response to this chronic disease. Overall, improved estimates of Chagas disease among migrants would likely serve to highlight the real need for better screening, diagnostics, and treatment of individuals living with the disease.

AB  - Introduction: With the globalization of Chagas disease, unexperienced health care providers may have difficulties in identifying which patients should be examined for this condition. This study aimed to develop and validate a diagnostic clinical prediction model for chronic Chagas disease. Methods: This diagnostic cohort study included consecutive volunteers suspected to have chronic Chagas disease. The clinical information was blindly compared to serological tests results, and a logistic regression model was fit and validated. Results: The development cohort included 602 patients, and the validation cohort included 138 patients. The Chagas disease prevalence was 19.9%. Sex, age, referral from blood bank, history of living in a rural area, recognizing the kissing bug, systemic hypertension, number of siblings with Chagas disease, number of relatives with a history of stroke, ECG with low voltage, anterosuperior divisional block, pathologic Q wave, right bundle branch block, and any kind of extrasystole were included in the final model. Calibration and discrimination in the development and validation cohorts (ROC AUC 0.904 and 0.912, respectively) were good. Sensitivity and specificity analyses showed that specificity reaches at least 95% above the predicted 43% risk, while sensitivity is at least 95% below the predicted 7% risk. Net benefit decision curves favor the model across all thresholds. Conclusions: A nomogram and an online calculator (available at http://shiny.ipec.fiocruz.br:3838/pedrobrasil/chronic_chagas_disease_prediction/) were developed to aid in individual risk estimation.

AB  - Introduction: Argentina has been a preferential target for Bolivian immigrants for decades. The relatively recent migratory flux includes Germany, France, the United States, Australia, Japan, and some Latin American countries. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to describe the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women, analyzing the Bolivian-specific Chagas prevalence as the main contributor of migratory populations from Chagas disease-endemic areas to Buenos Aires city, Argentina, and to evaluate the impact of these migrant influxes on the process of the "urbanization" of the disease in reference hospital Jose Maria Ramos Mejia (JMRM).
   Methodology: Overall, 21,332 pregnant women (100%) between 15 and 49 years of age derived from the public maternity service of JMRMH were studied. Serology data was obtained from registered serological diagnosis data, consisting of three different serological tests performed at the Public Parasitology Unit.
   Results: Although general prevalence decreased during the analyzed period, the specific prevalence of pregnant women from Bolivian origin showed a sustained growth during 1983-2013. Solely 5% of the total pregnant women population from Bolivia contributed to one third of the total Chagas prevalence.
   Conclusions: This study showed that a cohort of pregnant women from Bolivia who attended JMRMH during the period 1983-2007 constituted a population at risk for congenital transmission. Increased migration from endemic areas of Bolivia might potentially increase the prevalence of Chagas disease among pregnant women. In addition, this study highlights the importance to analyze specific prevalence according to endemic areas to determine the profiles of potential hidden prevalence.

AB  - Background
   Few studies have assessed the burden of Chagas disease in non-endemic countries and most of them are based on prevalence estimates from Latin American (LA) countries that likely differ from the prevalence in migrants living in Europe. The aim of this study was to systematically review the existing data informing current understanding of the prevalence of Chagas disease in LA migrants living in European countries.
   Methods
   We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting prevalence of Chagas disease in European countries belonging to the European Union (EU) before 2004 in accordance with the MOOSE guidelines and based on the database sources MEDLINE and Global Health. No restrictions were placed on study date, study design or language of publication. The pooled prevalence was estimated using random effect models based on DerSimonian & Laird method.
   Results
   We identified 18 studies conducted in five European countries. The random effect pooled prevalence was 4.2% (95%CI:2.2-6.7%); and the heterogeneity of Chagas disease prevalence among studies was high (I2 = 97%, p<0.001). Migrants from Bolivia had the highest prevalence of Chagas disease (18.1%, 95% CI:13.9-22.7%).
   Conclusions
   Prevalence of Chagas in LA migrants living in Europe is high, particularly in migrants from Bolivia and Paraguay. Data are highly heterogeneous dependent upon country of origin and within studies of migrants from the same country of origin. Country-specific prevalence differs from the estimates available from LA countries. Our meta-analysis provides prevalence estimates of Chagas disease that should be used to estimate the burden of disease in European countries.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease. Nowadays, the transmission in Brazil occurs mainly by oral ingestion of contaminated food that has been associated with more severe clinical manifestations. We report a case of Acute Chagas disease caused by oral transmission in a child from Northern Brazil. In the hospital admission, physical examination showed tachycardia, hepatomegaly. bipalpebral edema and anasarca. Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes were found in microscopy during blood cell count. Twenty-three days before hospitalization, the child had ingested the "bacaba palm fruit's wine". Even with the appropriate diagnosis and starting of treatment, she did not survive. Quantitative analysis of Trypanosoma cruzi DNA in a blood sample resulted in 54,053.42 parasite equivalents/mL and the DTU TcIV was identified. The outcome may have been determined by several factors, including the delay to seek a medical service beyond the high parasitemia, detected by qPCR. DTU TcIV could also have influenced the natural history of the disease.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas disease surveillance requires current knowledge on synanthropic triatomines. We analyzed the occurrence and Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates of triatomine bugs in central Brazil, during 2012-2014. Methods: Triatomines were collected inside or around houses, and T. cruzi infection was determined by optical microscopy and conventional/quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Of the 2706 triatomines collected, Triatoma sordida was the most frequent species in Goias State, whereas Panstrongylus megistus predominated in the Federal District. Parasites identified were T. cruzi, T. rangeli, and Blastocrithidia sp. Conclusions: P. megistus and T. sordida sustained the risk of T. cruzi transmission to humans in central Brazil.

KW  - Trypanosoma cruzi infection
AB  - Purpose of review Lack of recognition of congenital Chagas disease in infants of mothers from endemic regions who are living in countries nonendemic for Trypanosoma cruzi infection suggests a high rate of underdiagnosis. Pregnancy is the optimal access point for identifying Chagas disease in at-risk mothers and their infants. In this review, we update progress toward implementation of pregnancy-based screening for congenital Chagas disease in nonendemic settings. Recent findings International organizations have updated recommendations for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of congenital Chagas disease. Reports of successful implementation of pregnancy-based screening at some centers provide a model for optimizing diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease. Screening family members of index patients may identify additional T. cruzi-infected persons. Promising tests to augment current diagnostic modalities for maternal and congenital Chagas disease are in development. Universal or risk-based screening would be cost-effective. More healthcare providers are now aware that treatment of congenital Chagas disease is curative and are promoting efforts to make pregnancy-based screening for congenital Chagas disease a standard of care. Ongoing efforts to implement routine pregnancy-based screening for congenital Chagas disease in nonendemic regions will mutually benefit infants, their mothers and family members and can prevent potentially fatal Chagas cardiomyopathy.

AB  - With the urbanisation of the population in developing countries and the process of globalisation, Chagas has become an emerging disease in the urban areas of endemic and non-endemic countries. In 2006, it was estimated that the prevalence of Chagas disease among the general Bolivian population was 6.8%. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection among Bolivian immigrants living in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This study had a sample of 633 volunteers who were randomly selected from the clientele of primary care units located in the central districts of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Infection was detected by two different ELISA assays with epimastigote antigens, followed by an immunoblot with trypomastigote antigens as a confirmatory test. The prevalence of the infection was 4.4%. Risk factors independently associated with the infection were: a history of rural jobs in Bolivia, knowledge of the vector involved in transmission, and having relatives with Chagas disease. Brazil has successfully eliminated household vector transmission of T. cruzi, as well as its transmission by blood transfusion. The arrival of infected immigrants represents an additional challenge to primary care clinics to manage chronic Chagas disease, its vertical transmission, and the blood derivatives and organ transplant programs.

AB  - Introduction: This study estimated the seroprevalence and risk factors of Chagas disease (CD) in a population of the Quixere municipality, Ceara. Methods: We conducted serological methods to detect the Trypanosoma cruzi infection. The other variables were evaluated by a standardized questionnaire. Results: The estimated prevalence of CD was 3.7%. Male sex, age >40 years, being farmers, low education level, origin from rural areas, and being born in Quixere were significantly associated with infection. Conclusion: CD persists in this rural population of Northeast Brazil. Poverty, low education, and limited information regarding CD are critical issues that need to be addressed.

AB  - In 2016 more than 700 000 asylum requests were registered in Germany. The most common country of origin was Syria. The proportion of migrating women was reported with 20 to 35 % in different observations. Pregnancies among female migrants must be expected in 3,5 %. Diagnostic approaches should focus on risk factors for an adverse course of pregnancy. In respect on the spectrum of infectious diseases tuberculosis and parasitic infections must be of special concern. bilharzia and malaria are relevant in migrants from Africa. In Latin Americans Chagas' disease is in the foreground. Recent studies elucidating the spectrum of disease in pregnant female migrants are not available.

AB  - We report the results of a targeted testing strategy for five emerging infectious diseases (Chagas disease, human T-lymphotropic virus 1 infection, malaria, schistosomiasis, and Zika virus infection) in pregnant women accessing an Italian referral centre for infectious diseases in pregnancy for unrelated reasons. The strategy is based on a quick five-question questionnaire which allows the identification of pregnant women at risk who should be tested for a specific disease. One hundred and three (24%) out of 429 pregnant women evaluated in a 20 month period were at risk for at least one emerging infectious disease. Three (2.9%, all from sub-Saharan Africa) out of 103 at-risk women resulted in being affected (one case of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, two cases of schistosomiasis) and were appropriately managed. Prevalence of emerging infectious disease was particularly high in pregnant women from Africa (three out of 25 pregnant women tested, 12%). The proposed strategy could be used by health care professionals managing pregnant women in non-endemic setting, to identify those at risk for one of the five infection which could benefit for a targeted test and treatment.

AB  - Triatoma costalimai Verano & Galvao, a little-known vector of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, occupies rocky environments in the Brazilian Cerrado and occasionally infests man-made habitats. Entomological surveillance records show that T. costalimai occurs fairly often inside and around houses in southeastern Tocantins, Brazil, with 859 specimens reported in 2005-2014. Most adults were caught indoors, and breeding colonies were found inside and around houses. Trypanosoma cruzi was detected in 13.7% of 839 bugs. These data suggest that T. costalimai can contribute to T. cruzi transmission in human environments, underscoring the need for long-term entomological-epidemiological surveillance wherever native Chagas disease vectors occur.

AB  - Congenital Chagas disease is considered a form of dispersion of Trypanosoma cruzi related to human migration from endemic, often rural to previously nonendemic urban areas. This fact increases the Chagas disease establishment risk inside of family members by vertical transmission pathway. Congenital Chagas disease cases in newborns could not identified by the health professional even in endemic regions. Here we present the first family cluster of Chagas disease cases from Chiapas: one of the most important endemic areas in South of Mexico, where vertical T. cruzi transmission incidence rate is ranged between 2% to 22% revealing an important public health problem. Two cases inside a family from Chiapas, Mexico with positive antibodies against T. cruzi detected by ELISA are presented; one of them got the infection through vertical pathway. We think that congenital Chagas disease should not be ignored in a newborn born from an asymptomatic Chagas disease mother, who may transmit the parasite infection randomly.

AB  - Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and affects about two to three million people in Brazil, still figuring as an important public health problem. A study was conducted in a rural area of the municipality of Limoeiro do Norte - CE, northeastern Brazil, aiming to determine the prevalence of T. cruzi infection. Of the inhabitants, 52% were examined, among whom 2.6% (4/154) were seropositive in at least two serological tests. All seropositive individuals were older than 50 years, farmers, with a low education and a family income of less than three minimum wages. Active surveillance may be an alternative for early detection of this disease.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasitic protozoan that infects a diversity of hosts constituting the cycle of enzootic transmission in wild environments and causing disease in humans (Chagas disease) and domestic animals. Wild mammals constitute natural reservoirs of this parasite, which is transmitted by hematophagous kissing bugs of the family Reduviidae. T. cruzi is genetically subdivided into six discrete typing units (DTUs), T. cruzi (Tc)I to TcVI. In Brazil, especially in the state of Parana, TcI and TcII are widely distributed. However, TcII is less frequently found in wild reservoirs and triatomine, and more frequently found in patients. The goal of this study was to investigate the natural occurrence of T. cruzi in wild synanthropic mammals captured in urban forest fragments of the Atlantic Forest of Parana, southern Brazil. In this way, 12 opossums and 35 bats belonging to five species were captured in urban forest parks of the city of Maringa, Parana, an area considered endemic for Chagas disease. PCR-kinetoplast DNA molecular diagnostic reveals Trypanosoma sp. infection in 12 (100%) Didelphis albiventris and 10 (40%) Artibeus lituratus. In addition to demonstrating the presence of Trypanosoma in the two groups of mammals studied, we obtained an isolate of the parasite genotyped as TcII by amplification of the cytochrome oxidase II gene by PCR, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism with AluI, and confirmed by PCR of rDNA 24S alpha. This is the first record of the encounter in wild mammals of Trypanosoma DNA (in A. lituratus) and T. cruzi DTU TcII (in D. albiventris) in the state of Parana.

AB  - Chagas disease is underappreciated as a health concern in the United States. Approximately 40 000 women of childbearing age living in the United States have chronic Chagas disease. Most of them are unaware that they have an infection that is transmissible to their offspring. The estimated US maternal-to-infant transmission rate of Trypanosoma cruzi is 1% to 5%. Ten percent to 40% of neonates with congenital T cruzi infection have clinical signs consistent with a congenital infection but no findings are unique to Chagas disease. If left untreated, 20% to 40% of infants with Chagas disease will later develop potentially fatal cardiac manifestations. Molecular testing can confirm the diagnosis in neonates. Treatment is well tolerated in infancy and usually results in cure. Screening of at-risk women during pregnancy can identify maternal infection and allow early assessment and treatment for congenital T cruzi infection.

AB  - Gaspar Vianna is considered one of the great names in Medicine and Science in Brazil. Yet, little prominence has been given to his studies in Neuropathology. He was the first to describe, in 1911, the histopathology and pathogenesis of chagasic encephalitis in the acute phase of Chagas disease, as well as the intracellular life cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi. Over 100 years have elapsed and Gaspar Vianna's pioneering study remains an example of a meticulous and still up-to-date description of central nervous system involvement in the acute phase of Chagas disease.

AB  - Chagas disease reactivation has been a defining condition for acquired immune deficiency syndrome in Brazil for individuals coinfected with Trypanosome cruzi and HIV since 2004. Although the first coinfection case was reported in the 1980s, its prevalence has not been firmly established. In order to know coinfection prevalence, a cross-sectional study of 200 HIV patients was performed between January and July 2013 in the city of Pelotas, in southern Rio Grande do Sul, an endemic area for Chagas disease. Ten subjects were found positive for T. cruzi infection by chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay and indirect immunofluorescence. The survey showed 5% coinfection prevalence among HIV patients (95% CI: 2.0-8.0), which was 3.8 times as high as that estimated by the Ministry of Health of Brazil. Six individuals had a viral load higher than 100,000 copies per mu L, a statistically significant difference for T. cruzi presence. These findings highlight the importance of screening HIV patients from Chagas disease endemic areas. (C) 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

AB  - Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Seven lineages have been identified based on different molecular markers, namely TcI, TcII, TcIII, TcIV, TcV, TcVI, and TcBat. Dogs play the role of epidemiological sentinels being domestic reservoirs of T. cruzi. The aim of the current study was to report the first case of CD in a domestic dog in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, infected with T. cruzi DTU TcIV. We hope our report encourages veterinarians and surveillance professionals to a take a deeper look at T. cruzi infection in domestic animals.

AB  - Based on the literature, this work aimed to discuss infection by Chagas disease among blood donors in Brazil. Studies on the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in donors or candidates for blood donation in Brazil are important. The prevalence of infection appears to be a sensitive indicator and can be a true marker of the risk of the transmission of Chagas disease by blood transfusion. Moreover, it serves as a marker of the level of transmission of the disease in a region, as well as a tool to characterize the epidemiological profile of individuals affected by the disease. The present study is an integrative review of the literature on chagasic infection among blood donors. An evaluation of the literature identified the epidemiological profile of blood donors infected by T. cruzi, which is characterized in general as men, over 30 years old, with a low level of schooling, low income and mainly coming from rural areas.

We analyzed the occurrence of triatomines in the Itauna micro-regions for healthcare. Methods: Data were collected as part of routine entomological surveillance activities, including the species identity, capture site, developmental stage, and trypanosome infection. Results: In total, 503 specimens from five species were captured (495 P. megistus). Adults were mainly captured by residents inside their homes, whereas nymphs were mostly captured by public health professionals outside. Conclusions: The epidemiologically important triatomine, P. megistus, continues to persist in our study region.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is an endemic anthropozoonosis from Latin America of which the main means of transmission is the contact of skin lesions or mucosa with the feces of triatomine bugs infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. In this article, we describe the first acute CD case acquired by vector transmission in the Rio de Janeiro State and confirmed by parasitological, serological and PCR tests. The patient presented acute cardiomyopathy and pericardial effusion without cardiac tamponade. Together with fever and malaise, a 3 cm wide erythematous, non-pruritic, papule compatible with a "chagoma" was found on his left wrist. This case report draws attention to the possible transmission of CD by non-domiciled native vectors in non-endemic areas. Therefore, acute CD should be included in the diagnostic workout of febrile diseases and acute myopericarditis in Rio de Janeiro.

AB  - This is a case report about the only confirmed death in the State of Espirito Santo due to acute Chagas-related myocarditis in a 2-year-old child living in the rural area of Guarapari. He presented with fever, abdominal pain, headache, and vomiting, resulting in death 21 days after the presentation of symptoms. Amastigote forms were observed in the myocardial fibers in histological examination. The boy's mother had reported finding "kissing bugs" in the child's hand. This case highlights the need to include Chagas disease in the differential diagnosis in health care to provide early treatment and avoid death in affected individuals.

AB  - Paleopathologists have begun exploring the pathoecology of parasitic diseases in relation to diet and environment. We are summarizing the parasitological findings from a mummy in the site of Lapa do Boquete, a Brazilian cave in the state of Minas Gerais. These findings in context of the archaeology of the site provided insights into the pathoecology of disease transmission in cave and rockshelter environments. We are presenting a description of the site followed by the evidence of hookworm, intestinal fluke, and Trypanosoma infection with resulting Chagas disease in the mummy discovered in the cave. These findings are used to reconstruct the transmission ecology of the site.

LA  - English
KW  - HEMIPTERA REDUVIIDAE
KW  - BRAZIL
AB  - The rupestrian Triatoma costalimai species has been found infected by Trypanosoma cruzi in wild, peridomicile, and intradomicile environments in the municipality of Aurora do Tocantins, Tocantins, Brazil. Proximity between rock outcrops increases the risk of vector transmission of Chagas disease via this species. This work describes a focus of colonization by T. costalimai specimens infected by T. cruzi in rock outcrops located in an urban area in this municipality. Parasitological examination of feces from the collected specimens, axenic cultivation of T. cruzi-positive samples, and genetic characterization of the isolates were performed. Nymph and adult specimens were collected with a high infection prevalence (64.5%) for T. cruzi discrete type unit (DTU I). Participation of the T. costalimai species in the wild cycle of T. cruzi in rock outcrops located in an urban area demonstrates the need for entomological surveillance and control of vector transmission of Chagas disease in the municipality of Aurora do Tocantins, Tocantins.

AB  - Background: Trypanosoma cruzi is classified into six discrete taxonomic units (DTUs). For this classification, different biological markers and classification criteria have been used. The objective was to identify the genetic profile of T. cruzi samples isolated from patients of two municipalities of Jequitinhonha Valley, MG, Brazil.
   Methods: Molecular characterization was performed using two different criteria for T. cruzi typing to characterize 63 T. cruzi samples isolated from chronic Chagas disease patients. The characterizations followed two distinct methodologies. Additionally, the RAPD technique was used to evaluate the existence of genetic intragroup variability.
   Results: The first methodology identified 89 % of the samples as TcII, but it was not possible to define the genetic identity of seven isolates. The results obtained with the second methodology corroborated the classification as TcII of the same samples and defined the classification of the other seven as TcVI. RAPD analysis showed lower intra-group variability in TcII.
   Conclusions: The results confirmed the preliminary data obtained in other municipalities of the Jequitinhonha Valley, showing a predominance of TcII, similar to that verified in northeast/south axis of Brazil and the first detection of TcVI in the study region. The second protocol was more simple and reliable to identify samples of hybrid character.

AB  - The diagnosis of Chagas disease is based on the detection of Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi)-specific antibodies. Nonetheless, there is concern about the sensitivity of current serological assays due to reports of T. cruzi PCR positivity among seronegative individuals. The aim of this study was to evaluate if T. cruzi seronegative infections occur in endemic areas. We recruited 2,157 individuals that were identified as having Chagas disease in a public health system database of an endemic region in Brazil. All participants were interviewed and 2,091 had a sample collected for serological and PCR testing. From these, 149 (7.1%) had negative serological results. PCR was positive in 610 samples (31.4%) of the 1,942 seropositive samples but in none of the 149 samples from seronegative participants. True T. cruzi seronegative infections seem to be rare (95% CI 0-3.7) and should not be a concern for blood supply, which relies on antibody screening.

AB  - To assess patterns of Chagas disease, we reviewed results of screening umbilical cord blood from a US public cord blood bank during 2007-2014. Nineteen maternal donors tested positive for Trypanosoma cruzi parasites (0.04%). Because perinatal transmission of Chagas disease is associated with substantial illness, targeted prenatal programs should screen for this disease.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi, has a wide distribution in South America, and its main method of control is the elimination of triatomines. It is presented here the geographic distribution and the rate of natural infection by T. cruzi of triatomines collected and evaluated from 2008 to 2013 in southwest of Bahia. Triatomines were captured in the intradomiciliary and peridomiciliary areas of five cities located in the southwest of Bahia state, identified, and analyzed for the presence of trypanosomatids in their feces. During the study period the number of patients suspected for acute Chagas disease was recovered from the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN). 8966 triatomines were captured and identified as belonging to eight species. Twenty-six presented themselves infected, being Triatoma sordida the most abundant and with the highest percentage of infection by T. cruzi. Tremedal was the city with the highest number of cases of acute Chagas' disease reported to SINAN. All cities showed triatomines infected with T. cruzi, so there is considerable risk of vectorial transmission of Chagas disease in the southwestern Bahia state, evidencing the need for vector transmission control programs and preventive surveillance measures.

CD data in Brazil are scarce; a retrospective analysis of the clinical characteristics of 80 patients treated at the Clinical Hospital of UNICAMP, Campinas, Brazil, was performed. Methods: Patient data records were analyzed. Results: Thirty percent of the patients probably got infected through vector-borne transmission, 65% came from endemic areas, a predominance of cardiac and cardiodigestive forms was found among males, and the cardiac form prevailed (51%). Conclusions: The results update the view on the epidemiology of CD in Campinas, Brazil.

AB  - Introduction: Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of Chagas disease in humans, mainly in Latin America. Trypanosome stocks were isolated by hemoculture from patients followed at Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (FIOCRUZ) and studied using different approaches. Methods: For species and genotype identification, the stocks were analyzed by parasitological techniques, polymerase chain reaction assays targeted to specific DNA sequences, isoenzyme patterns, besides sequencing of a polymorphic locus of TcSC5D gene (one stock). Results: The isolates presented typical T. cruzi morphology and usually grew well in routine culture media. Metacyclic trypomastigotes were found in cultures or experimentally infected Triatoma infestans. All isolates were pure T. cruzi cultures, presenting typical 330-bp products from kinetoplast DNA minicircles, and 250 or 200-bp amplicons from the mini-exon non-transcribed spacer. Their genetic type assignment was resolved by their isoenzyme profiles. The finding of TcI in one asymptomatic patient from Paraiba was confirmed by the sequencing assay. TcVI was found in two asymptomatic individuals from Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul. TcII was identified in six patients from Pernambuco, Bahia and Minas Gerais, who presented different clinical forms: cardiac (2), digestive with megaesophagus (1), and indeterminate (3). Conclusions: The main T. cruzi genotypes found in Brazilian chronic patients were identified in this work, including TcI, which is less frequent and usually causes asymptomatic disease, unlike that in other American countries. This study emphasizes the importance of T. cruzi genotyping for possible correlations between the parasite and patient' responses to therapeutic treatment or disease clinical manifestations.

AB  - Background: In northeastern Brazil, the wild nature of Trypanosoma cruzi vectors has challenged control actions. This study aims to describe the entomological and epidemiological scenario of Chagas disease in rural communities in the state of Piaui.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study (n=683 individuals/244 dwellings) was carried out to obtain serum samples, sociodemographic data and intra- and peridomestic triatomines.
   Results: The overall seroprevalence rate was 8.1%, with no positive tests among subjects <30 y of age. Prevalence rates reached 34.3% and 39.1% among subjects 61-75 and >75 y of age, respectively; 1474 triatomines were collected, of which 90.3% were found in peridomiclliary structures and 9.7% inside houses; 87.2% were classified as Triatoma brasiliensis. T. cruzi infection rates in insects were 0.5% by Eight microscopy and 0.9% by culture in NNN/LIT medium. Five cultivated isolates were submitted to molecular genotyping, three of which were identified as T. cruzi I and two as T. cruzi II.
   Conclusions: Although no vector transmission currently occurs, prevalence rates are high in adults and the elderly. This disease should be targeted by primary healthcare providers. Insect surveillance and control activities should not be discontinued in an environment favourable to the perpetuation of house colonization by triatomines.

AB  - Introduction: American tripanosomiasis (Chagas disease), the second most neglected disease in the world, is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Though natural transmission by insect vectors has been controlled, there is significant risk of T. cruzi transmission by blood transfusion in non-endemic regions, generally due to immigration processes from endemic areas.
   Methodology: The objective of this study was to evaluate anti-T. cruzi seroprevalence in blood donors from the western part of Sao Paulo State, Brazil, by serologic and immunofluorescence confirmation tests for the period between 2012 and 2014. Currently, this region is regarded as a non-endemic area for Chagas disease.
   Results: The confirmed overall T. cruzi seroprevalence among blood donors was 0.10%, which can be considered low compared to other Brazilian regions. Nevertheless, the distribution of the anti-T. cruzi antibodies within the examined region was uneven, and some areas of significantly higher prevalence were observed.
   Conclusions: We could consider two tendencies in the prevalence of T. cruzi: (i) residual older undiagnosed cases from Sao Paulo State, and (ii) immigration from endemic Brazilian or South American regions. The discordance obtained for T. cruzi prevalence by serologic and immunofluorescence methods demonstrates that more specific routine diagnosis is needed to diminish the cost of the assays and the loss of blood supply once all seropositive blood bags are immediately discarded.

AB  - Background Trypanosoma cruzi/HIV coinfection has been described as a relevant clinical event and an emerging public health problem. Here, we describe the epidemiological patterns of deaths related to Chagas disease and HIV/AIDS coinfection in Brazil from 2000 to 2019. Methods We performed a nationwide population-based study using mortality data obtained from the Brazilian Mortality Information System. We included all deaths recorded in Brazil from 2000 to 2019 in which Chagas disease and HIV/AIDS were mentioned on the same death certificate, either as underlying or as associated causes of death. Results Chagas disease and HIV/AIDS were mentioned on 196/22 663 092 death certificates. HIV/AIDS was the underlying cause in 58.2% (114/196) of deaths and Chagas disease in 33.2% (65/196). The average annual mortality rate was 0.05 deaths/1 000 000 inhabitants (95% CI 0.03 to 0.09). The highest death rates were found among males, those aged 60-69 y, Afro-Brazilians, those with 1-3 y of schooling/study and residents in Chagas disease-endemic regions/states. Respiratory, infectious/parasitic and cardiovascular diseases/disorders were the associated causes of death most commonly mentioned. Conclusions Mortality due to Chagas disease and HIV/AIDS coinfection may be largely underestimated in Brazil. Our data further reinforce the importance of screening for T. cruzi infection in HIV-infected patients from Chagas disease-endemic areas. Appropriate clinical management should be ensured for Chagas disease and HIV coinfected patients.

AB  - A new epidemiological view of American trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease has been formulated in recent decades. Oral transmission of the etiological agent of Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, has been the most common form of transmission. The T. cruzi discrete typing units TcI and TcIV have been involved in tens outbreaks of acute cases of Chagas disease in the Brazilian Amazon region. We investigated the intensity of infection in mice that were orally inoculated (OR group) with four strains of TcIV that were isolated from two outbreaks of acute Chagas disease that was orally acquired in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. We compared the OR group with mice that were intraperitoneally inoculated (IP group). Blood samples were analyzed by fresh blood examination, hemoculture, and conventional and qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Samples of different tissues were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The OR group exhibited a higher maximum peak of parasitemia, greater rates of positivity, and higher parasite loads in different tissues during acute infection compared with the IP group, indicating a greater intensity of orally acquired infection. Mice that were orally inoculated with TcIV strains that were obtained from two outbreaks of orally acquired Chagas disease in Amazonas, Brazil, exhibited a more intense course of infection compared with intraperitoneally inoculated mice, reflected by higher levels of parasitemia and parasite loads.

AB  - Despite public health campaigns and epidemiological surveillance activities, Chagas disease remains a major health problem in Latin America. According to data from the World Health Organization, there are approximately 7-8 million people infected with Trypanosoma cruzi worldwide, a large percentage of which in Latin America. This study aims to examine the serological profile of blood donors in blood banks of Hemominas hematology center, in the town of Ituiutaba, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The study sample consisted of 53,941 blood donors, which were grouped according to gender and age. Sample collections were performed from January 1991 to December 2011, and 277 donors (0.5%) were considered serologically ineligible due to Chagas disease. Analysis of data showed no significant difference between genders. As for age, the highest proportion of ineligible donors was from 40 to 49 years (30%), and there was a positive correlation between increasing age and the percentage of patients seropositive for Chagas disease. Therefore, adopting strategies that allow the safe identification of donors with positive serology for Chagas disease is essential to reduce or eliminate indeterminate serological results.

AB  - Furnas do Dionoisio is a Brazilian Afro-descendant settlement in the city of Jaraguari, 21.4 miles from Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Approximately 96 families live in this quilombola (Maroon) settlement, also known in Brazil as a remnant community of descendants of African slaves. Recent studies found 20% of households were infested by triatomines, 18% of insects captured in the community were infected by Trypanosoma cruzi, and 22.7% of dogs presented T. cruzi antibodies. The low prevalence of Chagas disease observed in humans in Mato Grosso do Sul State is attributed to its arrival via colonist migration and subsequent transplacental transmission. In order to gain a better understanding of the T. cruzi cycle in residents of the study community, serological and molecular tests were carried out to diagnose Chagas disease. In the present study, 175 residents between 2 and 80 years old were included. A total of 175 participants were interviewed and 170 provided blood samples, which were tested for T. cruzi antibodies with serological tests. Molecular diagnosis was performed in 167 participants by PCR (KDNA) and NPCR (satellite DNA) tests. One of the 170 samples tested positive for all serological tests performed. The overall frequency of Chagas disease in the community was low (0.6%). Interview responses revealed that 66.3% knew of triatomine insects and 65.7% reported having had no contact with them. Physical improvements to residences, together with vector surveillance and control by the State and municipal governments and local ecological conservation contribute to the low frequency of the Chagas disease in this quilombola community.

AB  - A multi-epitope protein expressed in a prokaryotic system, including epitopes of Env, Gag, and Tax proteins of both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 was characterized for HTLV-1/2 serological screening. This tool can contribute to support the implementation of public policies to reduce HTLV-1/2 transmission in Brazil, the country with the highest absolute numbers of HTLV-1/2 infected individuals. The chimeric protein was tested in EIA using serum/plasma of HTLV-infected individuals and non-infected ones from four Brazilian states, including the North and Northeast regions (that present high prevalence of HTLV-1/2) and Southeast region (that presents intermediate prevalence rates) depicting different epidemiological context of HTLV-1/2 infection in our country. We enrolled samples from Para (n = 114), Maranhao (n = 153), Minas Gerais (n = 225) and Sao Paulo (n = 59) states; they are from blood donors' candidates (Para and Minas Gerais), pregnant women (Maranhao) and HIV+/high risk for sexually transmitted infection (STI; Sao Paulo). Among the HTLV-1/2 positive sera, there were co-infections with viral (HTLV-1 + HTLV-2, HIV, HCV, and HBV), bacterial (Treponema pallidum) and parasitic (Trypanosoma cruzi, Schistosma mansoni, Strongyloides stercoralis, Entamoeba coli, E. histolytica, and Endolimax nana) pathogens related to HTLV-1/2 co-morbidities that can contribute to inconclusive diagnostic results. Sera positive for HIV were included among the HTLV-1/2 negative samples. Considering both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2-infected samples from all states and different groups (blood donor candidates, pregnant women, and individuals with high risk for STI), mono or co-infected and HTLV-/HIV+, the test specificity ranged from 90.09 to 95.19% and the sensitivity from 82.41 to 92.36% with high accuracy (ROC AUC = 0.9552). This multi-epitope protein showed great potential to be used in serological screening of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 in different platforms, even taking into account the great regional variation and different profile of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 mono or co-infected individuals.

AB  - Chagas is a neglected disease endemic in Latin America. Vector transmission control had been aggressively performed. Recent entomological surveillance in Brazil has revealed natural infection rates ranging from 0.40% to 0.52%. Although serological surveys are complex to develop, they are important for disease control. In this study, we validated the use of saliva in ELISA commercial kits with a cohort of 100 patients with Chagas disease followed at Hospital das Clinicas in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and 50 healthy controls. Five ELISA kits for detecting antibodies against Trypanosome cruzi were tested. The best discrimination between Chagas patients and controls was observed with the Wiener kit, which yielded a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 100%. Our findings reveal that the use of saliva may be an alternative to large-scale screening surveys in detecting T. cruzi antibodies; it is a noninvasive sample collection method potentially key to large-scale screening in children.

AB  - Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient in the diet of mammals and has an important role in the immune function. Selenium is a key element in selenoproteins involved in the in the maintenance of the antioxidant defense. Diet with selenium is beneficial for the treatment of diseases correlated with high levels of oxidative stress, also observed in the Chagas disease. Chagas disease is a neglected disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and several research groups are focused on the illness treatment. Immunomodulation of the infection using microelements is an important tool to avoid deleterious effects of the Chagas disease. Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the effects of selenium supplementation on pregnant Wistar rats infected with T. cruzi. Selenium treatment stimulated the weight and length of fetuses and placentas allied to the decrease of blood parasitemia. However, selenium demonstrated a low influence on T cells, diminishing the B cell population (CD4511A(+)). Moreover, the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was downregulated under selenium administration. Low pro-inflammatory cytokines levels probably are related to the increase in the number of amastigote nests in infected and treated animals Thus, selenium supplementation during pregnancy could impair the local placental immune response. Further studies are necessary to assess the interaction between selenium and the acute Chagas' disease during pregnancy, which will base future supplementation strategies.

AB  - Proven cases of vector-transmitted acute autochthonous Chagas disease in the United States are rare (<10 cases). Possible or probable cases of unknown duration determined by serology are uncommon as well (<100). In Latin America it is widely accepted that after feeding, the kissing bug defecates and Trypanosoma cruzi in the feces is rubbed into the bite punctum. This is an inefficient method of parasite transmission. The average infected individual in Latin America suffers more than 1000 bites, but more importantly, there are often thousands of kissing bugs in a household dropping feces on the inhabitants and living quarters. Today in Brazil the most common form of acute Chagas is secondary to oral ingestion of the parasite in food and drink. We present our experience with many hundreds of individuals bitten by kissing bugs and the possibility of oral ingestion occurring in the United States (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Patients with Chagas disease (CD), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, present a higher risk of developing other chronic diseases, which may contribute to CD severity. Since CD is underreported in the southern state of Parana, Brazil, we aimed to characterize clinical and epidemiological aspects of individuals chronically infected with T. cruzi in Southern Brazil. Methods: A community hospital-based study was performed, recording clinical/demographic characteristics of 237 patients with CD from Southern Brazil. To estimate the association between different forms of CD and sociodemographic and clinical variables, multiple logistic regression models were built using the Akaike information criterion. Results: Mean age was 57.5 years and 59% were females. Most patients' (60%) place of origin/birth was within Parana and they were admitted to the CD outpatient clinic after presenting with cardiac/digestive symptoms (64%). The predominant form of CD was cardiac (53%). followed by indeterminate (36%), and digestive (11%). The main electrocardiographic changes were in the right bundle branch block (3 9%) and left anterior fascicular block (32%). The average number of comothidities per patient was 3.9 +/- 2.3; systemic arterial hypertension was most common (64%), followed by dyslipidemia (34%) and diabetes (19%); overlapping comothidities were counted separately. Male sex was associated with symptomatic cardiac CD (OR=2.92; 95%CI: 1.05-8.12; p=0.040). Conclusions: This study provided greater understanding of the distribution and clinical profile of CD patients in Southern Brazil, indicating a high prevalence of comorbidities among these patients who are a vulnerable group due to advanced age and substantial risk of morbidity.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease (CD). CD is a persistent, lifelong infection affecting many organs, most notably the heart, where it may result in acute myocarditis and chronic cardiomyopathy. The pathological features include myocardial inflammation and fibrosis. In the Brazil strain-infected CD-1 mouse, which recapitulates many of the features of human infection, we found increased plasma levels of resolvin D1 (RvD1), a specialized prore-solving mediator of inflammation, during both the acute and chronic phases of infection (> 100 days postinfection) as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Additionally, ELISA on lysates of trypomastigotes of both strains Tulahuen and Brazil revealed elevated levels of RvD1 compared with lysates of cultured epimastigotes of T. cruzi, tachyzoites of Toxoplasma gondii, trypomastigotes of Trypanosoma brucei, cultured L6E9 myoblasts, and culture medium containing no cells. Lysates of T. cruzi-infected myoblasts also displayed increased levels of RvD1. Lipid mediator metabolomics confirmed that the trypomastigotes of T. cruzi produced RvD1, RvD5, and RvE2, which have been demonstrated to modulate the host response to bacterial infections. Plasma RvD1 levels may be both host and parasite derived. Since T. cruzi synthesizes specialized proresolving mediators of inflammation, as well as proinflammatory eicosanoids, such as thromboxane A(2), one may speculate that by using these lipid mediators to modulate its microenvironment, the parasite is able to survive.

AB  - Background: Triatomines are responsible for the vector transmission of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease. Triatoma brasiliensis is the main vector of the parasite in Brazil, and dogs are an important reservoir of the parasite. The aim of this study was to evaluate the insecticidal effect of fluralaner (Bravecto (R)) on T. brasiliensis after a blood meal in treated dogs.
   Methods: Healthy mongrel dogs (n = 8) were recruited from the Zoonoses Control Center (ZCC) in the city of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, and randomized into two groups, a fluralaner (Bravecto (R))-treated group (n = 4) and a control group (n = 4). Colony-reared third-, fourth- and fifth-instar nymphs of T. brasiliensis nymphs (n = 10) were allowed to feed on dogs from both groups for 30-40 min, once monthly, for up to 12 months. Bug mortality was observed up to 5 days after each blood meal.
   Results: Mortality in triatomines which had a blood meal on fluralaner (Bravecto (R))-treated dogs was 100% for up to 7 months after treatment, with mortality decreasing to 66.4% after 8 months, 57% after 9 months, 35% after 10 months, 10% after 11 months and 0% after 12 months. The mortality of triatomines that fed on non-treated control dogs was always <= 2.5%.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that fluralaner (Bravecto (R)) treatment of dogs induces long-term mortality of T. brasiliensis after the blood meal. This is a potential approach to be used to control vector transmission of T. cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, especially in endemic areas.

AB  - Aims: This article aimed to provide a critical review of the evolution of Chagas' disease (ChD) in Brazil, its magnitude, historical development and management, and challenges for the future.
   Methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed, SciELO and Google Scholar and throughout collected articles' references. Narrative analysis was structured around five main themes identified: vector transmission, control programme, transfusion, oral and congenital transmission.
   Results: In Brazil, the Chagas' Disease Control Programme was fully implemented in the 1980s, when it reached practically all the endemic areas, and in 1991, the Southern Cone Initiative was created, aiming to control the disease transmission through eliminating the Triatoma infestans and controlling blood banks. As a result, the prevalence of chagasic donors in blood banks reduced from 4.4% in the 1980s to 0.2% in 2005. In 2006, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) certified the interruption of transmission of ChD through this vector in Brazil. However, there are still challenges, such as the domiciliation of new vector species, the need for medical care of the infected individuals, the prevention of alternative mechanisms of transmission, the loss of political concern regarding the disease and the weakening of the control programme.
   Conclusion: Despite the progress towards control, there are still many challenges ahead to maintain and expand such control and minimise the risk of re-emergence.

AB  - BackgroundChronic Chagas Disease (CD) diagnosis is based on serological methods employing crude, semipurified or recombinant antigens, which may result in low sensitivity or cross-reactivity. To reduce these restrictions, we developed a strategy involving use of molecules containing repetitive fragments of Trypanosoma cruzi conserved proteins. Diagnostic performance of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens (Molecular Biology Institute of Parana - IBMP in Portuguese acronym) was assessed to diagnose T. cruzi-infected and non-infected immigrants living in Barcelona (Spain), a non-endemic setting for Chagas disease.MethodsReactivity of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 was assessed using an in-house automated ELISA with 347 positive and 331 negative individuals to Chagas disease. Antigenic cross-reactivity was measured with sera samples from pregnant women with Toxoplasma gondii (n=98) and Zika virus (n=75) antibodies.ResultsThe area under the curve values was 1 and 0.99 for the IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 proteins, respectively, demonstrating excellent diagnostic accuracy. The reactivity index was higher for IBMP-8.1 than IBMP-8.4 in positive samples and no significant difference in reactivity index was observed in negative samples. Sensitivity ranged from 99.4% for IBMP-8.1 to 99.1% for IBMP-8.4 and was not statistically different. Specificity for IBMP-8.1 reached 100 and 99.7% for IBMP-8.4, both nearly 100% accurate. No antigenic cross-reactivity was observed and reactivity index was similar to that for negative Chagas disease individuals.ConclusionsOur results showed an outstanding performance of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens by ELISA and suggest both chimeric antigens could also be used for Chagas disease diagnosis in immigrants living in non-endemic settings.

AB  - Several bat species can be infected by trypanosomes, but there is not much information about which of these parasites infect bats from TriA cent ngulo Mineiro and Alto Paranaiba, Minas Gerais state, Brazil, a formerly endemic region for Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The aim of this study was to describe, characterize, and identify the presence of trypanosomes in bats. The captured bats (448) belong to four families and to 19 different species. Of those, 37 bats were found to be positive for trypanosomes by microhematocrit, (infection rate 8.3%) and 27 were positive after hemoculture analysis. Initially, the isolates were identified by PCR (18S rDNA, 24S alpha rDNA, spliced leader, COII RFLP-PCR) using primers originally designed for T. cruzi. PCRs (18S rDNA, 24S alpha rDNA) showed compatible bands for TcI, whereas COII RFLP-PCR showed a similar pattern associated to TcII. However, there was no DNA amplification using spliced leader as a target, revealing a discrepancy between the results. Phylogenetic analysis of Cathepsin L-like and 18S rDNA sequences proved that 15 of the isolates corresponded to Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei and one to Trypanosoma dionisii. These results revealed that the diversity of trypanosome species in a region considered endemic for Chagas disease is greater than previous descriptions. All this can confirm the necessity of using DNA sequencing approaches in order to determinate trypanosomes species isolated from bats.

AB  - Bats are ancient hosts of Trypanosoma species and their flying ability, longevity and adaptability to distinct environments indicate that they are efficient dispersers of parasites. Bats from Acre state (Amazon Biome) were collected in four expeditions conducted in an urban forest (Parque Zoobotanico) and one relatively more preserved area (Seringal Cahoeira) in Rio Branco and Xapuri municipalities. Trypanosoma sp. infection was detected by hemoculture and fresh blood examination. Isolated parasite species were identified by the similarity of the obtained DNA sequence from 18S rDNA polymerase chain reaction and reference strains. Overall, 367 bats from 23 genera and 32 species were examined. Chiropterofauna composition was specific to each municipality, although Artibeus sp. and Carollia sp. prevailed throughout. Trypanosoma sp. infection was detected in 85 bats (23-2%). The most widely distributed and prevalent genotypes were (in order) Trypanosoma cruzi TcI, T. cruzi marinkellei, Trypanosoma dionisii, T. cruzi TcIV and Trypanosoma rang& At least one still-undescribed Trypanosoma species was also detected in this study. The detection of T. cruzi TcI and TcIV (the ones associated with Chagas disease in Amazon biome) demonstrates the putative importance of these mammal hosts in the epidemiology of the disease in the Acre State.

AB  - Background: Several cases of food-borne acute Chagas disease (ACD) have been reported in the Brazilian Amazon so far. Up to 2004, the occurrence of ACD by oral transmission, associated with food consumption, was rare. Recent cases of ACD in Brazil have been attributed to the consumption of juice from the acai palm containing reservoir animals or insect vectors waste, infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. This study aimed to determine the T. cruzi contamination rate and to genotype the parasite in food samples prepared from acai, which are commercialized in Rio de Janeiro and the Para States in Brazil.
   Methods: The amplificability of DNA extracted from acai samples, and T. cruzi and Triatominae detection were performed by conventional PCR. Molecular characterization was done by multilocus PCR analysis, to determine the parasite discrete type units (DTUs) based on the size of PCR products in agarose gels, using the intergenic region of the spliced leader (SL), 24 Sa rDNA and nuclear fragment A10 as targets.
   Results: From the 140 samples of acai-based products analyzed, T. cruzi DNA was detected in 14 samples (10%); triatomine DNA was detected in one of these 14 samples. The parasite genotyping demonstrated that food samples containing acai showed a mixture of T. cruzi DTUs with TcIII, TcV and TcI prevailing.
   Conclusions: In this study, the molecular detection and identification of T. cruzi from acai-based manufactured food samples, was performed for the first time. Although parasite DNA is a marker of possible contamination during food manufacturing, our findings do not indicate that acai is a source of Chagas disease via oral transmission per se, as live parasites were not investigated. Nevertheless, a molecular approach could be a powerful tool in the epidemiological investigation of outbreaks, supporting previous evidence that acai-based food can be contaminated with T. cruzi. Furthermore, both food quality control and assessment of good manufacturing practices involving acai-based products can be improved, assuring the safety of acai products.

AB  - Chagas Disease is a pathology caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. It is considered a public health issue, especially its congenital transmission, not only in endemic countries but also in non-endemic ones, being the main form of transmission in Chile. Objectives: To describe a congenital Chagas Disease case and to report about the usefulness of prenatal screening for Chagas Disease. Clinical Case: A 29-week preterm newborn of a multiparous mother with Chagas Disease detected in the perinatal screening of current pregnancy. Due to history of Trypanosoma cruzi, PCR was performed on the 4th day of life resulting undetectable. At the 6th and the 8th week of life, a macular erythematous rash and fever and respiratory distress were observed, respectively, both self-limited. At the 8th week of life, as a routine prematurity follow-up, a fundus examination was performed which showed bilateral retinal granulation, therefore, a TORCH study was performed with a negative result. Also, in this same week, a second Trypanosoma cruzi PCR was performed, with a positive result. Lab tests reported visualization of trypomastigotes, confirming the Congenital Chagas Disease diagnosis. The patient was treated with Nifurtimox, presenting an adverse reaction at 35 days of treatment with neutropenia, vomiting, and poor weight gain. The treating drug was replaced by Benznidazole, achieving 60 days of treatment. At 22 months of chronologic age, the patient has remained asymptomatic. Conclusions: It is necessary to increase efforts in prevention, early detection, and study of direct relatives. This report is an example of the usefulness of Chagas disease prenatal screening for the detection and early treatment of new cases.

AB  - Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease transmitted by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi that lately has been highlighted because several outbreaks attributed to oral transmission of the parasite have occurred. These outbreaks are characterized by high mortality rates and massive infections that cannot be related to other types of transmission such as the vectorial route. Oral transmission of Chagas disease has been reported in Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Argentina and French Guiana, most of them are massive oral outbreaks caused by the ingestion of beverages and food contaminated with triatomine feces or parasites' reservoirs secretions and considered since 2012 as a foodborne disease. In this review, we present the current status and all available data regarding oral transmission of Chagas disease, highlighting its relevance as a veterinary and medical foodborne zoonosis.

AB  - A total of 2,431 Triatoma brasiliensis were collected from 39 populations of Paraiba (PB) and Rio Grande do Norte (RN) states, Brazil. In PB, Trypanosoma cruzi infection was not detected in either peridomestic or domestic vector populations. In contrast, in RN, T. brasiliensis was detected with high parasite prevalence in these ecotopes (30.7-40.0%). Moreover, peridomicile insect population densities were more than double the average densities of all other settings evaluated (19.17 versus < 8.94 triatomine/man-hour). Genotyped parasites evidenced a mix of T. cruzi lineages circulating in both peridomestic and sylvatic populations. Although vector control efforts have dramatically decreased Chagas disease transmission to humans, recent outbreaks have been detected in four municipalities of RN state. Our results clearly evidence a worrisome proximity between infected vectors and humans in RN. Indeed, finding of infected T. brasiliensis inside homes is routinely recorded by local vector control surveillance staff around the outbreak area, challenging the current and conventional view that vector transmissions are controlled in northeastern Brazil. This scenario calls for strengthening vector control surveillance and interventions to prevent further Chagas transmission, especially in RN State.

AB  - Introduction: The transmission of Chagas disease (CD) through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and oral transmission has gained greater visibility as a result of intensified vector control activities in endemic regions and to control CD in non-endemic regions. In Brazil, Ceara is one of the states that perform the most organ transplants. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in organ donor candidates. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on data from potential organ donors at the Center of Transplantation of the State of Ceara from 2010 - 2015. Results: Data from a total of 2,822 potential donors were obtained, of which 1,038 were effective donors and 1,784 were excluded, likely due to lack of family authorization or medical contraindication. The prevalence of T. cruzi infection among these potential donors was 1.3% (n = 29). The majority of infected donors were males aged 41 - 60 years, residing in the interior of the state. Interestingly, 72.4% (n = 21) had positive or inconclusive serology for additional infections, such as cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B and C, and toxoplasmosis. Probability analysis revealed that stroke was the most common cause of death among potential donors with CD. Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of CD and other coinfections among potential solid organ donors in Ceara, and statistical tests have shown that these individuals are at increased risk of stroke when compared to potential non-reactive donors. This work highlights the importance of screening DC infection in potential donors.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are widely distributed throughout the world. Human parasitic infections are ubiquitous. Tropical parasites are increasingly recognized as causes of cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we address the most frequently reported parasites that directly infect the myocardium, including Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoal causative agent of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease), and Taenia solium, the cestode causative agent of taeniasis and cysticercosis. We also discuss tropical endomyocardial fibrosis, trichinellosis and schistosomiasis. Health systems, attitudes, the perceptions of both patients and physicians as well as socioeconomic factors should all be explored and recognized as crucial factors for improving the control of cardiovascular diseases in the tropics. Clinicians throughout the world must remain aware of imported parasites as potential causes of cardiac diseases.

AB  - Sequence diversity in the Trypanosoma cruzi small surface molecule TSSA has yielded antigens for serology to investigate the T. cruzi lineage-specific infection history of patients with Chagas disease. Synthetic peptides can be used as the lineage-specific antigens. Here we consider the rationale, feasibility and potential of applying peptide-based lineage-specific serology to naturally infected wild mammals. The commercial availability of appropriate secondary antibodies encourages this further development, for discovery of new reservoir host species and to reveal the wider ecological distribution of T. cruzi lineages, currently hindered by the need to recover live isolates or to attempt genotyping of DNA extracted from blood samples.

AB  - Chagas disease, which is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is transmitted primarily by triatomine bugs, although the incidence of new cases has decreased as a result of vector control. In Brazil, most of those affected have the chronic form of the disease and are generally elderly individuals who require appropriate clinical follow-up. In this work, we undertook a descriptive study in which 85 patients were interviewed and blood samples were collected for molecular analyses based on the amplification of parasite satellite DNA. The cardiac form of the disease was the most prevalent among the patients and hypertension was the most frequent comorbidity; polypharmacy was detected in 34% of the cases. Serological tests were positive in 95% of cases while 36% were positive in nested-polymerase chain reaction. These findings indicate an increased use of medications and a larger number of age-related diseases in elderly patients with Chagas disease, even in patients with low parasitemia. We conclude that elderly patients with Chagas disease require special attention and that further studies should be done with elderly individuals who carry this disease.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite endemic to Latin America. Most infections occur in children by vector or congenital transmission. Trypanosoma cruzi establishes a complexity of specific molecular parasite-host cell interactions to invade the host However, most studies have been mainly focused on the interaction between the parasite and different cell types, but not on the infection and invasion on a tissue level. During congenital transmission, T cruzi must cross the placental barrier, composed of epithelial and connective tissues, in order to infect the developing fetus. Here we aimed to study the global changes of transcriptome in the placental tissue after a T. cruzi challenge.
   Results: Strong changes in gene expression profiling were found in the different experimental conditions, involving the reprogramming of gene expression in genes involved in the innate immune response.
   Conclusions: Trypanosoma cruzi induces strong changes in genes involved in a wide range of pathways, especially those involved in immune response against infections.

AB  - Introduction: Natural and artificial ecotope infestation by the kissing bug triatomines and their colonization and infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, the Chagas disease agent, were evaluated in nine municipalities of the State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Methods: Following identification, triatomine intestinal contents were analyzed by direct microscopic examination, xenoculture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for parasite detection. Trypanosoma cruzi isolates were genotyped using three different markers. Results: Of 842 triatomines captured, 65% were Triatoma brasiliensis, 17.8% Triatoma pseudomaculata, 12.5% Panstrongylus lutzi, and 4.7% Rhodnius nasutus. Triatoma brasiliensis and P. lutzi adults were found in the intradomicile. T. brasiliensis, T. pseudomaculata, and R. nasutus nymphs and adults were found in the peridomicile and wild environment. Intradomiciliary and peridomiciliary infestation indexes were 5.6% and 33.7%, respectively. In the peridomicile, chicken coops were the most infested ecotope. The T. cruzi triatomine infection rate was 30.2%, of which PCR detected 29%. P. lutzi (78.1%), T. brasiliensis (24.5%), and T. pseudomaculata (22.7%) were the most infected species. TcII and III genotypes were detected in T. brasiliensis and TcIII in P. lutzi. Conclusions: T. brasiliensis was found in all environments and most ecotopes with high T. cruzi infection rates. High infection rates were also detected in T. pseudomaculata and P. lutzi, suggesting their role in the interchange between the wild and peridomestic transmission cycles. The combination of PCR, microscopic examination, and xenoculture contributed to improving T. cruzi infection evaluation in triatomine bugs. The TcII and TcIII genotypes were predominant in the study area.

AB  - The aim of this survey was to determine the seropositivity and risk factors for Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi in dogs in the State of Paraiba, Northeastern Brazil. A total of 1,043 dogs were tested, and the serological diagnoses of Chagas disease (CD) and canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) was performed by the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Animals that tested seropositive for both diseases (by IFAT) were further subjected to ELISA. Of the 1,043 dogs 81 (7.8%; 95% CI = 6.1-9.4%) tested seropositive for Leishmania spp., while 83 were seropositive for T. cruzi (7.9%; 95% CI = 6.3-9.6%). Simultaneous serological reactions were detected in 49 animals (4.6%; 95% CI= 3.6-6.2%). Semi-domiciled housing (OR = 2.044), free housing (OR = 4.151), and soil (OR = 3.425) and soil/cement (OR=3.065) environmental conditions were identified as risk factors for CVL seropositivity. The risk factors identified for CD seropositivity were semi-domiciled (OR = 2.353) or free housing (OR = 3.454), and contact with bovine (OR = 2.015). This study revealed the presence of dogs in the Paraiba State seropositive for CVL and CD, suggesting the need for revisiting and intensification of disease control measures through constant monitoring of the canine population.

AB  - This is a review of more than 40 years of research on the epidemiological, socioeconomic and clinical aspects of Chagas disease in the Department of Uruguay (Entre Rios province). Research on the presence of triatomine vectors in urban and rural housing is summarized here. These vectors were identified and Trypanosoma cruzi was searched for.. The seroprevalence of the disease and its evolution over time were described. Cardiological and gastroenterological aspects of patients in the chronic period of the disease were also added. The presence of triatomines resulted in fumigation and health education campaigns, which caused a marked decrease in the number of vectors captured in the following years. The decrease in the seroprevalence of Chagas disease over time was also highlighted, due to fumigation campaigns, health education, blood bank and pregnant women controls, improvement of the techniques used and the development of effective treatments against the parasite. Cardiological and gastroenterological studies of chronic patients showed the abnormalities expected for this stage of the disease. The detection of infected persons with access to treatment and cardiological and gastroenterological studies performed in patients with chronic stage were also described. Finally, it is considered that, globally, the studies carried out in the area have helped to ensure that the Province of Entre Rios be declared free of the vector transmission in 2012.

AB  - Introduction: Approximately seven to eight million people worldwide have Chagas disease. In Brazil, benznidazole is the most commonly used active drug against Trypanosoma cruzi; however, its efficacy is limited, and side effects are frequent. Recent studies suggest that amiodarone may be beneficial in the treatment of this disease, by exerting anti-T. cruzi action. This study evaluated changes in T. cruzi cell count in in vitro cultures subjected to different doses of benznidazole, amiodarone, and their combination. Methods: T. cruzi (Y strain) cultures containing approximately 100,000 cells were treated with either 100mg, 50mg, 25mg, 12.5mg, or 10mg of benznidazole, amiodarone, or their combination. On the 4th day, cell count was compared to the baseline data. Results: On the 4th day, no parasites were observed in any of the treated cultures. Conclusions: Benznidazole and amiodarone were equally effective in eliminating T. cruzi in culture. The combination of the two drugs was also equally effective, but our data cannot demonstrate synergism, as similar results were obtained when the drugs were tested individually or in combination. It is suggested that this study be repeated with other T. cruzi strains to determine whether similar results can be obtained again.

She presented high parasitemia at the time of delivery; 3. In both, the mother and her daughter, T cruzi was classified as DTU TcIV. The parasites were not found in the blood at birth and the infection was detected only three months later in an asymptomatic infant. As the mother and her child live in a highly endemic area, vector transmission could not be excluded during this period.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is widely distributed in the Americas and is transmitted through vectorial, transfusional, and oral routes. This study aimed to evaluate the risk of vectorial transmission of Chagas disease in municipalities located in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil, by analyzing triatomine specimens collected from 2014 to 2020. All 1522 hematophagous triatomines were identified as Panstrongylus megistus, and were subjected to parasitological and molecular examinations. From 2014 to 2016, approximately 10% of insects were positive in the microscopic analysis of intestinal content, and 27% were positive as detected by the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of the same sampling. However, in the last investigated years, an increase in infected triatomines was observed in microscopic analysis (22%) and qPCR methods (41%). This corroborates the findings of acute human Chagas disease cases, which have increased in the study area from a maximum of 2 cases in previous years to 20 cases in 2019, and 17 cases in 2020 through June. Additionally, bloodmeal sources of infected triatomines were investigated; human blood was detected in up to 85.7% of the samples. Moreover, canine blood was also detected in triatomine intestinal content in recent years, reaching 91% of analyzed insects in 2018. Data on bloodmeal sources have demonstrated human-vector contact and have suggested the participation of dogs in the parasite transmission cycle. These results indicate the risk of T. cruzi vectorial transmission in Southern Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo owing to the boundary between these states. Thus, enhanced surveillance and vector control of Chagas disease are highly recommended in these areas.

AB  - Background: After decentralizing the actions of the Chagas Disease Control Program (CDCP) in Brazil, municipalities were now responsible for control measures against this endemic, supervised by the Regional Health Superintendencies (RHS). We aimed to evaluate the recent entomological surveillance of Chagas disease in the Regional Health Superintendence of Governador Valadares (RHS/GV) from 2014 to 2019.Methods: Triatomines captured by residents during entomological surveillance were sent to the reference laboratory, where the species and evolutionary stages were identified, place of capture, and presence of Trypanosoma cruzi. A database was created, and the following were calculated: the rate of infection by T. cruzi (overall rate and rate by species), monthly seasonality, spatial distribution of species, number of captures, and infected triatomines/health microregions.Results: We identified 1,708 insects; 1,506 (88.2%) were triatomines, most were adult instars (n=1,469), and few were nymphs (n=37). The identified species were Triatoma vitticeps, Panstrongylus megistus, Panstrongylus diasi, Rhodnius neglectus, and Panstrongylus geniculatus. The first three were most frequently captured and distributed throughout the study area. Most bugs were captured intradomicile (72.5%), mainly in the second semester, between September and November, with an average infection rate of 41.5% (predominantly T. vitticeps, 49.2%). All municipalities sent triatomines, especially in the microregions of Governador Valadares. Conclusions: These data reinforce the need and importance of improving Chagas disease control measures in the region to establish active and participatory entomological surveillance.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this research was to compare the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients with chronic Chagas disease with and without positive blood cultures for Trypanosoma cruzi.
   Methods: This was a retrospective longitudinal study that included 139 patients with chronic Chagas disease who underwent blood culture for T. cruzi. Blood cultures were performed using Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle medium enriched with Schneider's medium. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusting for age and sex was performed to identify if positive blood culture for T. cruzi was associated with all-cause mortality.
   Results: The blood culture positivity rate was 30.9%. Most patients were born in the Northeast and Southeast regions of Brazil. Patients with positive blood cultures were older (5213 vs 45 +/- 13 y; p=0.0009) and more frequently women (72.1% vs. 53.1%; p=0.03) than patients with negative blood cultures. The frequency of patients with cardiac or cardiodigestive forms was higher among patients with positive vs negative blood cultures (74.4% vs 54.1%; p=0.02). A total of 28 patients died during a mean follow-up time of 6.6 +/- 4.1 y. A positive blood culture was associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 2.26 [95% confidence interval 1.02 to 5.01], p=0.045).
   Conclusions: We found a higher proportion of patients with Chagas heart disease among patients with T. cruzi-positive blood cultures. A positive blood culture was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Therefore T. cruzi persistence may influence Chagas disease pathogenesis and prognosis.

AB  - The identification of bloodmeal sources in triatomine bugs (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) is important in understanding vector-host associations and in measuring the risk for Chagas' disease transmission. The bloodmeal sources of triatomines infected with Trypanosoma cruzi (Trypanosomatida: Trypanosomatidae) caught in houses in central Brazil (Goias State and the Federal District) were investigated during 2012-2014. Mitochondrial cytochrome b amplicons were used to identify bloodmeals through high-resolution melting and DNA sequencing. Most bugs were found to have fed on either humans (45.7%) or chickens (43.1%). Human blood was detected in Triatoma sordida (n = 22/50 bugs), Triatoma pseudomaculata (n = 7/11 bugs), Panstrongylus megistus (n = 10/24 bugs), Panstrongylus geniculatus (n = 1/3 bugs) and Rhodnius neglectus (n = 18/28 bugs) (all: Hemiptera: Reduviidae). Sequencing identified Necromys (Rodentia: Cricetidae) mouse blood in P. geniculatus and Tropidurus (Squamata: Tropiduridae) lizard blood in T. pseudomaculata and T. sordida. These findings reveal new vector-host associations. The present results suggest frequent contact between humans and T. cruzi-infected triatomines in central Brazil and indicate that Chagas' disease transmission by native vectors is an ongoing threat.

AB  - Background The identification of Trypanosoma cruzi and blood-meal sources in synanthropic triatomines is important to assess the potential risk of Chagas disease transmission. We identified T. cruzi infection and blood-meal sources of triatomines caught in and around houses in the state of Bahia, northeastern Brazil, and mapped the occurrence of infected triatomines that fed on humans and domestic animals. Methods Triatominae bugs were manually captured by trained agents from the Epidemiologic Surveillance team of Bahia State Health Service between 2013 and 2014. We applied conventional PCR to detect T. cruzi and blood-meal sources (dog, cat, human and bird) in a randomized sample of triatomines. We mapped triatomine distribution and analyzed vector hotspots with kernel density spatial analysis. Results In total, 5906 triatomines comprising 15 species were collected from 127 out of 417 municipalities in Bahia. The molecular analyses of 695 triatomines revealed a similar to 10% T. cruzi infection rate, which was highest in the T. brasiliensis species complex. Most bugs were found to have fed on birds (74.2%), and other blood-meal sources included dogs (6%), cats (0.6%) and humans (1%). Trypanosoma cruzi-infected triatomines that fed on humans were detected inside houses. Spatial analysis showed a wide distribution of T. cruzi-infected triatomines throughout Bahia; triatomines that fed on dogs, humans, and cats were observed mainly in the northeast region. Conclusions Synanthropic triatomines have a wide distribution and maintain the potential risk of T. cruzi transmission to humans and domestic animals in Bahia. Ten species were recorded inside houses, mainly Triatoma sordida, T. pseudomaculata, and the T. brasiliensis species complex. Molecular and spatial analysis are useful to reveal T. cruzi infection and blood-meal sources in synanthropic triatomines, identifying areas with ongoing threat for parasite transmission and improving entomological surveillance strategies.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi affects about 6-8 million people worldwide. Although transmission by triatomine insects has been controlled, other means of transmission maintain the infection. These forms of transmission are responsible for introducing Chagas disease in other non-endemic countries of the world. Thus, Chagas disease, nowadays is a worldwide health problem. In Brazil, acai pulp and sugarcane juice have been associated with Chagas disease outbreaks. The difficulties in isolation of the parasite from foods are hampering source tracking which could allow the confirmation of an implicated food commodity in these outbreak investigations. To address this scientific gap, we evaluated the performance of real-time PCR (qPCR) for detecting T. cruzi in acai pulp and sugarcane juice. All experiments were performed with acai pulp and sugarcane juice samples contaminated with different concentrations of T. cruzi. In assays with qPCR, the results showed that the ideal procedure for T. cruzi identification in acai pulp and sugarcane juice consisted of: i. centrifugation; ii. DNA extraction with a commercial kit for stool matrix; and iii. qPCR using a specific molecular marker for T. cruzi. The seeding in LIT medium of experimentally contaminated foods was effective in detecting the parasitic load by qPCR. The efficacy of qPCR was also verified testing food samples crushed with infected Triatomines. In conclusion, this methodology can be used to perform rapid diagnosis in outbreaks, facilitating measures in disease control.

AB  - Background Chagas disease or American trypanosomiasis is caused by the protozoanTrypanosoma cruziand is endemic of the Americas. The control of the disease is restricted to toxic and potentially teratogenic drugs, which limit the use during pregnancy. The use of food supplementation offers a safe and low-cost form to alleviate Chagas disease symptoms, mostly in areas with alimentary risk. For example, zinc demonstrates positive effects in immune response, including in Chagas disease during pregnancy. Purpose This study describes the innate response in pregnant rats chronically infected withT. cruziand supplemented with zinc. Methods Pregnant female Wistar rats, infected withT. cruzi, were treated with 20 mg/kg/day zinc sulfate and euthanized on the 18th day. Samples (plasma, splenocytes, and peritoneal exudate) were collected and several immune parameters (nitric oxide, RT1B, CD80/CD86, MCP-1, CD11b/c, NK/NKT, IL-2, IL-10, INF-cc, and apoptosis) evaluated. Results Under Zinc supplementation and/orT. cruziinfection, the gestation developed normally. Several innate immune parameters such as RT1B, CD80/CD86, MCP-1 expressing lymphocytes, IL-2, and IL-17 were positively altered, whereas nitric oxide, CD11b/c, NK/NKT, apoptosis, INF-gamma, and corticosterone demonstrated a pro-pregnancy pattern. Conclusion Our results indicated that zinc has diverse effects on immune response during pregnancy. An anti-T. cruziimmunity, as well as a pro-gestation response, were observed after zinc supplementation. The complete comprehension of zinc supplementation in pregnancy will base an adequate strategy to alleviate Chagas disease symptoms and propagation, especially for populations from endemic areas.

AB  - Introduction: Oral infection by Trypanosoma cruzi is currently the most important route of transmission of acute Chagas disease (ACD) in the North region of Brazil, and the reported outbreaks are usually related to ingestion of contaminated food, especially unprocessed acai pulp. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed to analyze the epidemiological profile of individuals with suspected cases of ACD in the municipality of Breves, located in the state of Path, Brazil. Therefore, notifications of suspected cases of ACD were collected from the Municipal Health Department of Breves from January 2007 to December 2017. Results: A total of 265 individuals were registered, and the majority were male (54.7%; 145/265). Age ranged from nine months to 79 years, with a greater number of notifications for individuals aged between 1 and 39 years (71.3%; 189/265). Most of them had a low level of education (74.3%. 197/265), were living in rural and urban areas (58.9%; 156/265 and 37.7%; 100/265, respectively). Infection occurred mainly in the domestic environment (%.2%; 255/265) through oral transmission (98.1%; 260/265). There were a greater number of notifications in November, December and January. Conclusions: These data showed that oral transmission of T. cruzi has become increasingly high in the study region, and health education programs need to be implemented as strategies to ensure good manufacturing practices of unprocessed food.

AB  - Chagas disease was investigated in two new settlements of landless rural workers inhabiting prefabricated, triatomine-proof houses and in four neighboring older communities where mud huts were still well suitable for vectors. Through a cross-sectional survey and entomological assessment, we surveyed 148 houses/families in the two new settlements and in 47 houses/families in the four older localities. We determined seroprevalence of Chagas disease through IFI and Elisa (eluates) assays and searched for vectors in the domestic and peridomestic environments. Seroprevalence reached 0.6 % (3/466) in the new settlements and 0.8 % (1/115) in the older communities. Triatomines were not found in the new settlements, while 7 Triatoma brasiliensis, 4 T. pseudomaculata, 1 Panstrongylus lutzi, and 145 Rhodnius nasutus were collected in the older localities. In addition, a colony of T. brasiliensis (n = 55) was encountered inside a school attended by children of the region. Parasite strains isolated from the insects were characterized as T. cruzi I. Despite the low prevalence of Chagas disease in both scenarios, entomological surveillance must be strengthened and housing improvement reinforced in order to control vector transmission. The risk of infection by the vectors was lower in the settlements of improved homes, where conditions for colonization of the peridomestic environment by transmitting insects were not observed.

AB  - Triatoma vitticeps is a triatomine with geographic distribution restrict to Brazil, which exhibits high prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi natural infection. Of special epidemiologic concern, this species often invades households in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo. The objective of this study was to evaluate morphological and ultrastructural parameters on three T. cruzi isolates obtained from wild T. vitticeps specimens. The growth and cell differentiation of the parasite was evaluated through epimastigote and trypomastigote forms obtained in the growth curves for three distinct isolates. The maximum growth showed differences at the 20th day of the curve. Our in vitro results show a heterogeneity, regarding these features for samples cultivated under the same conditions. Morphometric analyzes based on the shape of epimastigotes and trypomastigotes corroborated such differentiation. These results highlight the need of better understanding the meaning of this diversity under an eco-epidemiological perspective.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas disease is a major public health problem that is endemic in Brazil and Latin America. This study aimed to determine the socioeconomic. demographic, and clinical characteristics of 171 patients (mean age, 45 years; female, 65%) with Chagas disease at Hospital Universitario de Brasilia, Federal District, Brazil. Methods: We implemented this cross-sectional study using a clinical epidemiological questionnaire, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and quantitative detection of Trypanosoma cruzi DNA in blood using qRT-PCR. Results: Among the patients, 26.3% had a full elementary education, and 13.2% were illiterate. Most (63.6%) were economically classified as class C, and 51.5% were born in Bahia state. A total of 62.0% participants reported previous contact with the triatomine bug. The clinical forms of the disease were indeterminate (69.51%), cardiac (15.24%), digestive (10.37%), and mixed (4.88%). The most common electrocardiographic abnormality was complete right bundle branch block in association with a divisional anterosuperior block. Only 14.6% of the patients complied with benznidazole medication for at least 60 days, and 164 of them were assessed by echocardiography. The parasite load was positive in 56% of the patients. Conclusions: Chagas disease affected mostly women, with the indeterminate chronic form of the disease.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas disease (CD) affects 5.7-7.0 million individuals worldwide, and its prevalence reached 25.1% in the state of Bahia, Brazil. There is an association between the prevalence of CD, the socioeconomic status of the population, and the risk of re-emergence due to non-vectorial transmission, such as blood transfusion. This study determined the seroprevalence of T cruzi infection among blood donors in the state of Bahia, located in northeastern Brazil, and their epidemiological profile during a 10-year period. Methods: We performed a descriptive cross-sectional study involving a database review. Data were collected from patients with non-negative results for T cruzi infection during a 10-year period. Results: A total of 3,084 (0.62%) samples were non-negative for T cruzi infection in an initial serological screening, and 810 (0.16%) samples were non-negative in the second screening. The correlation between infection and age (30 years or older) and between infection and lower educational level (12 years or less) in the first and second screening was statistically significant The seroprevalence of T. cruzi infection was higher in men in the first screening. In addition, 99.52% of the municipalities of Bahia had at least one case of CD. Livramento de Nossa Senhora and Salvador presented the highest disease prevalence and recurrence, respectively. Conclusions: The seroprevalence of T cruzi infection in these populations was lower than that found in other studies in Brazil but was comparatively higher in densely-populated areas. The demographic characteristics of our population agreed with previous studies.

AB  - Background: Triatomines in Latin America are natural Chagas disease (ChD) vectors. Triatomine domiciliation is one of the main factors increasing the occurrence risk of this disease in humans. There are 66 triatomine species in Brazil, with three genera of significant epidemiological importance-Panstrongylus, Rhodnius, and Triatoma. Among the Triatoma species, Triatoma williami, a wild species, has been reported in Goias, Mato Grosso, and Mato Grosso do Sul. In the Barra do Garcas, Mato Grosso, the invasion by triatomines has been reported, with T. williami being the most common species. This study aimed to survey triatomine fauna and determine the Trypanosoma cruzi natural infection rates in triatomines in the urban area of Barra do Garcas, Mato Grosso, Brazil.
   Methods: Triatomine specimens were sampled by passive surveillance or active search by agents combating endemic diseases from 2019 to 2020. A parasitological feces diagnosis was performed to detect the presence of T. cruzi after the specimens were identified. Concerning T. cruzi identification, molecular diagnosis and genetic sequencing were performed to determine the strain, also called discrete typing units (DTUs).
   Results: The 211 triatomines were collected, distributed in specimens of T. williami (84.4%), P geniculatus (3.3%), P. diasi (1.4%), and R. neglectus (10.9%). Two colonies of T. williami were found through morphological analyses.These insects were sampled inside domiciles in an urban area neighboring Jardim Pitaluga (15 degrees 51'57.7 '' N, 052 degrees 16' 04.5 E). The records were sampled in September 2019 and January 2021. The rate of natural infection by T. cruzi was 39.4%. Two T. williami specimens from the sampled colonies were positive for the T. cruzi strain DTU IV.
   Conclusions: This is the first time that T. williami has been confirmed in an urban area of Barra do Garcas, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Further studies are needed for a clearer understanding of the ecology of this species for prevention and control mechanisms since its sampled specimens had a high rate of natural infection by T. cruzi.

AB  - The parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida, Trypanosomatidae) can be classified based on biochemical and molecular markers, into six lineages or discrete typing units (DTUs), T. cruzi I-VI (TcI-VI), from which TcI and TcII are the parental genotypes. Trying to understand the dispersion of the subpopulations of T. cruzi in nature and its complex transmission cycles, the serine carboxypeptidase genes of T. cruzi were used as a molecular marker in the present study. DTUs of 25 T. cruzi isolates derived from different hosts and from different regions of Brazil were classified. Using specific primers, the complete serine carboxypeptidase open reading frame of 1401 bp was sequenced. The obtained data shows significant differences in the sequences of TcI and TcII. The analysis of the T. cruzi significantly different serine carboxypeptidase genes allowed distinguishing between the parental DTUs TcI to TcII and the hybrid DTU TcVI which grouped within the latter branch. The sequence diversity within the T. cruzi subpopulations was rather low. The analysis using the genes encoding proteases seems to be an interesting approach for the reconstruction of the origin and genotype evolution of T. cruzi.

AB  - The north of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais is classified as an area of high risk of vectorial transmission of Chagas disease (CD) or of reestablishing transmission in the home, but the Chagas disease control programme is disjointed. The study evaluated the occurrence, natural infection and the spatial distribution of species of triatomines associated with climatic variations in the urban area of Montes Claros, a municipality endemic to CD in the north of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Triatomine data were obtained from passive entomological surveillance actions of the Chagas Disease Control Program (Programa de Controle de Doenca de Chagas-PCDCh), registered by the Zoonosis Control Center (Centro de Controle de Zoonoses-CCZ) from 2009 to 2019. A total of 277 triatomines belonging to eight species were collected, and of these, 203 insects were examined. It was found that 46.2% of triatomines were captured inside the home and 8.3% around the home. The natural infection rate was 6.9%; 14 specimens showed natural infection by Trypanosoma cruzi (12 females and 2 males), and of these, 13 were found in the home and one in an uninformed location. The number of triatomine records collected was significantly higher in the month of September (p = .01), and there was an inverse correlation between the number of triatomines and the relative humidity of the air (p < .001). It was verified that the highest triatomine densities are located in transition areas between urban infrastructure (32.12%) and pasture (25.72%). The diversity of species of triatomines infected with T. cruzi in residential units in urban areas in the municipality of Montes Claros is worrying, as it suggests a potential risk of transmission of the parasite to domestic animals and humans.

AB  - The aim of this review was to identify anti-inflammatory and antioxidant therapeutic agents and their effects on patients with chagasic myocarditis. A systematic review of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, WEB OF SCIENCE, SCOPUS, LILACS and CENTRAL databases (Cochrane Library) was carried out without language restrictions. The descriptors used were: 'Chagas cardiomyopathy', 'treatment', 'Chagas disease', 'anti-inflammatory agents', 'Trypanosoma cruzi' and 'antioxidants'. A total of 4,138 articles was identified, six of which were selected for data extraction. Of these, four were related to antioxidant therapy with vitamins C and E supplementation, and two using anti-inflammatory therapy. The studies were carried out in Brazil and were published between 2002 and 2017. Antioxidant therapy with vitamin C and E supplementation increases the activity of antioxidant enzymes and reduces the oxidative markers. There is no conclusive data to support the use of vitamin supplementation and anti-inflammatory therapy in the treatment of chagasic cardiomyopathy. However, the studies indicate the possibility of vitamin supplementation as a new approach to the treatment of Chagas disease. Antioxidant therapy was proven to be a viable alternative for attenuating the oxidative damage caused by chronic chagasic cardiopathy, leading to a better prognosis for patients.

AB  - Over the past two decades, several countries in Latin American, particularly Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia, have experienced multiple outbreaks of oral Chagas disease. Transmission occurs secondary to contamination of food or beverages by triatomine (kissing bug) feces containing infective Trypanosoma cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes. Orally transmitted infections are acute and potentially fatal. Oral Chagas transmission carries important clinical implications from management to public health policies compared to vector-borne transmission. This review aims to discuss the contemporary situation of orally acquired Chagas disease, and its eco-epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical management. We also propose preventive public health interventions to reduce the burden of disease and provide important perspectives for travel medicine. Travel health advisors need to counsel intending travellers to South America on avoidance of "deadly feasts" - risky beverages such as fruit juices including guava juice, bacaba, babacu and palm wine (vino de palma), acai pulp, sugar cane juice and foodstuffs such as wild animal meats that may be contaminated with T. cruzi.

AB  - This note reports on occurrences of triatomine species in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, registered between 1988 and 2017. Records of triatomines captured in Sao Paulo are based on specimens received spontaneously from Health Surveillance Centers, Health Centers and Zoonosis Control Centers in the city as well as from citizens. Species were identified morphologically at the Public Health Entomology Laboratory, Faculty of Public Health, University of Sao Paulo, where the triatomines, which are vectors of Chagas disease, were tested for Trypanosoma cruzi infection. The first reported occurrence of triatomine bugs in urban Sao Paulo was in 1988. The specimen, which was captured in Jardim Sao Luiz district, was from the genus Panstrongylus and was registered as Panstrongylus sp. but was not sexed. Since this first recorded occurrence, the following species have been found in the city: Panstrongylus geniculatus (2 occurrences), P. megistus (15 occurrences), Triatoma infestans (1 occurrence) and T. sordida (3 occurrences). In this paper, the importance of reporting occurrences of triatomine bugs in the city of Sao Paulo, one of the largest metropolis in the world, is discussed with an emphasis on P. megistus. The occurrences discussed here indicate the importance of entomological surveillance for these vectors even in urban centers although the possibility of vector transmission of Chagas disease in these centers is very low.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with Leishmania spp. and Trl.panosoma cruzi infections in dogs presented at veterinary clinics in the city of JoAo Pessoa, Paraiba state, northeastern Brazil. A total of 384 dogs from 34 veterinary clinics were sampled between April 2015 and May 2016. For serological diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, the indirect fluorescent antibody test was used. Reactive sera were submitted to a confirmatory test using the S7 ELISA. The seroprevalence of Leishmania spp. was 2.8% (11/384), and that of T. cruzi was 1.5% (6/384). Two animals were positive for both parasites. The variable "access to the street" was identified as a risk factor for Leishmania spp. infection (OR = 4.81; 95% CI = 1.23-18.75). We concluded that a significant proportion of dogs presented at veterinary clinics in Joao Pessoa are seropositive for Leishmania spp. or T cruzi infections, and we suggest that greater care be taken with dogs that have access to the street.

AB  - Chagas disease is caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi. Its main reservoir is the domestic dog, especially in rural areas with favorable characteristics for vector establishment and proliferation. The aims of this study were to collect data. survey and map the fauna, and identify T cruzi infection in triatomines, as well as to assess the presence of anti-T cruzi antibodies in dogs in rural areas of the municipality of Mossoro, Brazil. Methods: An active entomologic research was conducted to identify adult specimens through an external morphology dichotomous key. The analysis of natural infection by T cruzi in the insects was performed by isolation in culture and polymerase chain reaction. The antibody testing for T cruzi in dogs was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence assay. Results: A total of 68 triatomines were captured, predominantly the Mama brasiliensis bras ilien.sis (Neiva 1911) species. The vector mapping displayed areas with greater risk for parasite transmission. Of the examined triatomines (51 specimens), 41.2% (21/51) were positive on polymerase chain reaction, and all were negative on culture. In the serum testing, 11% (25/218) of dogs were seropositive, but no association was found between the serologic results and the presence and infection by T cruzi in triatomines. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the movement of T cruzi in the studied area, by the presence of vectors and naturally infected domestic reservoirs. The mapping of the studied rural area demonstrates the risk of disease transmission.

We present here its rediscovery in ES, 42 years after its first record. Methods: In January 2011, a triatomine specimen was collected from a rural area of the municipality of Santa Teresa, ES. Results: We confirmed this as a new record of R. domesticus in the Baixo Caldeirao locality. Conclusions: This finding supports the possibility of a wild population of R. domesticus in the mountainous region of the Atlantic forest of ES.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is the protozoan pathogen responsible for Chagas disease, which is a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions of developing countries and particularly in Brazil. Despite many studies, there is no efficient treatment against Chagas disease, and the search for new therapeutic targets specific to T. cruzi is critical for drug development. Here, we have revisited 41 protein sequences proposed by the analogous enzyme pipeline, and found that it is possible to provide structures for T. cruzi sequences with clear homologs or analogs in H. sapiens and likely associated with trypanothione reductase, cysteine synthase, and ATPase functions, and structures for sequences specific to T. cruzi and absent in H. sapiens associated with 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, and leishmanolysin activities. The implications of our structures refined by atomistic molecular dynamics (monomer or dimer states) in their in vitro environments (aqueous solution or membrane bilayers) are discussed for drug development and suggest that all protein targets, except cysteine synthase, merit further investigation.

AB  - During a medical entomology course in Boa Vista, Roraima, colonies of Triatoma maculata closely associated with pigeon nests were observed in concrete air-conditioner box located on the external plastered and cemented walls of a modern brick-built apartment block. In only one eight-hole ceramic brick, located inside one air-conditioner box, 127 specimens of T. maculata were collected. T. maculata is a recognised vector of Trypanosoma cruzi in the surrounding area and its domiciliation increases the risk of Chagas disease transmission.

AB  - The aims of the study were to determine the seroprevalence of leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, and to determine the risk factors associated with seropositivity in dogs in the tourist city of Ibiuna, Sao Paulo, Brazil. A total of 570 blood samples of dogs were collected from four regions in the 48 districts of the municipality, from September 2007 to March 2008, and submitted for serological examination. Laboratory diagnosis of leishmaniasis and Chagas disease was performed using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence, respectively. Of the 570 animals examined, 13 (2.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2%-3.8%) were seropositive for leishmaniasis, and 35 (6.1%; 95% CI = 4.3%-8.3%) were seropositive for Chagas disease. A risk factor associated with seropositivity for Chagas disease in dogs was residence in a region with a predominance of small farms generally used for subsistence planting and leisure and surrounded by forest areas (odds ratio = 4.20). By contrast, there were no risk factors identified for leishmaniasis, leading us to conclude that leishmaniasis and Chagas disease are present in dogs in the tourist city of Ibiuna, Sao Paulo; however, additional studies are needed in order to fully define the risk factors associated with disease in this municipality.

AB  - Chronic human infection by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, known as Chagas disease, results in heart failure and death in 20%-30% of affected individuals. Recognition and treatment of the infection are difficult. Disease control requires elimination of the vector, the reduviid bug, that infests housing of poor quality in endemic areas. In South America, control has largely succeeded in the Southern Cone countries-Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, southern Brazil and Sao Paulo, and Paraguay-but lags severely in the Northern Triangle (Central American) countries: El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. Surges in poverty and violence in Central America have increased immigration of persons at risk for Chagas disease to the United States, and immigrants to the United States with Chagas disease face multiple barriers to obtaining effective care. These include issues with financing and payment for health care, limited effectiveness of screening and diagnosis, limited effectiveness of available treatment, and lack of provider awareness, public health education, and research. Each of these barriers presents a unique public health challenge. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background The specific roles of parasite characteristics and immunological factors of the host in Chagas disease progression and prognosis are still under debate. Trypanosoma cruzi genotype may be an important determinant of the clinical chronic Chagas disease form and prognosis. This study aimed to identify the potential association between T. cruzi genotypes and the clinical presentations of chronic Chagas disease.
   Methodology/principal findings This is a retrospective study using T. cruzi isolated from blood culture samples of 43 patients with chronic Chagas disease. From 43 patients, 42 were born in Brazil, mainly in Southeast and Northeast Brazilian regions, and one patient was born in Bolivia. Their mean age at the time of blood collection was 52.413.2 years. The clinical presentation was as follows 51.1% cardiac form, 25.6% indeterminate form, and 23.3% cardiodigestive form. Discrete typing unit (DTU) was determined by multilocus conventional PCR. TcII (n = 40) and TcVI (n = 2) were the DTUs identified. DTU was unidentifiable in one patient. The average follow-up time after blood culture was 5.7 +/- 4.4 years. A total of 14 patients (32.5%) died and one patient underwent heart transplantation. The cause of death was sudden cardiac arrest in six patients, heart failure in five patients, not related to Chagas disease in one patient, and ignored in two patients. A total of 8 patients (18.6%) progressed, all of them within the cardiac or cardiodigestive forms.
   Conclusions/significance TcII was the main T. cruzi DTU identified in chronic Chagas disease Brazilian patients (92.9%) with either cardiac, indeterminate or cardiodigestive forms, born at Southeast and Northeast regions. Other DTU found in much less frequency was TcVI (4.8%). TcII was also associated to patients that evolved with heart failure or sudden cardiac arrest, the two most common and ominous consequences of the cardiac form of Chagas disease.

AB  - Trypanosoma rangeli is an avirulent flagellate protozoan that could mislead correct diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, given their high similarity. Besides, T. rangeli presents two genetic groups, whose differentiation is achieved mainly by molecular approaches. In this context, ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is a useful target for intra and interspecific molecular differentiation. Analyzing the rDNA of T. rangeli and comparison with other trypanosomatid species, two highly divergent regions (Tr beta 1 and Tr beta 2) within the 28S beta gene were found. Those regions were amplified and sequenced in KP1(+) and KP1(-) strains of T. rangeli, revealing group-specific polymorphisms useful for intraspecific distinction through restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Also, amplification of Tr beta 1 allowed differentiation between T. rangeli and T. cruzi. Tr beta 2 predicted restriction length profile, allowed differentiation between T. rangeli, T. cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, and Leishmania braziliensis, increasing the use of Tr beta 1 and Tr beta 2 beyond a molecular approach for T. rangeli genotyping, but also as a useful target for trypanosomatid classification.

AB  - The etiologic agent of Chagas disease is Trypanosoma cruzi, a protozoan whose life cycle involves obligatory passage through vertebrate and invertebrate hosts in a series of stages. The aim of this study was to explore the transferability of mixed discrete typing units (DTUs) of T. cruzi present in chronic chagasic patients when passed through an invertebrate host during xenodiagnosis (XD) and then when transferred to axenic cultures to obtain T. cruzi isolates. DTUs of T. cruzi present in these two hosts and axenic cultures were identified by kDNA PCR amplification and subsequent hybridization with DTU-specific probes. Mixtures of Tc I, Tc II, Tc V and Tc VI DTUs were detected in blood samples. However as a result of XD and axenic cultures it was possible to identify mostly Tc V. We conclude that the transferability of an isolate of T.cruzi derived from mixed DTUs present in human blood depends upon the starved invertebrate host used for xenodiagnosis.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi is a neglected tropical disease with high prevalence (5.7 million in Latin America, WHO 2015), significant burden, and significant morbimortality mostly due to severe heart disorders during the chronic phase of infection. Chagas disease is endemic in Latin America, and medical care for the disease is the major expense for Brazil's Universal Healthcare System (Sistema Unico de Saude (SUS). The efficacy of the available drugs benznidazole and nifurtimox are low for the chronic phase of Chagas disease, the phase in which most patients are diagnosed, and there are frequent side effects, and drug resistance occurs. The rapid deployment of new drug regimens that are effective for the chronic phase treatment is low-cost and less toxic than the currently available therapy, which is a global priority. Repurposing drugs already in clinical use with other combinations would be the fastest and safest strategy for treating Chagas disease patients. We hypothesize that the combined treatment using repurposing drugs with benznidazole will be more efficacious than benznidazole alone. This needs to be tested further both in vitro and in animal models to understand the efficacy of the treatment before performing human clinical trials. We further hypothesize that producing nanoparticle formulation of the drugs can reduce their toxicity and improve therapeutic use.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent for Chagas disease, is widely distributed in the Americas. Its hosts are humans and wild and domestic mammals, and its vectors are triatomine insects. Studies have indicated that domestic dogs are sentinel animals in the epidemiology of Chagas disease in endemic regions, including states in the Legal Amazon region of Brazil. In Sao Luis, the capital of Maranha similar to o, a non-endemic state, the existence of a domestic cycle involving domestic rats has been proven, along with a wild cycle maintained by didelphids. However, no studies on T. cruzi infection in domestic animals in this locality have been conducted. The aim of this study was to investigate occurrence of T. cruzi in dogs living in the Itaqui Bacanga district of Sao Luis, Maranhao, by means of serological and molecular tests. Blood samples were obtained from 330 dogs and structured epidemiological questionnaires were applied to their keepers. These samples were used in the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fisher's exact test was used for statistical calculations with the aim of identifying risk factors. Out of the 330 animals, 105 (31.8%) were reactive in IFAT, 46 (13.0%) in ELISA and 20 (6.0%) in both serological tests. The results were not significant (p > 0.05) when submitted to statistical analysis for the studied variables. From PCR, 58 samples (17.5%) were found to be positive and, of these, one (0.3%) showed similarity to T. cruzi after sequencing. These data demonstrate that dogs were exposed to and infected by T. cruzi. Thus, they can be considered sentinel animals for Chagas disease in the locality studied, which signals that there is a need for epidemiological surveillance actions.

AB  - This survey aimed to assess the presence of triatomine vectors of Chagas disease within the rural communities of Sao Joao do Piaui, Northeast Brazil. Intradomiciliary and peridomiciliary collection strategies were implemented wherein 279 specimens of Triatoma brasiliensis macromelasoma, both nymph and adult were found in 15 (50%) of the studied homes. Of the intradomiciliary insects, 73 (67.6%) were identified as nymph instars (1(st) instar [N1]= 6, N2= 14, N3= 28, N4= 7 and N5= 18). In the studied communities, a continuous interaction between triatomine bugs and humans could be shown. It is therefore urgent that suitable strategies for the control of the triatomine vector are implemented in this area.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas disease remains a public health problem in the rural and urban areas of 19 countries in the Americas. Methods: The aim of the present study was to investigate the Trypanosoma cruzi infection rate of triatomines collected from both intra- and peridomiciliary areas in eleven municipalities of Southeastern Ceara, Brazil, from 2009 to 2015. Results: A total of 32,364 triatomine specimens, including nymphs and adults, were collected, and 31,736 (98.06%) of these were examined. More nymphs were collected than adults, and the greatest number of triatomines (n = 8,548) was collected in 2010, for which the infection rate was 1.3%, with the highest rate of infections observed for specimens from Quixere. The species collected during the study were identified as Triatoma pseudomaculata, Triatoma brasiliensis, Panstrongylus megistus, Panstrongylus lutzi, and Rhodnius nasutus, with T pseudomaculata being the most abundant (n = 19,962). Conclusions: These results verify the presence of triatomines in both intra- and peridomiciliary areas, thereby ensuring persistence of the pathogen and consequently, the disease, as the presence of infected vectors in households is an important risk factor. According to these findings, the Chagas Disease Control Program should intensify its efforts in order to prevent the spread of the disease.

AB  - Introduction: Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease (CD), a zoonotic infection transmitted by triatomine bug vectors to human beings. Although the story of this parasitic infection was born in Brazil and here this has made major step forward information, the same cannot be said about the actual distribution of the triatomine vector in several areas of this country. The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of triatomine species in an endemic region for CD in Northeastern Brazil. Methods: A retrospective study was performed using data obtained from 2008 to 2017. All information was provided by the V Gerencia Regional de Satide of the state of Pernambuco. The spatial distribution of triatominc species was analyzed by drawing a map using the Quantum geographic information system. Results: A total of 4,694 triatomine specimens (469.4 +/- 221.2 per year) were collected during the period 2008-2017, with 94.5% (4,434/4,694) at the intradomicile and 5.5% (260/4,694) at peridomicile environment. Of all arthropods collected, 92.5% (4.340/4,694) and 7.5% (354/4,694) were adults and nymphs, respectively. The species most frequently detected were Panstrongylus lutzi (30.36%), Triatoma brasiliensis (26.12%), Triatoma pseudomaculata (22.43%), and Panstrongylus megistus (20.54%). Conclusions: These data contribute to a better understanding of the distribution of T. cruzi infection in the Northeastern region of Brazil. Preventive measures based on vector control should be implemented in the study area in order to reduce the burden this neglected tropical disease.

AB  - Chagas disease and the leishmaniases are endemic zoonoses of great importance to public health in the state of Piaui, Brazil. The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) is a major reservoir, host of Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. in both urban and rural areas, playing an important role in the transmission of these parasites. The present study evaluated the prevalence of both infectious diseases in dogs of a rural area in the municipality of Sao Joao do Piaui, Piaui State. One hundred twenty-nine blood samples were collected for serological assessment: for the leishmaniases, 49 (38%) animals tested positive by the Dual-Path Platform technology (DPP), nine (6%) by the Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), and 19 (14.7%) by the Indirect Fluorescent Antibody test (IFA); while for American Trypanosomiasis, 36 (28%) dogs were reagent by ELISA and 21 by IFA. Of the 129 dogs sampled, 76 were submitted to xenodiagnosis, bone marrow aspiration and skin biopsy to perform parasitological tests whose results showed only one (2.3%) positive skin sample for Trypanosoma caninum and one positive xenodiagnosis for T. cruzi, both results confirmed by molecular assays. Three hundred triatomines of the species Triatoma brasiliensis and 552 phlebotomines-509 (97%) of the species Lutzomyia longipalpis, were also captured.

AB  - An isolate of Trypanosoma cruzi obtained from P. megistus captured in the peridomicile area of a home in Santo Antonio do Jardim city in the State of Sao Paulo, denominated T. cruzi Mogi, was characterized biologically and molecularly. The RFLP analysis of the D7 divergent domain in the 24S alpha rDNA and of the mini-exon positioned the T. cruzi isolate within the TcI group. Phylogenetic analysis performed with the trypanosomatid barcode confirmed that the isolate belongs to the TcI group, with high homology to the 3014 c1 T. cruzi strain. The biological characterization of the isolate in rats showed a prepatent period of about 8 days, low parasitemia and tropism for cardiac, skeletal and colonic muscles. In Swiss mice the T. cruzi Mogi isolate showed a prepatent period of about 22 days, intermittent parasitemia in some animals, and tropism for cardiac and colonic muscles. Despite the inherent difficulty of identifying correlations amongst the molecular and biological characteristics of different T. cruzi groups, the tropism for colonic muscle demonstrated by T. cruzi Mogi represented a peculiarity of this isolate within the TcI group.

AB  - In a previous publication, I stressed the fundamental importance of research for improving health using as an example the control of Chagas disease in the Americas.((1)) For that purpose, I analysed the major scientific breakthroughs and public health events from the 1909 discovery of Chagas disease and its causative pathogen, Trypanosoma cruzi, by Carlos Chagas,((2)) through the successful control of its transmission by insect vectors in large regions of the Southern Cone countries in the 90s.((3)) In the twenty years since that publication, Brazil and Latin American countries had to cope with a number of serious public health threats, old and new: (i) recrudescence of well-known diseases, such as dengue and yellow fever; (ii) emergence of viral diseases that had been restricted to other continents (Zika, Chikungunya); (iii) new epidemics (H1N1) or (iv) pandemics (COVID-19). Are there still some lessons from that success story against a neglected disease of the 90s that would be relevant today in the context of these recent challenges?

AB  - Chagas disease is a neglected chronic condition with a high burden of morbidity and mortality. It has considerable psychological, social, and economic impacts. The disease represents a significant public health issue in Brazil, with different regional patterns. This document presents the evidence that resulted in the Brazilian Consensus on Chagas Disease. The objective was to review and standardize strategies for diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control of Chagas disease in the country, based on the available scientific evidence. The consensus is based on the articulation and strategic contribution of renowned Brazilian experts with knowledge and experience on various aspects of the disease. It is the result of a close collaboration between the Brazilian Society of Tropical Medicine and the Ministry of Health. It is hoped that this document will strengthen the development of integrated actions against Chagas disease in the country, focusing on epidemiology, management, comprehensive care (including families and communities), communication, information, education, and research.

AB  - Updated information of the dispersion dynamics of Chagas disease (CD) and a systemic analysis of these data will aid the early identification of areas that are vulnerable to transmission and enable efficient intervention. This work synthesized spatiotemporal information regarding triatomine fauna and analyzed this information in combination with the results from serological tests to elucidate the epidemiological panorama of CD in the state of Sergipe, Brazil. This is a retrospective analytical study that utilized information from the database of the National Chagas Disease Control Program. Between 2010 and 2016, 838 triatomines of eight species, namely, Panstrongylus geniculatus, which was first recorded in the state of Sergipe, Panstrongylus lutzi, P. megistus, Triatoma brasiliensis, T. pseudomaculata, T. tibiamaculata, T. melanocephala, and Rhodnius neglectus, were collected. Optical microscopy revealed that 13.2% of triatomines examined were infected by Trypanosoma cruzi-like flagellates. The distribution of triatomines exhibits an expanding south-central to northern dispersion, with a preference for semiarid and agreste areas and occasional observations in humid coastal areas due to anthropogenic actions reflected in the environment. Of the human cases analyzed from 2012 to 2016, 8.3% (191/2316) presented positive serology for Trypanosoma cruzi, and this proportion showed a gradual increase in the southern center of the state and new notifications in coastal regions. There is a need for intensification and continuity of the measures adopted by the Chagas Disease Control Program in Sergipe, identifying new priority areas for intervention and preferential ecotopes of the vectors, considering the occurrence of positive triatomines intradomicilliary and a source of new triatomines in the peridomiciles.

AB  - Chagas' disease is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, described in the early 20(th) century by the Brazilian physician Dr. Carlos Chagas. There was a great amount of research devoted to diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the disease. One of the most important discoveries made since then, impacting the understanding of how the parasite interacts with the host's immune system, was the description of trans-sialidase. It is an unique enzyme, capable of masking the parasite's presence from the host, while at the same time dampening the activation of CD8+ T cells, the most important components of the immune response. Since the description of Chagas' disease in 1909, extensive research has identified important events in the disease in order to understand the biochemical mechanism that modulates T. cruzi-host cell interactions and the ability of the parasite to ensure its survival. The importance of the trans-sialidase enzyme brought life to many studies for the design of diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines. While many groups have been prolific, such efforts have encountered problems, among them: the fact that while T. cruzi have many genes that are unique to the parasite, it relies on multiple copies of them and the difficulty in providing epitopes that result in effective and robust immune responses. In this review, we aim to convey the importance of trans-sialidase as well as to provide a history, including the initial failures and the most promising successes in the chasing of a working vaccine for a disease that is endemic in many tropical countries, including Brazil.

AB  - Introduction: Rhodnius stali infection by Trypanosoma rangeli is reported in this study for the first time. Methods: The triatomines were collected from the campus of the Federal University of Acre in Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil. The identification of T. rangeli was confirmed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Results: The examinations of two specimens revealed R. stali infection by the epimastigote forms of T. rangeli. Conclusions: The encounter of R. stali infected by T. rangeli generates an alert for the state of Acre, since the simultaneous presence with Trypanosoma cruzi can make the differential diagnosis of Chagas disease difficult.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas disease (CD) is currently considered a neglected disease; hence, identifying the factors associated with its high prevalence is essential. This study aimed to identify the seroprevalence of and the possible factors associated with CD in inhabitants of the City of Limoeiro do Norte, northeastern Brazil. Methods: Between April and November 2013, blood collection was conducted and a semi-structured questionnaire was administered. Blood samples that showed positive or possible serology for anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies based on indirect immunofluorescence, hemagglutination indirect, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were analyzed. Associations between CD positivity and the study variables were analyzed using prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: A total of 812 individuals were analyzed, of which T. cruzi seropositivity was determined in 4.2% (34 individuals). Sociodemographic variables showing a significant association with T. cruzi positivity included age > 50 years (PR = 27.6; 95% CI = 6.66-114.4), elementary level education (PR = 5.15; 95% CI = 1.83-14.47), and retirement (PR = 7.25; 95% CI = 3.72-14.14). Positivity for T. cruzi was 6.17 times higher in those who had a history of living in rammed earth houses compared with those who did not (95% CI = 2.19-17.37). There was no evidence of vertical transmission in the individuals studied. Among the individuals infected with T. cruzi, the majority reported having a comorbidity (p < 0.01). Conclusions: This study demonstrated the seroprevalence of CD and identified factors associated with a high prevalence of CD.

AB  - Obstetrician-gynecologists in the United States have little clinical experience with the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of Chagas disease. The number of US parturients born in Central and South America has continued to increase over the last 20 years, making US obstetricians more and more likely to care for Chagas-infected mothers who may never be identified until dealing with long-term consequences of the disease. A literature search demonstrates that few US obstetric care providers recognize the risk of vertical transmission for the neonate and the missed opportunity of infant treatment to decrease disease prevalence. Most women will be asymptomatic during pregnancy, as will their neonates, making routine laboratory screening a necessity for the identification of at-risk neonates. While the benefits of treating asymptomatic women identified in pregnancy are not as clear as the benefits for the infants, future health screenings for evidence of the progression of Chagas disease may be beneficial to these families. The literature suggests that screening for Chagas in pregnancy in the US can be done in a cost-effective way. When viewed through an equity lens, this condition disproportionately affects families of lower socioeconomic means. Improved education of healthcare providers and appropriate resources for diagnosis and treatment can improve this disparity in health outcomes.

AB  - We used an individual-based molecular multisource approach to assess the epidemiological importance of Triatoma brasiliensis collected in distinct sites and ecotopes in Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil. In the semi-arid zones of Brazil, this blood sucking bug is the most important vector of Trypanosoma cruzi-the parasite that causes Chagas disease. First, cytochrome b (cytb) and microsatellite markers were used for inferences on the genetic structure of five populations (108 bugs). Second, we determined the natural T. cruzi infection prevalence and parasite diversity in 126 bugs by amplifying a mini-exon gene from triatomine gut contents. Third, we identified the natural feeding sources of 60 T. brasiliensis by using the blood meal content via vertebrate cytb analysis. Demographic inferences based on cytb variation indicated expansion events in some sylvatic and domiciliary populations. Microsatellite results indicated gene flow between sylvatic and anthropic (domiciliary and peridomiciliary) populations, which threatens vector control efforts because sylvatic population are uncontrollable. A high natural T. cruzi infection prevalence (52-71%) and two parasite lineages were found for the sylvatic foci, in which 68% of bugs had fed on Kerodon rupestris (Rodentia: Caviidae), highlighting it as a potential reservoir. For peridomiciliary bugs, Galea spixii (Rodentia: Caviidae) was the main mammal feeding source, which may reinforce previous concerns about the potential of this animal to link the sylvatic and domiciliary T. cruzi cycles.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania sp. are important protozoan parasites for humans and animals in the Americas, causing Chagas disease and cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis, respectively. These vector-borne diseases affect permanent and transient populations in developing tropical countries that exhibit favorable conditions for the perpetuation of the parasite cycle. Our objective was to investigate the occurrence of infection with these parasites in wild animals from urban rainforest fragments in the city of Salvador, the largest city in the northeast region of Brazil. Sixty-five wild animals were captured, clinically examined, and sampled for parasite detection by PCR and culture. Ten different mammalian genera were identified, being 58% (38/65) marsupials. The prevalence of T. cruzi and Leishmania sp. infections was 13% and 43%, respectively. Both parasites were detected by PCR in 11% (7/65), three of which were also double infected as determined by culture. Among the 28 animals found infected with at least one parasite (43%, 28/65), 68% (19/28) were marsupials, two specimens were Callithrix sp. (7%), and one was Trinomys sp. (3%). Most infected animals (89%) had no clinical signs of disease. We found that healthy free-living animals from urban rainforest fragments harbored pathogenic trypanosomatids and should be included in epidemiology studies of diseases in big cities in tropical countries, as these cities grow and engulf rainforest remnants.

AB  - To better understand the ecology of Trypanosoma cruzi in the northeastern Peruvian Amazon, we evaluated the prevalence of T. cruzi and other trypanosomatids in four orders of wild mammals hunted and consumed by inhabitants of three remote indigenous communities in the Peruvian Amazon. Of 300 wild mammals sampled, 115 (38.3%) were infected with trypanosomatids and 15 (5.0%) with T. cruzi. The prevalence of T. cruzi within each species was as follows: large rodents (Cuniculus paca, 5.5%; Dasyprocta spp., 2.6%), edentates (Dasypus novemcinctus, 4.2%), and carnivores with higher prevalence (Nasua nasua, 18.8%). The high prevalence of T. cruzi and other trypanosomatids in frequently hunted wild mammals suggests a sizeable T. cruzi sylvatic reservoir in remote Amazonian locations.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) has been considered endemic in the South of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) State, Brazil. This study aimed at evaluating the occurrence of Trypanosoma cruzi vectors based on the main species captured in Southern Rio Grande do Sul State from 2008 to 2019. The study area comprised counties that belong to the 3Rd Regional Health Coordination (RHC) and to the 7th RHC, whose headquarters are in Pelotas and Bage, respectively. The study was based on secondary data provided by the partnership between the Federal University of Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul State (UFPel-RS) and the State Health Surveillance Center in RS (SCHS-RS). One thousand and four hundred triatomines were captured in the area supervised by the 3rd RHC, mainly in Cangucu (37.7%), Piratini (22.4%) and Pinheiro Machado (15.1%), while, in the area supervised by the 7th RHC, the largest number of triatomines was captured in Lavras do Sul (64.15%). In both areas, Triatoma rubrovaria (90.6%) and Panstrongylus tupynambai (7.4%) were the most common species. Most were captured inside households but T.cruzi-positive insects were not found in the period under study. The results of this study show that, in Southern Rio Grande do Sul State, there is still a high rate of triatomine household invasion and dispersal, mainly by T. rubrovaria. Thus, the entomological surveillance should be maintained with the participation of the population and further studies should be deepened in the area.

AB  - Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC) is one of the chronic manifestations of Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) infection and is a major public health disease in Latin America. Since it is a chronic systemic infection, Chagas disease was long considered a potential contraindication for transplantation because of the risk of recurrence with immunosuppression. However, early South American experience in the 1980's established the feasibility of heart transplantation (HT) in patients with Chagas disease. Indeed, the first cardiac transplant for a recipient with CC was performed in 1985 in Brazil. Chagas etiology of heart failure has become the third most common indication for HT in South America. T. cruzi reactivation post-transplant is a common issue that requires prophylactic surveillance but responds well to appropriate therapy. Chagas reactivation has been associated with the potency of the immunosuppressive protocol and occurs more frequently after rejection episodes. Yet, many important questions regarding the management of Chagas HT candidates and recipients remain unanswered. For example, biventricular systolic failure is frequent in end-stage CC, but its impact on the modality of mechanical circulatory bridging has not been described. Also, there is no consensus regarding the most adequate immunosuppressive regimen that balances the risk of graft rejection and disease reactivation. The real efficacy and safety of HT for end-stage CC will only be appreciated when a Latin American transplant registry is established. This review covers the current state of the art of HT for CC.

AB  - Currently, oral infection is the most frequent transmission mechanism of Chagas disease in Brazil and others Latin American countries. This transmission pathway presents increased mortality rate in the first 2 weeks, which is higher than the calculated mortality after the biting of infected insect vectors. Thus, the oral route of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, and the consequences in the host must be taken into account when thinking on the mechanisms underlying the natural history of the disease. Distinct routes of parasite entry may differentially affect immune circuits, stimulating regional immune responses that impact on the overall profile of the host protective immunity. Experimental studies related to oral infection usually comprise inoculation in the mouth (oral infection, OI) or gavage (gastrointestinal infection, GI), being often considered as similar routes of infection. Hence, establishing a relationship between the inoculation site (OI or GI) with disease progression and the mounting of T. cruzi-specific regional immune responses is an important issue to be considered. Here, we provide a discussion on studies performed in OI and GI in experimental models of acute infections, including T. cruzi infection.

AB  - Background: Neglected tropical diseases are a growing threat to global health, and endemic Chagas disease has emerged as one of the most important health problems in America. The main strategy to prevent Trypanosoma cruzi transmission is chemical control of vectors. This study presents a descriptive analysis of synanthropic triatomines before and after the implementation of a vector-control program in Bahia, Brazil.
   Methods: Descriptive analysis and geospatial statistics were performed on triatomine data, (1) the relative abundance and (2) proportional spatial distribution, from Bahia during two periods: (A) 1957 to 1971 and (B) 2006 to 2019.
   Results: We observed a decrease in the relative abundance of Panstrongylus megistus (A: n=22.032, 61.9%; B: n=1.842, 1.0%) and Triatoma infestans (A: n=1.310, 3.7%; B: n=763, 0.43%), as well as an increase in the relative abundance of T. sordida (A: n=8.314, 23.4%, B: n=146.901, 81.6%) and T. pseudomaculata (A: n=894, 2.5%, B: n=16.717, 9.3%).
   Conclusions: Our results indicate a clear reduction in the occurrence of P. megistus and T. infestans (last record in 2015) and an increase in the relative abundance and geographical distribution of T. sordida and T. pseudomaculata after 40 years of the vector-control program. The high frequency of other triatomine species in the municipalities of the state of Bahia and their abundance in recent years highlight the need to reinforce permanent entomological surveillance actions to prevent Chagas disease.

AB  - Chagas disease is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted, mainly, by hematophagous insects of the Triatominae subfamily. In Brazil, there are currently about 66 triatomine species distributed throughout the country's 27 states. Triatoma infestans is considered as a species of great vectorial importance, mainly because of its biological characteristics, such as the high degree of anthropophilia, adaptation to the home environment, ability to withstand long periods of fasting, and present a wide geographical distribution. Taking into account the epidemiological importance of these species, we carried out the first report of T. infestans in the Espi ' rito Santo, Brazil, and development of an identification key for all species notified in that state, based on cytogenetic data. This information is important because they contribute to the direction of epidemiological surveillance activities carried out by vector control programs of the Espi ' rito Santo, Brazil.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is an anthropozoonosis of great importance for public health. Several species of mammals are reservoirs for this parasite, including dogs. The objective of this work was to verify the natural infection by T. cruzi in the population of dogs of the municipality of Itubera, Bahia. A total of 392 domiciled dogs from all districts of the city were evaluated; five milliliters of blood was collected from the dogs for molecular diagnosis. T. cruzi DNA was amplified through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR); the primers P35 and P36, which amplify a fragment of 330 bp, were used. The PCR products were subjected to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis containing Svbr (Invitrogen). Of the 392 dogs evaluated, only 2 (0.51%) animals, one male and one female, tested positive for T. cruzi. This study concluded that there are dogs naturally infected by T. cruzi in the municipality of Itubera-Bahia and that this finding is an alert to veterinarians, health professionals, and local health authorities that their own dogs can act as reservoirs of the disease.

AB  - Dogs are as considered important reservoirs of trypanosomiasis and play a vital role in maintaining the interaction between the domestic and wild cycles of this disease. This paper reports the clinical and pathological findings of a case of Chagas disease myocarditis in a dog from an urban area in Brazil. During clinical examination, the animal showed apathy, weakness and pale ocular mucous and died shortly after. Necropsy revealed ascites, hydrothorax and hydropericardium. The heart was remarkably globoid with scattered multifocal pale in the epicardium and ventricular miocardium and dilated chambers. Histological analysis revealed non-suppurative myocarditis and cardiomyocyte necrosis. The sarcoplasms of cardiomyocytes were frequently infiltrated by T. cruzi pseudocysts filled with amastigotes. The myocardium immunostained positive for anti-T. cruzi antibody. The presence of Chagas disease in a dog from an urban area increases the risk of disease transmission to man, which renders this diagnosis a matter of significant public health concern.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, remains a neglected endemic infection that affects around 8 million people worldwide and causes 12,000 premature deaths per year. Traditional chemotherapy is limited to the nitro-antiparasitic drugs Benznidazole and Nifurtimox, which present serious side effects and low long-term efficacy. Several research efforts have been made over the last decade to find new chemical structures with better effectiveness and tolerance than standard anti-Chagas drugs. Among these, new sets of thiosemicarbazone and thiazole derivatives have exhibited potent in vitro activity against T. cruzi, especially for its extracellular forms (epimastigote and trypomastigote). In this work, we have developed three antiprotozoal quantitative structure-relationship (QSAR) models for Chagas disease based on the in vitro activity data reported as IC50 (mu M) and CC50 (mu M) over the last decade, particularly by Lima-Leite's group in Brazil. The models were developed using the replacement method (RM), a technique based on Multivariable Linear Regression (MLR), and external and internal validation methodologies, like the use of a test set, Leave-one-Out (LOO) cross-validation and Y-Randomization. Two of these QSAR models were developed for trypomastigotes form of the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, one based on IC50 and the other on CC50 data; while the third QSAR model was developed for its epimastigotes form based on CC50 activity. Our models presented sound statistical parameters that endorses their prediction capability. Such capability was tested for a set of 13 hitherto-unknown structurally related aromatic cyclohexanone derivatives. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Chagas disease is a major public health problem in Latin America. A neglected disease of poor and rural Latin American populations, it has now emerged in other regions and urban areas due to international migration. In Colombia, systematic data pertaining to the disease's magnitude in the general population and its distribution within regions are lacking. Our objective is to describe the prevalence of Chagas disease in Colombia through a meta-analysis and systematic review. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search using several electronic databases, gray literature, and reference lists of selected articles for population-based studies on Chagas disease prevalence in Colombia was performed between 1990 and 2017. Articles published in either English or Spanish were included. Pooled prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for Chagas disease in the general population using a meta-analysis random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity among studies. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether publication bias existed. Results: Seventeen articles with relevant prevalence data were identified from a total of 1213 references. The initial pooled estimate of Chagas disease prevalence across studies for the entire period was 4.10% (95% CI: 2.23-7.41). After removing studies with large effect and small sample sizes, the pooled estimate was 1.67% (95% CI: 0.95-2.92). A high degree of heterogeneity in most pooled estimates was observed, even after subgroup analysis. The Orinoquia region, rural areas, males, and persons aged >= 15 years yielded the highest pooled prevalence. Interpretation and Conclusion: Higher prevalence was observed in select regions, rural areas, and older teenagers and adults. Additional population-based studies within Colombia are recommended to provide more stable and reliable estimates and identify high-risk areas and groups.

AB  - We previously reported that tandem repeat (TR) proteins from Trypanosoma cruzi could serve as targets of the antibody response and be useful as diagnostic indicators. To optimize reagents for detecting T. cruzi infection we evaluated individual TR proteins and identified several that were recognized by the majority of Chagas patient's sera collected from individuals form Brazil. We then produced novel, recombinant fusion proteins to combine the reactive TR proteins into a single diagnostic product. Direct comparison of the antibody response of serum samples that were readily detected by the established fusion antigen used in commercial detection of Chagas disease, TcF, revealed strong responses to TcF43 and TcF26 proteins. While the TcF43 and TcF26 antigens enhanced detection and strength of signal, they did not compromise the specificity of detection compared to that obtained with TcF. Finally, it was apparent by testing against a panel of 84 serum samples assembled on the basis of moderate or weak reactivity against TcF (mostly signal:noise <5) that TcF43 and TcF26 could more strongly detected by many of the sera that had low TcF antibody levels. Taken together, these data indicate that TcF43 and TcF26 could be used to enhance the detection of T. cruzi infection as well as supporting a diagnosis of Chagas disease. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: In rural areas of Espirito Santo state, southeast Brazil, triatomine species attracted by light frequently invade residences. The aim of this study was to investigate the Trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs) harbored by these triatomines. Methods: Triatomine's intestinal contents were examined, inoculated in mice, and the positive samples were cultivated. Flagellates obtained from infected mice hemoculture were submitted to DNA extraction using a salting-out method and to TcSC5D gene amplification. The amplified samples were sequenced, and polymorphism was analyzed for DTU identification. Results: Three hundred and ninety-four triatomines were identified: Triatoma vitticeps (90.03%), Panstrongylus geniculatus (8.89%), Panstrongylus megistus (0.54%), Panstrongylus diasi (0.27%), and Triatoma tibiamaculata (0.27%). Among the specimens, 251/394 (67.65%) presented flagellated forms similar to T. cruzi. After triatomine intestinal content inoculation into mice, 134 mice presented T. cruzi-like trypomastigotes from Tr. vitticeps and P. geniculatus and 89 samples were positive in hemoculture. Sixty-two samples were analyzed for the TcSC5D gene and TcI, TcII, TcIII, and TcIV DTUs were identified. Conclusions: We observed T. cruzi DTU diversity in Tr. vitticeps and P. geniculatus, which showed the predominance of TcII and occurrence of TcI, TcIII and TcIV. Triatomines presented high T. cruzi infection rates. Since little is known regarding the possible mammalian hosts that maintain the T. cruzi cycle, further studies are necessary to obtain a better understanding of the parasite transmission cycle in this region.

AB  - BackgroundThe significance of detection of Trypanosoma cruziDNA in blood of antibody-positive patients for risk of development of Chagas heart disease is not well established. The objective of this study was to compare detection of T. cruziDNA with known clinical and laboratory markers of Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC) severity.
   MethodsThis is a case-control study nested within a retrospective cohort developed in Brazil to understand the natural history of Chagas disease. The study enrolled 499 T. cruzi seropositive blood donors (SP-BD) and 488 frequency matched seronegative control donors (SN-BD) who had donated between 1996 and 2002, and 101 patients with clinically diagnosed CC. In 2008-2010 all enrolled subjects underwent a health questionnaire, medical examination, electrocardiograms and echocardiograms and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. A blinded panel of three cardiologists adjudicated the outcome of CC. Trypanosoma cruzi kinetoplast minicircle sequences were amplified by real-time PCR using an assay with a sensitivity of one parasite per 20mL of blood. All testing was performed on coded samples.
   ResultsRates of PCR detection of T. cruziDNA were significantly (P=0.003) higher in CC patients and SP-BD diagnosed with CC (79/105 [75.2 %]) compared with SP-BD without CC (143/279 [51.3%]). The presence of parasitaemia was significantly associated with known markers of disease progression such as QRS and QT interval duration, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher left ventricular index mass, and elevated troponin and NTpro-BNP levels.
   ConclusionTrypanosoma cruziPCR positivity is associated with presence and severity of cardiomyopathy, suggesting a direct role of parasite persistence in disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Serological tests are preferentially used for the diagnosis of Chagas' disease (CD) during the chronic phase because of the low parasitemia and high anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibody titers. However, the current methods showed several disadvantages, as contradictory or inconclusive results, mainly related to the characteristics of the antigens used, in general, crude or whole parasites, but also due to antigen production protocol and the experimental conditions used in serological tests. Thus, better-quality serological assays are urgently needed. Here, we performed a wide immunogenomic screen strategy to identify conserved linear B-cell epitopes in the predicted proteome based on genome sequence from T. cruzi strains to will be applied as synthetic peptides in the serodiagnosis of the chronic CD. Three B-cell epitopes derived from mucin-associated surface protein (MASP) family, expressed in both infective parasite stages, trypomastigote and amastigotes, conserved in T. cruzi strains, and highly divergent as compared with Leishmania spp. proteome, were selected for this study. The results demonstrated that synthetic peptide 2 and a mixture of peptides (Mix II: peptides 2 and 3) were able to identify all chronic CD cases, indeterminate or Chagas cardiomyopathy clinical presentation, and simultaneously able to discriminate infections caused by Leishmania parasites, with high accuracy (98.37 and 100.00%, respectively) and agreement (kappa index = 0.967 and 1.000, respectively) with direct methods as compared to current diagnostic pipeline performed by reference laboratories in Brazil. This study represents an interesting strategy for the discovery of new antigens applied to serologic diagnosis of infectious diseases and for the technological development of platforms for large-scale production of diagnostic tests.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is a parasitic zoonosis endemic in Brazil. Despite virtual control of Triatoma infestans, the main domesticated vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, vectorial transmission by other triatomine species persists in some rural communities. This study aims to characterize triatomines role in transmitting T. cruzi to dogs and humans in the district of Santo In ' acio, located in the northwest region of the state of Bahia, Brazil. It also describes environmental factors in housings associated with insect occurrence and assesses the perception, knowledge, and preventive practices adopted by the population regarding CD. Blood samples of humans and dogs, and biological samples of triatomines, were collected between November 2018 and February 2019 and subjected to the detection of T. cruzi by serological and molecular biology tests. Also, we applied a questionnaire to research the perception, knowledge, and local practices of people related to CD. The capture of triatomines in households was associated with exploratory variables of the questionnaires using multivariate logistic regression (p < 0.05). The 155 triatomines captured in the wild and domestic environment were of the species Triatoma sherlocki (n = 151), Panstrongylus sherlocki (n = 1) and Triatoma sordida (n = 3), and had a natural infection rate for T. cruzi by PCR of 18.5%, 100% and 0%, respectively. District residents (n = 126) were seronegative for T. cruzi, while 17.5% (7/40) of the dogs were seropositive. The fact that residents are aware that triatomines can "cause" CD was configured as a protection factor for residents according to the fitted logistic regression model (p = 0.04). However, respondents have limited perception and knowledge about the CD, prevention and control practices for triatomines in a household. The results suggest the existence of a domestic cycle of transmission of T. cruzi between triatomines and dogs, configuring a latent risk of infection to the human population of Santo In ' acio. Studies that clarify the potential for the establishing of intrusive triatomines in households, surveillance actions for triatomines, and health education in rural communities are indispensable to prevent the reemergence of CD in vulnerable regions of Brazil and other American countries with similar epidemiological characteristics.

AB  - This review deals with transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi by the most important domestic vectors, blood transfusion and oral intake. Among the vectors, Triatoma infestans, Panstrongylus megistus, Rhodnius prolixus, Triatoma dimidiata, Triatoma brasiliensis, Triatoma pseudomaculata, Triatoma sordida, Triatoma maculata, Panstrongylus geniculatus, Rhodnius ecuadoriensis and Rhodnius pallescens can be highlighted. Transmission of Chagas infection, which has been brought under control in some countries in South and Central America, remains a great challenge, particularly considering that many endemic countries do not have control over blood donors. Even more concerning is the case of non-endemic countries that receive thousands of migrants from endemic areas that carry Chagas disease, such as the United States of America, in North America, Spain, in Europe, Japan, in Asia, and Australia, in Oceania. In the Brazilian Amazon Region, since Shaw et al. (1969) described the first acute cases of the disease caused by oral transmission, hundreds of acute cases of the disease due to oral transmission have been described in that region, which is today considered to be endemic for oral transmission. Several other outbreaks of acute Chagas disease by oral transmission have been described in different states of Brazil and in other South American countries.

AB  - This study estimates the factors of artificial environments (houses and peridomestic areas) associated with Triatoma sordida occurrence. Manual searches for triatomines were performed in 136 domiciliary units (DUs) in two rural localities of Central-West Brazil. For each DU, 32 structural, 23 biotic and 28 management variables were obtained. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed in order to identify statistically significant variables associated with occurrence of T. sordida in the study areas. A total of 1,057 specimens (99% in peridomiciles, mainly chicken coops) of T. sordida were collected from 63 DUs (infestation: 47%; density: similar to 8 specimens/DU; crowding: similar to 17 specimens/infested DU; colonisation: 81%). Only six (0.6%) out of 945 specimens examined were infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. The final adjusted logistic regression model indicated that the probability of T. sordida occurrence was higher in DU with wooden chicken coops, presence of > 30 animals in wooden corrals, presence of wood piles and presence of food storeroom. The results show the persistence of T. sordida in peridomestic habitats in rural localities of Central-West Brazil. However, the observed low intradomestic colonisation and minimal triatomine infection rates indicate that T. sordida has low potential to sustain high rates of T. cruzi transmission to residents of these localities.

AB  - Triatoma vitticeps is a Chagas disease vector that was found infected with Trypanosoma cruzi in homes. As this species is endemic from Brazil (Bahia, Espirito Santo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro) and no study comparing the specimens from different Brazilian states was conducted, we analyzed the genetic distance (16S rDNA, Cyt b, and COI mitochondrial genes) and the chromosomal characteristics for T. vitticeps from Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and Espirito Santo. All specimens showed the same cytogenetic characteristics. On the other hand, the different mitochondrial genes demonstrated high intraspecific variation between the genetic distances of T. vitticeps from different states ranging from 2.3% to 7.2%. Based on this, our results suggest that possibly what is characterized as T. vitticeps is a complex of cryptic species (or subspecies).

AB  - Chagas disease remains an important public health problem with high morbidity and mortality in several Latin American countries. This nationwide population-based ecological study analyzes the epidemiological characteristics and time trends of Chagas disease-related mortality in Brazil, 2000-2019. We included all deaths reported in Brazil in which Chagas disease was mentioned in the death certificate either as an underlying or associated cause of death (multiple causes of death). Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates (per 100,000 inhabitants) were calculated and time trends analysis was performed using joinpoint regression models. In the study period, a total of 22,663,092 deaths were recorded in Brazil. Chagas disease was identified in 122,291 deaths (0.54%), 94.788 (77.5%) as an underlying cause and 27,503 (22.5%) as an associated cause. Average annual age-adjusted mortality rate was 3.22 deaths/100,000 inhabitants (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.143.30). Chronic Chagas disease with cardiac involvement was the predominant clinical presentation mentioned. The highest mortality rates were observed in males, age group >= 80 years, black race/skin color, schooling 1-3 years of study, and residents in the Central-West region. Age-adjusted mortality rates showed a significant declining trend at the national level in the period (Average Annual Percent Change: -3.1%; 95% CI: -3.3; -3.0), with different local patterns and a more pronounced reduction in important endemic areas in the past. The findings show that, despite a consistent decline in mortality rates in Brazil over the study period, Chagas disease remains an important and neglected cause of death in the country, showing a marked regional variation that has social and health care implications. In addition to the control measures for disease transmission, it is necessary to guarantee access, coverage, and quality of health care to Chagas disease patients, seeking to prevent the occurrence of severe forms and deaths from the disease.

AB  - We used the gut contents of triatomines collected from rural areas of Ceara State, northeastern Brazil, to identify their putative hosts via vertebrate cytb gene sequencing. Successful direct sequencing was obtained for 48% of insects, comprising 50 Triatoma brasiliensis, 7 Triatoma pseudomaculata, and 1 Rhodnius nasutus. Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) procedure revealed that domestic animals, such as chickens (Gallus gallus) and goats (Capra hircus), are the main food source, including in sylvatic environment. Native hosts were also detected in peridomestic environment such as reptiles (Tropidurus sp. and Iguana iguana) and the Galen spixii (Rodentia: Caviidae). The role of goats and Galea spixii in Chagas disease epidemiology calls for further studies, because these mammals likely link the sylvatic and domestic Trypanosoma cruzi cycles.

AB  - Chagas disease is caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi affecting millions of people, and widespread throughout Latin America. This disease exhibits a problematic chemotherapy. Benznidazole, which is the drug currently used as standard treatment, lamentably evokes several adverse reactions. Among other options, natural products have been tested to discover a novel therapeutic drug for this disease. A lot of plants from the Brazilian flora did not contain studies about their biological effects. Restinga de Jurubatiba from Brazil is a sandbank ecosystem poorly studied in relation to plant biological activity. Thus, three plant species from Restinga de Jurubatiba were tested against in vitro antiprotozoal activity. Among six extracts obtained from leaves and stem parts and 2 essential oils derived from leave parts, only 3 extracts inhibited epimastigote proliferation. Substances present in the extracts with activity were isolated (quercetin, myricetin, and ursolic acid), and evaluated in relation to antiprotozoal activity against epimastigote Y and Dm28 Trypanosoma cruzi strains. All isolated substances were effective to reduce protozoal proliferation. Essentially, quercetin and myricetin did not cause mammalian cell toxicity. In summary, myricetin and quercetin molecule can be used as a scaffold to develop new effective drugs against Chagas's disease.

AB  - South American opossums of the order Didelphimorphia are considered sentinels for zoonotic infections and environmental diseases, such as for Chagas disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of data regarding protozoan diseases such Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum in Neotropical marsupials; despite these pathogens have been considered threats to some marsupial species. The aim of this study was to determine whether Didelphis albiventris and Philander frenatus opossums from southern Brazil had been previously exposed to T. cruzi, T. gondii or N. caninum. Opossum samples were obtained by live-trapping of free-ranging animals and collection at wildlife rehabilitation centers in Rio Grande do Sul (RS) state, Brazil. The detection of anti-T. cruzi and anti-T. gondii antibodies was performed by indirect hemagglutination and anti-N. caninum antibodies by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In total, samples were collected from 76 marsupials from nine municipalities in RS state, including 69 D. albiventris (white-eared opossum), and seven were P. frenatus (southern four-eyed opossum). For T. cruzi, 11% were seropositive, and for T. gondii 26% were seropositive. None of the marsupials sampled here were seropositive for N. caninum. Risk factor analysis showed that free-living animals were about five-fold more likely to be infected by T. gondii than were rescued animals. Our study showed the exposure of Neotropical marsupials (D. albiventris and P. frenatus) to protozoan pathogens T. cruzi and T. gondii, while no evidence of N. caninum exposure was found. The set of results presented here may have an effect on ecology and conservation of the studied species and may also indicate possible sentinels of these pathogen circulation.

AB  - Trypanosomatids are hemoflagellate parasites that even though they have been increasingly studied, many aspects of their biology and taxonomy remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the Trypanosoma sp. transmission cycle in nonflying small mammals in an area where a case of acute Chagas disease occurred in Mangaratiba municipality, Rio de Janeiro state. Three expeditions were conducted in the area: the first in 2012, soon after the human case, and two others in 2015. Sylvatic mammals were captured and submitted to blood collection for trypanosomatid parasitological and serological exams. Dogs from the surrounding areas where the sylvatic mammals were captured were also tested for T. cruzi infection. DNA samples were extracted from blood clots and positive hemocultures, submitted to polymerase chain reaction targeting SSU rDNA and gGAPDH genes, sequenced and phylogenetic analysed. Twenty-one wild mammals were captured in 2012, mainly rodents, and 17 mammals, mainly marsupials, were captured in the two expeditions conducted in 2015. Only four rodents demonstrated borderline serological T. cruzi test (IFAT), two in 2012 and two in 2015. Trypanosoma janseni was the main Trypanosoma species identified, and isolates were obtained solely from Didelphis aurita. In addition to biological differences, molecular differences are suggestive of genetic diversity in this flagellate species. Trypanosoma sp. DID was identified in blood clots from D. aurita in single and mixed infections with T. janseni. Concerning dogs, 12 presented mostly borderline serological titers for T. cruzi and no positive hemoculture. In blood clots from 11 dogs, T. cruzi DNA was detected and characterized as TcI (n = 9) or TcII (n = 2). Infections by Trypanosoma rangeli lineage E (n = 2) and, for the first time, Trypanosoma caninum, Trypanosoma dionisii, and Crithidia mellificae (n = 1 each) were also detected in dogs. We concluded that despite the low mammalian species richness and degraded environment, a high Trypanosoma species richness species was being transmitted with the predominance of T. janseni and not T. cruzi, as would be expected in a locality of an acute case of Chagas disease.

AB  - Chagas disease is an important endemic morbidity in Latin America affecting millions of people in the American continent. It is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, and transmitted through the feces of the insect vector belonging to the subfamily Triatominae. The present conducted an entomological survey of triatomines and analyzed entomological indicators, such as the rate of infestation, colonization, triatomine density and natural infection in rural communities in the municipality of Campinas do Piaui, Piaui State, in the Northeast region of Brazil. Data on the search of triatomines performed in 167 domiciliary units (DUs), harvested during the period of February to July 2019, in 12 rural communities were analyzed. The capture of triatomines occurred in all studied communities, being 76 the number of positive DUs, of the 167 surveyed, presenting a global rate of infestation of 45.51%. Two triatomines species were collected: Triatoma brasiliensis (98.49%) and T. pseudomaculata (1.51%), the first was found in the domiciliary and peridomiciliary areas, while the second was captured only in peridomiciliary areas. The index of colonization was 17.1%. Natural infection was observed only in 5.44% of T. brasiliensis samples. The entomological survey was conducted in rural communities, showingthe risk of transmission of Chagas disease to the local population, requiring continuous entomological surveillance and vector control.

AB  - Outbreaks of acute Chagas disease (ACD) in northern Brazil can be caused by the ingestion of unprocessed agai pulp contaminated with Trypanosoma cruzi. The aim of this study was to determine the minimum thermal process required to inactivate T. cruzi in acai pulp. Trypomastigotes (100,000) of T. cruzi Y strain were added to 0.15 M NaCl or agai pulp and continuously mixed while being heat treated at 37 to 49 degrees C for up to 1 h. When necessary, parasites were separated from agai pulp by forced sieving. Inocula were administrated intraperitoneally in inbred immunodeficient C.B-17-Prkdc(soid)/Pas Unib mice, and the recipients were monitored for parasitemia and mortality. Mice received prophylactic antibiotic therapy by using cephalexin to prevent bacterial infection from the acai pulp. T. cruzi retained its virulence in 0.15 M NaCl and agai pulp at 44 +/- 0.1 degrees C for 10 min and at 43 +/- 0.1 degrees C for 20 min, respectively, causing ACD and death in mice up to 24 days after infection. Incubation of agai pulp inoculum above 43 degrees C for 20 min neutralized T. cruzi virulence, thereby preventing ACD and death in murine recipients. The heating of agai pulp above 43 degrees C for 20 min is a practical and effective measure to prevent foodborne ACD caused by T. cruzi.

AB  - Chagas disease is a major public health issue, affecting similar to 10 million people worldwide. Transmitted by a protozoan named Trypanosoma cruzi, this infection triggers a chronic inflammatory process that can lead to cardiomyopathy (Chagas disease). Resolvin D1 (RvD1) is a novel proresolution lipid mediator whose effects on inflammatory diseases dampens pathological inflammatory responses and can restore tissue homeostasis. Current therapies are not effective in altering the outcome of T. cruzi infection, and as RvD1 has been evaluated as a therapeutic agent in various inflammatory diseases, we examined if exogenous RvD1 could modulate the pathogenesis of Chagas disease in a murine model. CD-1 mice infected with the T. cruzi Brazil strain were treated with RvD1. Mice were administered 3 mu g/kg of body weight RvD1 intraperitoneally on days 5, 10, and 15 to examine the effect of RvD1 on acute disease or administered the same dose on days 60, 65, and 70 to examine its effects on chronic infection. RvD1 therapy increased the survival rate and controlled parasite replication in mice with acute infection and reduced the levels of interferon gamma and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in mice with chronic infection. In addition, there was an increase in interleukin-10 levels with RvD1 therapy in both mice with acute infection and mice with chronic infection and a decrease in TGF-beta levels and collagen content in cardiac tissue. Together, these data indicate that RvD1 therapy can dampen the inflammatory response, promote the resolution of T. cruzi infection, and prevent cardiac fibrosis.

AB  - Rhodnius montenegrensis was described in 2012. Since then, reports of the occurrence of this species associated with palm trees near households in Rondonia have been published. This study aimed to analyze the natural infection of R. montenegrensis with trypanosomatids in the municipality of Monte Negro, Rondonia, Brazilian western Amazon. Capture of triatomines occurred in Attalea speciosa (babassu) specimens around households. Twelve of the 72 captured triatomines were identified by morphological and morphometric characters, by molecular analysis made using the PCR, DNA sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses. The intestinal content was collected from 60 of these 72 specimens. The positivity for trypanosomatids was confirmed by examining the intestinal content followed by PCR amplification of the cathepsin L-like gene specific for Trypanosoma cruzi (PCR-DTcrCatL) and Trypanosoma rangeli (PCR-DTraCatL). Of the 60 specimens analyzed by microscopy, 22 (36.7%) were positive for trypanosomatids in the intestinal content analysis. Of these 22 specimens of R. montenegrensis, 16 (72.7%) were infected with T. cruzi, 2 (9.1%) were infected with T. rangeli, 2 (9.1%) had mixed infection with T. cruzi and T. rangeli, and 2 were negative (9.1%). These data suggest the need for attention of the health surveillance system of Chagas disease in the State of Rondonia, as this study points out to another potential vector of the disease.

AB  - Objective The aim of the present research was to evaluate the correlation of vertically transmitted IgG antibodies induced by T. cruzi and newborn early outcome assessment, mainly birth weight and gestational age. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study with 183 pregnant women (64 with asymptomatic Chagas disease) and their newborns. Both were subjected to complete clinical examination. Peripheral parasitemia was assessed in mother and neonates by parasite detection through microscopic examination of the buffycoat from mother's peripheral and cord blood. Antibodies induced by T. cruzi, such as anti-FRA, anti-B13, anti-p2 beta and anti-T. cruzi were assessed by immunoassay. Birth weight, general condition evaluation by APGAR Score and gestational age by Capurro Score, were determined in newborns. Results The rate of stillbirth background and pregnancy-induced hypertension were higher in patients with Chagas disease (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). Parasitemia was detectable in 17 mothers and 4 newborns. The newborns of mothers with detectable parasitemia presented decreased gestational age (p = 0.006) and body weight (p = 0.04). Mostly all the mothers with Chagas disease and all their newborns have positive values of antibodies induced by T. cruzi; however, only anti-p2 beta showed to be related to the presence of complication during pregnancy (OR 2.35, p = 0.036), and to low birth weight (OR 1.55, p = 0.02). Conclusions Low birth weight and decreased postnatal estimation of maturity were related to detectable parasitemia in the mother. Also, vertical transmission of T. cruzi-induced autoantibodies might have clinical implication in newborns given the negative association between anti-p2 beta values and weight.

AB  - Armadillos are specialist diggers and their burrows are used to find food, seek shelter and protect their pups. These burrows can also be shared with dozens of vertebrate and invertebrate species and; consequently, their parasites including the zoonotics. The aim of this study was to diagnose the presence of zoonotic parasites in four wild-caught armadillo species from two different Brazilian ecosystems, the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna) and the Pantanal (wetland). The investigated parasites and their correspondent diseases were:Toxoplasma gondii(toxoplasmosis),Trypanosoma cruzi(Chagas disease),Leishmaniaspp., (leishmaniasis),Paracoccidioides brasiliensis(Paracoccidioidomicosis) andMycobacterium leprae(Hansen's disease). Forty-three free-living armadillos from Pantanal and seven road-killed armadillos from the Cerrado were sampled.Trypanosoma cruziDTU TcIII were isolated from 2 out of 43 (4.65%) armadillos, including one of them also infected withTrypanosoma rangeli. Antibodies anti-T. gondiiwere detected in 13 out of 43 (30.2%) armadillos. All seven armadillos from Cerrado tested positive forP. brasiliensisDNA, in the lungs, spleen, liver fragments. Also, by molecular analysis, all 43 individuals were negative forM. lepraeandLeishmaniaspp. Armadillos were infected byT. cruzi,T. rangeli, P. brasiliensisand presented seric antibodies toT. gondii,highlighting the importance of those armadillos could have in the epidemiology of zoonotic parasites.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is considered to be a multifactorial disease associated with host and parasite genetics, which influence clinical aspects of the disease and other host conditions. In order to understand better the evolution of the disease, this study intended to evaluation of parasite and host genetics in two generations of a family with Chagas disease from the Alto Paranaiba region, Minas Gerais, Brazil, comprising a mother and her five daughters. Several features were evaluated, including the characterization of T. cruzi directly from the blood of patients, host polymorphisms of genes related to cardiomyopathy (TNF, WISP1, CCR5, and TGF-beta 1) and clinical aspects of the patients. To verify the intraspecific variability of the parasite, the characterization was done directly from human blood using the PCR-LSSP technique and analyzed based on Dice coefficient and unweighted pair group analysis (UPGMA). The host polymorphism was evaluated by PCR-RFLP. The global results showed low variability of the parasites characterized from blood of patients, through Shannon index (0.492) and mean heterozygosity value per locus (0.322). All six patients presented the same genetic polymorphism profile for TNF, WISP1, and TGF-beta 1, and only one patient was homozygous to CCR5, which suggests that there is no association between the clinical aspects of the patients and their genetic profiles. In conclusion, the findings confirm that the understanding of the clinical evolution of Chagas disease goes beyond the genetic aspects of the parasite and the host.

AB  - Background. Chagas disease is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is endemic from Latin American countries. The goal of our study was to identify novel genetic loci associated with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy development in Chagas disease patients from different Latin American populations.
   Methods. We performed a cross-sectional, nested case-control study including 3 sample collections from Colombia, Argentina, and Bolivia. Samples were genotyped to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS). These results were meta-analyzed with summary statistic data from Brazil, gathering a total of 3413 Chagas disease patients. To identify the functional impact of the associated variant and its proxies, we performed an in silico analysis of this region.
   Results. The meta-analysis revealed a novel genome-wide statistically significant association with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy development in rs2458298 (OR=0.90, 95%CI=0.87-0.94, P-value=3.27x10(-08)), nearby the SAC3D1 gene. In addition, further in silico analyses displayed functional relationships between the associated variant and the SNX15, BAFT2, and FERMT3 genes, related to cardiovascular traits.
   Conclusions. Our findings support the role of the host genetic factors in the susceptibility to the development of the chronic cardiac form of this neglected disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND Vector transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi appears to be interrupted in Chile; however, data show increasing incidence of Chagas' disease, raising concerns that there may be a reemerging problem.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate the actual risk in a changing world it is necessary to consider the historical vector distribution and correlate this distribution with the presence of cases and climate change.
   METHODS Potential distribution models of Triatoma infestans and Chagas disease were performed using Maxent, a machine-learning method.
   FINDINGS Climate change appears to play a major role in the reemergence of Chagas' disease and T. infestans in Chile. The distribution of both T. infestans and Chagas' disease correlated with maximum temperature, and the precipitation during the driest month. The overlap of Chagas' disease and T. infestans distribution areas was high. The distribution of T. infestans, under two global change scenarios, showed a minimal reduction tendency in suitable areas.
   MAIN CONCLUSION The impact of temperature and precipitation on the distribution of T. infestans, as shown by the models, indicates the need for aggressive control efforts; the current control measures, including T. infestans control campaigns, should be maintained with the same intensity as they have at present, avoiding sylvatic foci, intrusions, and recolonisation of human dwellings.

AB  - Objective: Trypanosoma cruzi is subdivided into six discrete typing units (DTUs), TcI-TcVI. The precise identification of each can contribute to tracking wild DTUs that invade the domiciliary environment.
   Methods: Twenty T. cruzi stocks isolated from 16 chagasic patients, two Panstrongylus lutzi, one Galea spixii, and one Euphractus sexcinctus, from different localities in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, were characterized by genotyping the 3' region of the 24S alpha rRNA gene, the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 gene, and the spliced leader intergenic region.
   Results: TcIII was identified in 18.7% (3/16) of patients from different municipalities, as well as in P. lutzi, G. spixii, and E. sexcinctus, indicating the connection between the sylvatic and domestic cycles in this Brazilian semi-arid region. TcI and TcII were also detected, in 37.5% (6/16) and 43.8% (7/16) of patients, respectively. These DTUs were associated with cardiac, digestive, and indeterminate clinical forms, while TcIII was identified only in patients with the indeterminate form.
   Conclusions: The occurrence of these DTUs reveals important phylogenetic diversity in T. cruzi isolates from humans. TcIII is reported for the first time in northeastern Brazil.

AB  - The reactivation of Chagas disease in HIV infected patients presents high mortality and morbidity. We present the case of a female patient with confirmed Chagasic meningoencephalitis as AIDS-defining illness. Interestingly, her TCD4+ lymphocyte cell count was 318 cells/mm(3). After two months of induction therapy, one year of maintenance with benznidazol, and early introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the patient had good clinical, parasitological and radiological evolution. We used a qualitative polymerase chain reaction for the monitoring of T. cruzi parasitemia during and after the treatment. We emphasize the potential value of molecular techniques along with clinical and radiological parameters in the follow-up of patients with Chagas disease and HIV infection. Early introduction of HAART, prolonged induction and maintenance of antiparasitic therapy, and its discontinuation are feasible, in the current management of reactivation of Chagas disease.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by triatomine vectors. The northeastern region of Brazil is endemic for Chagas disease and has the largest diversity of triatomine species. T. cruzi development in its triatomine vector depends on diverse factors, including the composition of bacterial gut microbiota.
   Methods: We characterized the triatomines captured in the municipality of Russas (Ceara) by sequencing the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. The composition of the bacterial community in the gut of peridomestic Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma pseudomaculata was investigated using culture independent methods based on the amplification of the 16S rRNA gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), DNA fragment cloning, Sanger sequencing and 454 pyrosequencing. Additionally, we identified TcI and TcII types of T. cruzi by sequencing amplicons from the gut metagenomic DNA with primers for the mini-exon gene.
   Results: Triatomines collected in the peridomestic ecotopes were diagnosed as T. pseudomaculata and T. brasiliensis by comparing their COI sequence with GenBank. The rate of infection by T. cruzi in adult triatomines reached 80% for T. pseudomaculata and 90% for T. brasiliensis. According to the DNA sequences from the DGGE bands, the triatomine gut microbiota was primarily composed of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. However, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were also detected, although in much lower proportions. Serratia was the main genus, as it was encountered in all samples analyzed by DGGE and 454 pyrosequencing. Members of Corynebacterinae, a suborder of the Actinomycetales, formed the next most important group. The cloning and sequencing of full-length 16S rRNA genes confirmed the presence of Serratia marcescens, Dietzia sp., Gordonia terrae, Corynebacterium stationis and Corynebacterium glutamicum.
   Conclusions: The study of the bacterial microbiota in the triatomine gut has gained increased attention because of the possible role it may play in the epidemiology of Chagas disease by competing with T. cruzi. Culture independent methods have shown that the bacterial composition of the microbiota in the guts of peridomestic triatomines is made up by only few bacterial species.

AB  - Introduction: The National Park of Serra das Confusoes (NPSC) is a protected area of natural landscape located in Southern Piaui, Brazil, and it is considered as one of the largest and most important protected areas in the Caatinga biome. Methods: The natural occurrences of trypanosomatids from hemocultures on small mammals and cultures from intestinal contents triatomines were detected through molecular diagnoses of blood samples. and phylogenetic relationship analysis of the isolates parasites using the trypanosome barcode (V7V8 SSUrDNA) were realized. Results: Only two Galea spixii (8.1%) and six Triatoma brasiliensis (17.6%) were positive by hemoculture, and the isolates parasites were cryopreseived. All the isolates obtained were positioned on the Trypanosoma cruzi DTU TcI branch. Conclusions: Research focused on studying the wild animal fauna in preserved and underexplored environments has made it possible to elucidate indispensable components of different epidemiological chains of diseases with zoonotic potential.

AB  - Background: Neotropical primates are important sylvatic hosts of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Infection is often subclinical, but severe disease has been described in both free-ranging and captive primates. Panstrongylus megistus, a major T. cruzi vector, was found infesting a small-primate unit at Brasilia zoo (ZooB), Brazil. ZooB lies close to a gallery-forest patch where T. cruzi circulates naturally. Here, we combine parasitological and molecular methods to investigate a focus of T. cruzi infection involving triatomine bugs and Neotropical primates at a zoo located in the Brazilian Savannah.
   Methods: We assessed T. cruzi infection in vectors using optical microscopy (n = 34) and nested PCR (n = 50). We used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to examine blood samples from 26 primates and necropsy samples from two primates that died during the study. We determined parasite lineages in five vectors and two primates by comparing glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6pi) gene sequences.
   Results: Trypanosoma cruzi was found in 44 vectors and 17 primates (six genera and eight species); one Mico chrysoleucus and one Saguinus niger had high parasitaemias. Trypanosoma cruzi DNA was detected in three primates born to qPCR-negative mothers at ZooB and in the two dead specimens. One Callithrix geoffroyi became qPCR-positive over a two-year follow-up. All G6pi sequences matched T. cruzi lineage Td.
   Conclusions: Our findings strongly suggest vector-borne T. cruzi transmission within a small-primate unit at ZooB - with vectors, and perhaps also parasites, presumably coming from nearby gallery forest. Periodic checks for vectors and parasites would help eliminate T. cruzi transmission foci in captive-animal facilities. This should be of special importance for captive-breeding programs involving endangered mammals, and would reduce the risk of accidental T. cruzi transmission to keepers and veterinarians.

AB  - Shelters are places that receive certain species of domestic animals, mostly dogs and cats, that are normally abandoned. These animals are easy to handle because they are crowded and have limited movement. Dogs, due to the close relationship with humans, are considered the main domestic reservoirs in the peridomiciliary cycle of American trypanosomiasis infection in humans. Therefore, in several countries studies are carried out to assess the occurrence of infection in these animals. This work evaluated the occurrence of Trypanosoma cruzi in dogs from shelters in the city of Aracaju, Sergipe. This was an observational and cross-sectional study to detect the occurrence of T. cruzi in blood samples from shelter dogs using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the TcZ1/TcZ2 primers. A total of 168 blood samples from dogs (104 females and 64 males) were collected and subjected to DNA and PCR extraction, and seventeen (10.1%) samples showed amplification of the product of the expected size. The TcZ1/TcZ2 primer pair used is considered specific for T. cruzi, and it is capable of amplifying all strains without amplifying other Trypanosoma species. The shelters evaluated had different physical infrastructure; animals positive for T. cruzi were found in all of them, as confirmed by sequencing. It is concluded that shelter dogs, as well as other domestic animals, can function as indicators of the occurrence of T. cruzi in Aracaju-SE, providing relevant epidemiological information for health surveillance and monitoring of Trypanosomatid infections.

AB  - Trypanosoma and Leishmania are obligate parasites that cause important diseases in human and domestic animals. Wild mammals are the natural reservoirs of these parasites, which are transmitted by hematophagous arthropods. The present study aimed to detect the natural occurrence of trypanosomatids through serological diagnosis, PCR of whole blood and blood culture (hemoculture), and phylogenetic relationships using small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA), cytochrome b, and glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) genes. Samples from 131 wild animals, including rodents, marsupials, and bats, were sampled in six areas in the state of MaranhAo, in a transition zone of semiarid climates northeast of the equatorial humid Amazon. Serological analysis for Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi was performed in opossums by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), and all animals were serologically negative. Nine positive hemocultures (6.77%) were isolated and cryopreserved and from mammals of the Didelphimorphia and Chiroptera orders and positioned in phylogenies on the basis of sequences from different genes with reference strains of Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei and T. cruzi. From primary samples (blood and tissues) only one bat, Pteronotus parnellii, was positive to SSU rDNA and gGAPDH genes and grouped with the L. infantum chagasi branch. The studies conducted in MaranhAo State provide knowledge of parasite diversity. It is important to determine the presence of trypanosomatids in wild mammals with synanthropic habits.

AB  - Introduction: This study evaluated the clinical forms and manifestation severities of Chagas disease among serologically reactive individuals from Western Rio Grande do Norte (Northeastern Brazil). Methods: This cross-sectional study included 186 adults who were evaluated using electrocardiography, echocardiography, chest radiography, and contrast radiography of the esophagus and colon. A clinical-epidemiological questionnaire was also used. Results: The indeterminate, cardiac, digestive, and cardiodigestive clinical forms of Chagas disease were diagnosed in 51.6% (96/186), 32.2% (60/186), 8.1% (15/186) and 8.1% (15/186) of the participants, respectively. Heart failure (functional classes I-IV) was detected in 7.5% (14/186) of the participants, and 36.4% (24/66), 30.3% (20/66), 15.2% (10/66), 13.6% (9/66), and 4.5% (3/66) of the patients were at stage A, B1, B2, C, and D, respectively. Dilated cardiomyopathy and electrocardiographic changes were detected in 10.2% (19/186) and 48.1% (91/186) of the participants, respectively. Apical aneurysm was diagnosed in 10.8% (20/186) of the participants, and other changes in the segmental myocardial contractility of the left ventricle were diagnosed in 33.9% (63/186) of the participants. Megaesophagus (groups I-IV) was observed in 7% (13/186) of the participants, megacolon (grades 1-3) was detected in12.9% (24/186) of the participants, and both organs were affected in 29.2% (7/24) of the megacolon cases. Conclusions: We detected various clinical forms of Chagas disease (including the digestive form). Our findings indicate that clinical symptoms alone may not be sufficient to exclude or confirm cardiac and/or digestive damage, and the number of patients with symptomatic clinical forms may be underestimated.

AB  - Nitroimidazoles are pharmacophoric groups responsible for important antiparasitic activity against several infectious diseases. 2-Nitroimidazoles are found in some antiparasitic drugs and are one of the main moieties responsible for the biological activities exhibited. As an example, we can mention the drug benznidazole, the only drug available in Brazil for the treatment of Chagas disease. This work describes an efficient methodology for the synthesis of 2-nitro-1-vinyl-1H-imidazole through a simple and direct approach, as well as its full characterization and biological assessment. The antiparasitic evaluation of 2-nitro-1-vinyl-1H-imidazole against Trypanosoma cruzi (Tulahuen C2C4-LacZ strain) showed IC50 = 4.8 mu M on amastigotes and low cytotoxicity against LLC-MK2 cells (IC50 > 500 mu M), validating 2-nitro-1-vinyl-1H-imidazole as a biologically active structural subunit for anti-T. cruzi activity. The results presented herein demonstrate that 2-nitro-1-vinyl-1H-imidazole can be easily obtained, possessing great potential for use in the design of new antichagasic drugs through a molecular hybridization strategy using known coupling reactions.

AB  - Background: Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease in humans, has a vast reservoir of mammalian hosts in the Americas, and is classified into six genetic lineages, TcI-TcVI, with a possible seventh, TcBat. Elucidating enzootic cycles of the different lineages is important for understanding the ecology of this parasite, the emergence of new outbreaks of Chagas disease and for guiding control strategies. Direct lineage identification by genotyping is hampered by limitations of parasite isolation and culture. An indirect method is to identify lineage-specific serological reactions in infected individuals; here we describe its application with sylvatic Brazilian primates.
   Methods: Synthetic peptides representing lineage-specific epitopes of the T. cruzi surface protein TSSA were used in ELISA with sera from Atlantic Forest Leontopithecus chrysomelas (golden-headed lion tamarin), L. rosalia (golden lion tamarin), Amazonian Sapajus libidinosus (black-striped capuchin) and Alouatta belzebul (red-handed howler monkey).
   Results: The epitope common to lineages TcII, TcV and TcVI was recognised by sera from 15 of 26 L. chrysomelas and 8 of 13 L. rosalia. For 12 of these serologically identified TcII infections, the identity of the lineage infection was confirmed by genotyping T. cruzi isolates. Of the TcII/TcV/TcVI positive sera 12 of the 15 L. chrysomelas and 2 of the 8 L. rosalia also reacted with the specific epitope restricted to TcV and TcVI. Sera from one of six S. libidinous recognised the TcIV/TcIII epitopes.
   Conclusions: This lineage-specific serological surveillance has verified that Atlantic Forest primates are reservoir hosts of at least TcII, and probably TcV and TcVI, commonly associated with severe Chagas disease in the southern cone region of South America. With appropriate reagents, this novel methodology is readily applicable to a wide range of mammal species and reservoir host discovery.

AB  - The aim of this study was to reevaluate the ecology of an area in the Atlantic Forest, southeast Brazil, where Chagas disease (CD) has been found to occur. In a previous study, immediately after the occurrence of a CD case, we did not observe any sylvatic small mammals or dogs with Trypanosoma cruzi cruzi infections, but Triatoma vitticeps presented high T. c. cruzi infection rates. In this study, we investigated bats together with non-volant mammals, dogs, and triatomines to explore other possible T. c. cruzi reservoirs/hosts in the area. Seventy-three non-volant mammals and 186 bats were captured at three sites within the Guarapari municipality, Espirito Santo state. Rio da Prata and Amarelos sites exhibited greater richness in terms of non-volant mammals and bats species, respectively. The marsupial Metachirus nudicaudatus, the rodent Trinomys paratus, and the bats Artibeus lituratus and Carollia perspicillata were the most frequently captured species. As determined by positive hemocultures, only two non-volant mammals were found to be infected by Trypanosoma species: Monodelphis americana, which was infected by T. cascaveffi, T. dionisii and Trypanosoma sp., and Caffithrix geoffroyi, which was infected by T. minasense. Bats presented T. c. cruziTcl and TcIII/V, T. c. marinkellei, T. dionisii, T. rangeli B and D, and Trypanosoma sp. infections. Seven dogs were infected with T. cruzi based only on serological exams. The triatomines T. vitticeps and Panstrongylus geniculatus were found to be infected by trypanosomes via microscopy. According to molecular characterization, T. vitticeps specimens were infected with T. c. cruziTcl, Tcl I, TcIII/V, and TcIV, T. c. marinkellei and T. dionisii. We observed high trypanosome diversity in a small and fragmented region of the Atlantic Forest. This diversity was primarily maintained by bats and T. vitticeps. Our findings show that the host specificity of the Trypanosoma genus should be thoroughly reviewed. In addition, our data show that CD cases can occur without an enzootic cycle near residential areas.

AB  - The cross-reaction in the diagnosis results is a serious problem, leading to an incorrect treatment and several injuries to patients. The Trypanosoma rangeli and Trypanosoma cruzi belong to the genus Trypanosoma, but the Trypanosoma rangeli is a non-pathogenic parasite to humans. While Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas' disease, which affects circa 2-3 million people and more than 6000 deaths annually in Brazil. The Leishmania chagasi causes infectious disease known as visceral leishmaniasis. This diseases have in common the crossed antigenic reaction promoted by serological tests and its differentiation is relevant for epidemiological studies and clinical practice. In this study the Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy was used to differentiate these microorganisms, which were cultivated and the spectra analyzed. Data analysis were performed by Gaussian curve fitting and multivariate statistical analysis. The cluster analysis have shown four specific regions to identify the microorganisms. The first three PCs of principal component analysis associated to linear discriminant were able to classify 95.6% of the parasites using cross-validation. The curve fitting method showed the quantitative differentiation among L. chagasi, T. cruzi, and T. rangeli species in the vibrational regions of polysaccharides, amide III, lipid esters, and fatty acid.

AB  - Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease and results in myocardial inflammation and cardiomyopathy. Downregulated Hexim1 expression, as in Hexim1(+/-) mice, reduces cardiac inflammation and fibrosis following ischemic stress. We asked whether reduced expression of Hexim1 would also afford protection against T. cruzi-induced cardiomyopathy. C57BL/6J (wild type - WT) and Hexim1(+/-) mice were infected with sub-lethal doses of T. cruzi (Brazil strain), and cardiac function, serologic markers of inflammation and tissue pathology were examined. Infected Hexim1(+/-) mice had compromised cardiac function, altered expression of both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and increased inflammation and fibrosis. Cardiac failure was evidenced by severely diminished heart rate, compensatory increase in respiratory rate, and abnormally high left ventricular mass with severe transmural inflammation. Lungs displayed intense peribronchial inflammation and fibrosis extending into the parenchyma. We also observed Smad3-serine(208) phosphorylation in hearts and lungs of infected mice, suggesting increased TGF-beta signaling pathway activity. This was more pronounced in Hexim1(+/-) mice and correlated with increased fibrosis in these tissues. Conspicuous splenomegaly in the Hexim1(+/-) mice most likely resulted from the observed extensive white pulp expansion. T. cruzi infection induced colonic dilatation and marked villous atrophy in both the WT and Hexim1(+/-) mice but more so in the latter. The profound exacerbation of pathologic findings suggests a protective role for Hexim1 in T. cruzi infection. (c) 2017 Institut Pasteur. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chagas disease was described more than a century ago and, despite great efforts to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to cardiac and digestive manifestations in chronic patients, much remains to be clarified. The disease is found beyond Latin America, including Japan, the USA, France, Spain, and Australia, and is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Dr. Carlos Chagas described Chagas disease in 1909 in Brazil, and hepatomegaly was among the clinical signs observed. Currently, hepatomegaly is cited in most papers published which either study acutely infected patients or experimental models, and we know that the parasite can infect multiple cell types in the liver, especially Kupffer cells and dendritic cells. Moreover, liver damage is more pronounced in cases of oral infection, which is mainly found in the Amazon region. However, the importance of liver involvement, including the hepatic immune response, in disease progression does not receive much attention. In this review, we present the very first paper published approaching the liver's participation in the infection, as well as subsequent papers published in the last century, up to and including our recently published results. We propose that, after infection, activated peripheral T lymphocytes reach the liver and induce a shift to a pro-inflammatory ambient environment. Thus, there is an immunological integration and cooperation between peripheral and hepatic immunity, contributing to disease control.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatidae) infects all tissues of its hosts, which along with humans, include hundreds of mammalian species in the Americas. The epidemiology of T. cruzi has been changing in that currently the majority of the cases and/or outbreaks of Chagas disease occur by the ingestion of comestibles contaminated by T. cruzi metacyclic forms. These cases/outbreaks occur in distinct regional scenarios, mainly in the Amazon biome and are related to the local interaction mode of humans with their surroundings, as well as with the overall local ecological peculiarities. As trypanosomiasis caused by T. cruzi is primarily a zoonosis, understanding the variables that influences its transmission in the wild as well as the role played by the extant fauna in the maintenance of the parasite, is critical in establishing control measures. Here, we present the results of our studies of T. cruzi infection of free ranging wild mammalian fauna in the five biomes of Brazil, a country of continental dimensions. From 1992 up to 2017, we examined a total of 6587 free-ranging non-volant wild mammal specimens. Our studies found that 17% of mammals were seropositive and 8% of all animals displayed positive hemocultures indicative of high parasitemia and, consequently, of infectivity potential. We observed that opossums, mainly Philander spp. and Didelphis spp., the coati Nasua nasua, the capuchin monkey Sapajus libidinosus and the golden lion tamarin Leontopithecus rosalia, were mammal taxa that demonstrated higher rates of positive hemocultures. Additionally, Didelphis spp. demonstrated to be a competent bioaccumulator of TcI diversity. Chiroptera were distinguished for hosting the greatest diversity of species and genotypes of Trypanosoma spp. Additionally the observation of the higher host range of some Trypanosoma spp., shows the need to reassess the ecology of representatives of the taxon. Altogether, our results showed that each locality, may display distinct enzootiological and epidemiological scenarios that must be taken into account when it comes to establishing control and/or clarification campaigns of the local population.

AB  - This study aimed to identify the Trypanosoma cruzi genotypes and their relationship with parasitic load in distinct geographic and ecotypic populations of Triatoma brasiliensis in two sites, including one where a Chagas disease (ChD) outbreak occurred in Rio Grande do Norte state, Brazil. Triatomine captures were performed in peridomestic and sylvatic ecotopes in two municipalities: Marcelino Vieira - affected by the outbreak; and Currais Novos - where high pressure of peridomestic triatomine infestation after insecticide spraying have been reported. The kDNA-PCR was used to select 124 T. cruzi positive triatomine samples, of which 117 were successfully genotyped by fluorescent fragment length barcoding (FFLB). Moreover, the T. cruzi load quantification was performed using a multiplex TaqMan qPCR. Our findings showed a clear ecotypic segregation between TcI and TcII harboured by T. brasiliensis (p<0.001). Although no genotypes were ecotypically exclusive, TcI was predominant in peridomestic ecotopes (86%). In general, T. brasiliensis from Rio Grande do Norte had a higher T. cruzi load varying from 3.94 to 7.66 x 106 T. cruzi per insect. Additionally, TcII (median value=299,504 T. cruzi/intestine unit equivalents) had more than twice (p=0.1) the parasite load of TcI (median value=149,077 T. cruzi/intestine unit equivalents), which can be attributed to a more ancient co-evolution with T. brasiliensis. The higher prevalence of TcII in the sylvatic T. brasiliensis (70%) could be associated with a more diversified source of bloodmeals for wild insect populations. Either TcI or TcII may have been responsible for the ChD outbreak that occurred in the city of Marcelino Vieira. On the other hand, a smaller portion of T. brasiliensis was infected by TcIII (3%) in the peridomicile, in addition to T. rangeli genotype A (1%), often found in mixed infections. Our results highlight the need of understanding the patterns of T. cruzi genotype ' s development and circulation in insect vectors and reservoirs as a mode of tracking situations of epidemiologic importance, as the ChD outbreak recently recorded for Northeastern Brazil.

AB  - Background: Chagas Disease (CD) is a parasitic anthropozoonosis caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi (1. cruzi), a protozoan transmitted by insects from the Reduviidae family. Several species of wild and domestic animals, humans included, are susceptible, developing acute clinical signals (myocarditis and cardiac arrhythmias) or chronic signals (drop on the performance and syncope) of the disease. In Brazil, the disease in dogs shows variable indexes of occurrence. The present paper describes the natural infection by T. cruzi in a canine living in the city of Barra, in the state of Bahia, Brazil, a region classified as high risk of vulnerability for the CD in the northeast of Brazil.
   Case: A 9-year-old male dog, non-specific breed, was referred to the clinic the Veterinary Clinic for Small Animals, at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital), at the Federal University of the West of Bahia. Its owner reported the presence of bloody secretion in the penile region. During the physical exam it was possible to observe an increase in the volume of the penis base. All of the animal's physiological parameters were within normal levels. Blood samples and cytological laminas from the lesioned area were collected and sent to the Laboratory of Veterinary Clinical Pathology in the same institution. The cytological exam showed monomorphic population of great round cells with a round nucleus, condensed chromatin and one to two prominent nucleolus, abundant and slightly basophilic cytoplasm, with multiple stippled vacuoles, thus confirming a Transmissible venereal tumor (TVT) case. With the blood exam one observed a thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia with a deviation on the left and the presence of a trypomastigote form of Trypanosoma sp. in the blood smears. A complete blood sample was sent to the Laboratory of Pathology and Molecular Biology from the Fiocruz-BA (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in the State of Bahia), being identified by the PCR technique, T. cruzi.
   Discussion: During the complete blood count, specifically using the blood smear, the microscopic visualization of the trypomastigote form of the Trypanosoma sp., a hemoparasite of filiform aspect, with undulating membrane over the whole body and free flagellum, confirming a case of trypanosomiasis. Such diagnostics had not been considered up to this moment, as the animal did not present any clinic symptomatology that indicated the pathological condition. The high levels of parasitemia presented by the animal, confirmed by the presence of the protozoan in the blood smear, probably indicate the acute phase of the infection, period in which the multiplication and development of the agent is higher, consequently allowing the visualization of the hemoparasite in the lamina. Although the TVT had proved to be the main derogatory factor of sanity and wellbeing of the animal, one calls the attention in this case for the trypanosomiasis, a zoonosis that causes great risk to the sole health, highlighting that the canine species is taken as an important reservoir of T. cruzi, relevant for the maintenance and interaction among the domestic and wild cycles of the Chagas Disease. This is the first report of a canine naturally infected by T. cruzi in the west Region of the State of Bahia. It is, thus, important to emphasize its significance once dogs can be reservoirs of the protozoan, acting in their life cycle and epidemiological chain of the Chagas Disease, enabling the infection of triatomines and humans. Future studies should be done with the purpose of determining the predominance of the agent in the region of the city of Barra, in the State of Bahia.

AB  - BackgroundInfection with Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan parasite that causes Chagas disease, results in chronic infection that leads to cardiomyopathy with increased mortality and morbidity in endemic regions. In a companion study, our group found that a high-fat diet (HFD) protected mice from T.cruzi-induced myocardial damage and significantly reduced post-infection mortality during acute T.cruzi infection.
   MethodsIn the present study metabolic syndrome was induced prior to T. cruzi infection by feeding a high fat diet. Also, mice were treated with anti-diabetic drug metformin.
   ResultsIn the present study, the lethality of T.cruzi (Brazil strain) infection in CD-1 mice was reduced from 55% to 20% by an 8-week pre-feeding of an HFD to induce obesity and metabolic syndrome. The addition of metformin reduced mortality to 3%.
   ConclusionsIt is an interesting observation that both the high fat diet and the metformin, which are known to differentially attenuate host metabolism, effectively modified mortality in T.cruzi-infected mice. In humans, the metabolic syndrome, as presently construed, produces immune activation and metabolic alterations that promote complications of obesity and diseases of later life, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and cancer. Using an evolutionary approach, we hypothesized that for millions of years, the channeling of host resources into immune defences starting early in life ameliorated the effects of infectious diseases, especially chronic infections, such as tuberculosis and Chagas disease. In economically developed countries in recent times, with control of the common devastating infections, epidemic obesity and lengthening of lifespan, the dwindling benefits of the immune activation in the first half of life have been overshadowed by the explosion of the syndrome's negative effects in later life.

AB  - Background: After the control of the main modes of Chagas disease (CD) transmission in most endemic countries, it is important to identify the participation of native sylvatic vectors in CD transmission. Although CD is not considered endemic in Rio de Janeiro State (RJ), Brazil, we identified patients with CD born in RJ and investigated the possible autochthonous transmission in the state.
   Methods: Patients born in RJ and followed in our institution between 1986 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. The cases identified as autochthonous transmission were submitted to epidemiological, clinical, serological, parasitological and molecular studies. Sectional field study with serological survey, research of sylvatic reservoirs and vectors was conducted in rural areas where patients were born.
   Results: Among 1963 patients, 69 (3.5%) were born in RJ. From these, 15 (21.7%) were considered to have acquired the infection by autochthonous transmission. Cardiac form was the commonest form of presentation (60%). In rural areas in RJ northern region, sylvatic cycles of Trypanosoma cruzi and domestic invasion by Triatoma vitticeps were identified, and CD prevalence among inhabitants was 0.74%. TcI genotype was identified in sylvatic reservoirs and vectors. The genotype (mixed infection Tcl/TcVI) could be identified in one of the autochthonous cases.
   Conclusions: The autochthonous vectorial transmission of CD occurs in RJ, probably due to wild cycles of T. cruzi and sylvatic vectors, such as T. vitticeps. Therefore, the health authorities should evaluate if RJ should be included in the original endemic area of CD and CD should be included in the diagnostic work out of cardiomyopathy of patients born in RJ. Moreover, control and educational measures should be put into place in the risk areas.

AB  - The present study aimed to identify the triatomine species and evaluate Trypanosoma cruzi infection in insects captured in endemic areas of Para State, Brazil. Triatomines were captured in nine rural communities in the municipality of Sao Domingos do Capim in August, September and December 2014 using active searches and Malaise and Noireau traps. Additionally, from 2014 to 2018, residents and community health agents submitted captured triatomines to the study team. The analysis of T. cruzi infection in the insects was performed by direct parasitological examination and nested-PCR. A total of 225 triatomines were captured and identified: Rhodnius robustus (n = 111), Rhodnius pictipes (n = 54), Panstrongylus geniculatus (n = 44), Eratyrus mucronatus (n = 11), Panstrongylus lignarius (n = 4), and Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus (n = 1). Direct parasitological examination was performed in 27 living triatomines R. robustus (n = 14), P. geniculatus (n = 7) and R. pictipes (n = 6) and metacyclic trypomastigote forms similar to those of T. cruzi were observed in 66.6% (18/27) samples. Of 174 samples analysed by nested-PCR, 81.6% were positive for T. cruzi DNA: R. robustus (84.7%; 72/85), R. pictipes (84.1%; 37/44), P. geniculatus (69.4%; 25/36), P. lignarius (100%; 4/4), E. mucronatus (75%; 3/4) and P. rufotuberculatus (100%; 1/1). R. robustus, R. pictipes and P. geniculatus were the main vectors of T. cruzi in the studied areas; however, the detection of infections in P. lignarius, E. mucronatus and P. rufotuberculatus indicated that these species can also act as potential vectors of T. cruzi in the study areas.

AB  - Background
   The influence of genetic ancestry on Trypanosoma cruzi infection and Chagas disease outcomes is unknown.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We used 370,539 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) to examine the association between individual proportions of African, European and Native American genomic ancestry with T. cruzi infection and related outcomes in 1,341 participants (aged >= 60 years) of the Bambui (Brazil) population-based cohort study of aging. Potential confounding variables included sociodemographic characteristics and an array of health measures. The prevalence of T. cruzi infection was 37.5% and 56.3% of those infected had a major ECG abnormality. Baseline T. cruzi infection was correlated with higher levels of African and Native American ancestry, which in turn were strongly associated with poor socioeconomic circumstances. Cardiomyopathy in infected persons was not significantly associated with African or Native American ancestry levels. Infected persons with a major ECG abnormality were at increased risk of 15-year mortality relative to their counterparts with no such abnormalities (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.80; 95% 1.41, 2.32). African and Native American ancestry levels had no significant effect modifying this association.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our findings indicate that African and Native American ancestry have no influence on the presence of major ECG abnormalities and had no influence on the ability of an ECG abnormality to predict mortality in older people infected with T. cruzi. In contrast, our results revealed a strong and independent association between prevalent T. cruzi infection and higher levels of African and Native American ancestry. Whether this association is a consequence of genetic background or differential exposure to infection remains to be determined.

AB  - Background: In recent decades some outbreaks of food-borne acute Chagas disease (ACD) in humans were identified by clinical and epidemiological characterization after association through the ingestion of acaf pulp probably contaminated with Trypanosoma cruzi. Whereas Belem and Abaetetuba stood out as important risk regions for disease transmission, the importance of Rhodnius pictipes, and Philander opossum for the biological cycle of T. cruzi, and data from agribusiness market of acaf, to study T. cruzi from vector and reservoir of the Brazilian Amazon region is critical for this context. Thus, the purpose of this study was to verify the infective capacity and the virulence of T. cruzi in acaf pulp from vector and reservoir at Para State experimentally.
   Methods: 10(5) T. cruzi I in in natura agai pulp from Belem at Para State, at room temperature, after forced sieving, by intraperitoneal, gavage or oral route of inoculation in B6.129S7Rag1(-/-tmMom)/J Unib allowed food-borne ACD analysis using common light microscopy.
   Principal findings: T. cruzi in in natura agai pulp from R. pictipes (Val-De-Cans Forest, Belem, and Ajuai River, Abaetetuba, Para), and P. opossum (Combu Island, Belem, Para) caused ACD and death between 17 and 52 days after experimental infections in murine immunodeficient hosts.
   Conclusions: T. cruzi from different sources and locations at Para State in in natura acaf\ pulp retained its infective capacity and virulence, and can cause new outbreaks of ACD by oral transmission. Additionally, quality basic education will facilitate efficient hygiene practices throughout the acaf productive chain can eradicate food-borne ACD in the coming decades.

AB  - Background: Trypanosoma cruzi infection via oral route results in outbreaks or cases of acute Chagas disease (ACD) in different Brazilian regions and poses a novel epidemiological scenario. In the Espirito Santo state (southeastern Brazil), a fatal case of a patient with ACD led us to investigate the enzootic scenario to avoid the development of new cases. At the studied locality, Triatoma vitticeps exhibited high T. cruzi infection rates and frequently invaded residences.
   Methods: Sylvatic and domestic mammals in the Rio da Prata locality, where the ACD case occurred, and in four surrounding areas (Baia Nova, Buenos Aires, Santa Rita and Todos os Santos) were examined and underwent parasitological and serological tests. Triatomines were collected for a fecal material exam, culturing and mini-exon gene molecular characterization, followed by RFLP-PCR of H3/Alul. Paraffin-embedded cardiac tissue of a patient was washed with xylene to remove paraffin and DNA was extracted using the phenol-chloroform method. For genotype characterization, PCR was performed to amplify the 1f8, GPI and 18S rRNA genes. In the case of V7V8 SSU rRNA, the PCR products were molecularly cloned. PCR products were sequenced and compared to sequences in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood method with 1000 bootstrap replicates was performed.
   Results: None of the animals showed positive hemocultures. Three rodents and two dogs showed signs of infection, as inferred from borderline serological titers. T. vitticeps was the only triatomine species identified and showed T. cruzi infection by DTUs TcI and TcIV. The analysis of cardiac tissue DNA showed mixed infection by T. cruzi (DTUs I, II, III and IV) and Trypanosoma dionisii.
   Conclusions: Each case or outbreak of ACD should be analyzed as a particular epidemiological occurrence. The results indicated that mixed infections in humans may play a role in pathogenicity and may be more common than is currently recognized. Direct molecular characterization from biological samples is essential because this procedure avoids parasite selection. T. dionisii may under certain and unknown circumstances infect humans. The distribution of T. cruzi DTUS TcIII and TcIV in Brazilian biomes is broader than has been assumed to date.

AB  - Background and objectives: Triatomines are invertebrate hosts of Trypanosoma cruzi, etiological agent of Chagas Disease, a parasitosis that affects mammals, including humans. Considering these insects as natural sources of infection, this study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of triatomine infestation in home environment in the Municipality of Aurora, CE between 2012 and 2015. Methods: The secondary data on catches of species and analysis of T. cruzi infection were obtained from the Chagas Disease Control Program's of Medical Entomology Laboratory Medica Zolide Mota Ribeiro in Juazeiro do Norte-CE. Results: A total of 1.176 triatomine specimens were captured, most of them found in the peridomiciliary area (85,71%), and were identified as Triatoma pseudomaculata (81,38%), T. brasiliensis (15,73%), Rhodnius nasutus (1,45%), Panstrongylus lutzi (1,28%), and Panstrongylus megistus (0,17%). Of the analyzed triatomines the majority were nymphs (64,80%), followed by adult males (17,52%) e 0,34% of them were infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. These infected insects belonged to the species Triatoma pseudomaculata (0,42%) and T. brasiliensis (0,54%), most of them in nymph stage (80%). Conclusion: The triatominal infestation index is significant in intradomicile and, especially, in the peridomicile, representing a health risk for the population of Aurora, CE, since triatomines parasitized by Trypansoma cruzi have already been diagnosed. Furthermore, the most prevalent species founded in this study are among the main vectors of Chagas disease in Cariri region, State of Ceara and Brazil.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is a parasitic infection that originated in the Americas and is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. In the last few years, the disease has spread to countries in North America, Asia and Europe due to the migration of Latin Americans. In the Brazilian Amazon, CD has an endemic transmission, especially in the Rio Negro region, where an occupational hazard was described for piacaveiros (piassaba gatherers). In the State of Amazonas, the first chagasic infection was reported in 1977, and the first acute CD case was recorded in 1980. After initiatives to integrate acute CD diagnostics with the malaria laboratories network, reports of acute CD cases have increased. Most of these cases are associated with oral transmission by the consumption of contaminated food. Chronic cases have also been diagnosed, mostly in the indeterminate form. These cases were detected by serological surveys in cardiologic outpatient clinics and during blood donor screening. Considering that the control mechanisms adopted in Brazil's classic transmission areas are not fully applicable in the Amazon, it is important to understand the disease behavior in this region, both in the acute and chronic cases. Therefore, the pursuit of control measures for the Amazon region should be a priority given that CD represents a challenge to preserving the way of life of the Amazon's inhabitants.

AB  - Background: Trypanosoma cruzi is a protozoan parasite characterized by extensive genetic heterogeneity. There are currently six recognised, genetically distinct, monophyletic clades designated discrete typing units (DTUs). TcI has the broadest geographical range and most genetic diversity evidenced by a wide range of genetic markers applied to isolates spanning a vast geographical range across Latin America. However, little is known of the diversity of TcI that exists within sylvatic mammals across the geographical expanse of Brazil.
   Results: Twenty-nine sylvatic TcI isolates spanning multiple ecologically diverse biomes across Brazil were analyzed by the application of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) using four nuclear housekeeping genes. Results revealed extensive genetic diversity and also incongruence among individual gene trees. There was no association of intralineage genotype with geography or with any particular biome, with the exception of isolates from Caatinga that formed a single cluster. However, haplotypic analyses of METIII and LYT1 constitutive markers provided evidence of recombination events in two isolates derived from Didelphis marsupialis and D. albiventris, respectively. For diversity studies all possible combinations of markers were assessed with the objective of selecting the combination of gene targets that are most resolutive using the minimum number of genes. A panel of just three gene fragments (DHFR-TS, LYT1 and METIII) discriminated 26 out of 35 genotypes.
   Conclusions: These findings showed geographical association of genotypes clustering in Caatinga but more characteristically TcI genotypes widely distributed without specific association to geographical areas or biomes. Importantly, we detected the signature of recombination events at the nuclear level evidenced by haplotypic analysis and incongruence.

AB  - Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. This disease is distributed in 21 Latin American countries, where it is mostly vector-borne. In Brazil, there are 68 triatomine species. To date, the epidemiological surveys indicate that the state of Sao Paulo presents 11 species of triatomines, and most of these species have already been collected in a home environment and found to be infected with T. cruzi. Problems in correctly identifying species can lead to incorrect panorama of distribution of Chagas disease vectors. Thus, we developed an identification key for the triatomines of the state of Sao Paulo, based on cytogenetic data. With the exception of Panstrongylus diasi that does not present cytogenetic data available in the literature, all species were differentiated by cytogenetic characteristics. We emphasize the importance of using this key as a simple and objective tool in the entoepidemiological surveys conducted by the vector control programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND Trypanosoma cruzi crosses the placental barrier and produces the congenital transmission of Chagas disease (CD). Structural alterations of the chorionic villi by this parasite have been described in vitro, but little is known about trophoblast turnover in placentas from women with CD.
   OBJECTIVE To analyze the proliferation and fusion processes in placentas from women with CD.
   METHODS Archived human term placenta paraffin-embedded blocks were used, from women with CD (CDP), and no pathology (NP). Immunohistochemistry tests were performed for Ki67 to calculate the proliferation index ( PI) of cytotrophoblast (CTB) and Syncytin-1, a fusion marker of syncytiotrophoblast (STB). Hematoxylin/Eosin stained sections were employed to analyze STB percentages, STB detachment areas and syncytial knots quantity. Non parametric Student's t-tests were performed (p < 0.05).
   RESULTS Syncytial knots and STB detachment significantly increased in placental villi from the CDP group. STB percentage was significantly lower in the CDP group as well as the PI and Syncytin-1 expression significantly decreased in these placentas, compared with control (NP).
   CONCLUSION Dynamic of trophoblast turnover is altered in placentas from women with CD. These changes may lead into a gap in the placental barrier possibly allowing the parasite entry into the chorionic villi.

AB  - Identification of arthropods important in disease transmission is a crucial, yet difficult, task that can demand considerable training and experience. An important case in point is that of the 150+ species of Triatominae, vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, causative agent of Chagas disease across the Americas. We present a fully automated system that is able to identify triatomine bugs from Mexico and Brazil with an accuracy consistently above 80%, and with considerable potential for further improvement. The system processes digital photographs from a photo apparatus into landmarks, and uses ratios of measurements among those landmarks, as well as (in a preliminary exploration) two measurements that approximate aspects of coloration, as the basis for classification. This project has thus produced a working prototype that achieves reasonably robust correct identification rates, although many more developments can and will be added, and-more broadly-the project illustrates the value of multidisciplinary collaborations in resolving difficult and complex challenges.

AB  - Background
   The demographic transition of populations from rural areas to large urban centers often results in a disordered occupation of forest remnants and increased economic pressure to develop high-income buildings in these areas. Ecological and socioeconomic factors associated with these urban transitions create conditions for the potential transmission of infectious diseases, which was demonstrated for Chagas disease.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We analyzed 930 triatomines, mainly Triatoma tibiamaculata, collected in artificial and sylvatic environments (forests near houses) of a suburban area of the city of Salvador, Bahia State, Brazil between 2007 and 2011. Most triatomines were captured at peridomiciles. Adult bugs predominated in all studied environments, and nymphs were scarce inside houses. Molecular analyses of a randomly selected sub-sample (n=212) of triatomines showed Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates of 65%, 50% and 56% in intradomestic, peridomestic and sylvatic environments, respectively. We detected the T. cruzi lineages I and II and mixed infections. We also showed that T. tibiamaculata fed on blood from birds (50%), marsupials (38%), ruminants (7%) and rodents (5%). The probability of T. cruzi infection was higher in triatomines that fed on marsupial blood (odds ratio (OR)=1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.22-3.11). Moreover, we observed a protective effect against infection in bugs that fed on bird blood (OR=0.43, 95% CI=0.30-0.73).
   Conclusions/Significance
   The frequent invasion of houses by infected triatomines indicates a potential risk of T. cruzi transmission to inhabitants in this area. Our results reinforce that continuous epidemiological surveillance should be performed in areas where domestic transmission is controlled but enzootic transmission persists.

AB  - Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the hemoflagellated parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida). The only available drug to treat chagasic patients in Brazil, the nitroheterocycle benznidazole, is effective solely during the acute phase of the infection. There is accordingly a need to develop new therapeutic tools for the treatment of Chagas disease. This work reports the synthesis, trypanocidal evaluation and human serum albumin (HSA) interactions of a novel series of 1,2,4-triazoles. The new derivatives were synthesized via microwave irradiation in good yields. Most compounds showed toxic effects against T. cruzi with low toxicity to host cells. Three S-alkylated-triazoles showed the best activity profile against amastigotes, with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 3.95 +/- 1.41, 4.15 +/- 0.92 and 3.61 +/- 0.65 mu mol L-1, respectively. The interaction between HSA and 3-[(1E, 3E)-4-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)buta-1,3-dien-1-yl]-5-(butylthio)-4-cyclohexyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-1,2,4-triazole was investigated using multiple spectroscopic techniques and molecular docking, revealing that serum albumin is a potential endogenous carrier to this compound in the human bloodstream.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi requires a triatomine insect vector for its life cycle, which can be complex in different enzootic scenarios, one of which is the unique transmission network in the Atlantic Forest of south-eastern Brazil. In Espirito Santo (ES) State, highly infected Triatoma vitticeps are frequently reported invading domi-ciles. However, triatomines were not found colonizing residences and mammals in the surrounding areas did not present T. cruzi infection. To date, the biotic and abiotic variables that modulate T. vitticeps occurrence and T. cruzi infection in ES State are still unknown. The aim of this study was to identify the environmental variables that modulate their occurrence. Local thematic maps were generated for two response variables: T. vitticeps occurrence and T. cruzi infection. The following explanatory variables were tested: climate (temperature, relative air humidity and rainfall), altitude elevation, mammalian species richness as well as soil and vegetation types. Spatiotemporal distribution patterns and correla-tion levels between response and explanatory variables were assessed through spatial statistics and map algebra modelling. The central and southern mesoregions presented higher T. vitticeps and T. cruzi distributions and can be considered transmission hotspots. The explanatory variables that can explain these phenomena were relative air humidity, average temperature, soil type, altitude ele-vation and mammalian species richness. Algebra map modelling demonstrated that central and southern mesoregions presented the environmental conditions needed for T. vitticeps occurrence and T. cruzi infection. The consideration of environmental variables is essential for understanding the T. cruzi transmission cycle. Cartographic and statistical methodologies used in parasitology have been demonstrated to be reliable and enlightening tools that should be incorporated routinely to expand the understanding of vector-borne parasite transmission.

AB  - Introduction: To characterize Trypanosoma cruzi (TcI) isolated from a Panstrongylus megistus specimen found in one of the biggest metropolitan areas of Latin America, the relationship between the TcI group of T. cruzi and the transmission cycle in the urban environment was studied. Methods: The T. cruzi strain, Pm, was isolated in a culture medium from the evolutionary forms present in the hindgut of a live male specimen of P. megistus found in the Jabaquara subway in Sao Paulo City. The sample from the triatomine showed trypomastigote forms of Trypanosomatidae, which were inoculated in the peritoneum of Balb/c mice. The sample was then inoculated in Liver Infusion Tryptose medium and J774 cells for the molecular identification and characterization of the parasite. The Pm strain of T. cruzi was identified by isolation in axenic culture medium, and based on the morphology, cell infection, growth kinetics, and molecular characterization. Results: After isolation, the protozoan was identified as T. cruzi. No parasites were detected in the peripheral blood of the animal, which can be a characteristic inherent to the strain of T. cruzi that was isolated. Cell invasion assays were performed in triplicate in the J774 cell line to confirm the invasive ability of the Pm strain and revealed amastigote forms of the parasite within macrophages. Conclusions: Our biological and molecular characterizations helped understand parasite-host interactions and their evolutionary history in context of the associations between vectors, ecotopes, hosts, and groups of the parasite.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection with high re-emergence rates in some Amazon regions. The main vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi are haematophagous insects, the triatomines. Only a few reports are available about the occurrence of these wild vectors and their contact with the inhabitants of the riverside regions of the Amazon. This study describes the unusual behaviour of the triatomines that have invaded the homes of the residents of Abaetetuba, the city that has the second highest number of cases of Chagas disease.
   Methods: Two cross-sectional studies were conducted using sero-epidemiological surveys of the inhabitants of Abaetetuba with registered triatomine home invasions. The frequencies of the variables of interestwere analysed using Epi Info version 7.2.
   Results: In 2014 and 2017, 145 persons registered home invasions of triatomines in their domiciles and 16.55% reported having been bitten by insects. The environmental features described indicated potential conditions for the persistence of the parasite's life cycle. Of the enrolled inhabitants, 0.47% were positive for immunoglobulin G anti-T. cruzi antibodies.
   Conclusions: Home invasions of triatomines were confirmed in two periods, with a description of unusual behaviour for the genus Rhodnius. The use of serological surveillance in human populations at risk of this occurrence may constitute a new tool for the early detection of silent infections.

AB  - Background: Among the 18 genera of the Triatominae subfamily, three stand out for their diversity and epidemiological importance: Triatoma, Panstrongylus, and Rhodnius. Rhodnius includes 21 species that can transmit Trypanosoma cruzi (the etiological agent of Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis) and Trypanosoma rangeli. The Rhodnius prolixus complex comprises seven species, including Rhodnius marabaensis, Rhodnius prolixus, and Rhodnius robustus, which occur in the northern region of Brazil. Since both adults and immatures can carry T. cruzi, in this study the five nymphal instars of the three species mentioned were dorsally characterized.
   Methods: Using microscopy, morphometrics, and geometric morphometrics, the present work measures and describes the morphological characters of the five nymphal instars of R. marabaensis, R. prolixus, and R. robustus.
   Results: The study enabled the characterization of all five nymphal instars, as well as the distinction between the three species in each of their instars.
   Conclusions: The morphological, morphometrics of the head, thorax, and abdomen and geometric morphometrics studies of the head enabled the specific distinction of these three species in all five instars.

AB  - Chagas disease is a worldwide public health problem. Although the vectorial transmission of Chagas disease has been controlled in Brazil there are other ways of transmission, such as the ingestion of T. cruzi contaminated food, which ensures the continuation of this zoonosis. Here, we demonstrate the influence of the inoculation route on the establishment and development of the SC2005 T. cruzi strain infection in mice. Groups of Swiss mice were infected intragastrically (IG) or intraperitoneally (IP) with the T. cruzi SC2005 strain derived from an outbreak of oral Chagas disease. The results revealed that 100% of IP infected mice showed parasitemia, while just 36% of IG infected showed the presence of the parasite in blood. The parasitemia peaks were later and less intense in the IG infected mice. Mortality of the IP infected animals was more intense and earlier when compared to the IG infected mice. In the IP infected mice leucopenia occurred in the early infection followed by leucocytosis, correlating positively with the increase of the parasites. However, in the IG infected mice only an increase in monocytes was observed, which was positively correlated with the increase of the parasites. Histopathological analyses revealed a myotropic pattern of the SC2005 strain with the presence of inflammatory infiltrates and parasites in different organs of the animals infected by both routes as well as fibrosis foci and collagen redistribution. The flow cytometric analysis demonstrated a fluctuation of the T lymphocyte population in the blood, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes of the infected animals. T. cruzi DNA associated with the presence of inflammatory infiltrates was detected by PCR in the esophagus, stomach and intestine of all infected mice. These findings are important for the understanding of the pathogenesis of T. cruzi infection by both inoculation routes.

AB  - Introduction: This short communication presents a novel report on the occurrence of Panstrongylus rufotuberculatus in the Brazilian state of Rondonia. Methods: Two specimens were collected inside dwellings and identified using dichotomous keys. Results: The present study showed the extensive geographic distribution of P. rufotuberculatus and the increased number of species in the state of Rondonia. Conclusions: This new record of P. rufotuberculatus is important for understanding the epidemiology of Chagas disease because this species is found naturally infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. Studies on the ecology, biology, and vector-host-parasite interactions of this species are essential for surveillance programs.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi strains from distinct geographic areas show differences in drug resistance and association between parasites genetic and treatment response has been observed. Considering that benznidazole (BZ) can reduce the parasite burden and tissues damage, even in not cured animals and individuals, the goal is to assess the drug response to BZ of T. cruzi II strains isolated from children of the Jequitinhonha Valley, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, before treatment. Mice infected and treated with BZ in both phases of infection were compared with the untreated and evaluated by fresh blood examination, haemoculture, polymerase chain reaction, conventional (ELISA) and non-conventional (FC-ALTA) serologies. In mice treated in the acute phase, a significant decrease in parasitaemia was observed for all strains. Positive parasitological and/or serological tests in animals treated during the acute and chronic (95.1-100%) phases showed that most of the strains were BZ resistant. However, beneficial effect was demonstrated because significant reduction (p < 0.05%) and/or suppression of parasitaemia was observed in mice infected with all strains (acute phase), associated to reduction/elimination of inflammation and fibrosis for two/eight strains. BZ offered some benefit, even in not cured animals, what suggest that BZ use may be recommended at least for recent chronic infection of the studied region.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease (CD) is considered a public health problem in Latin America. The northeastern region, especially the state of Ceara, still represents a major concern in terms of the risk of transmission of CD.
   Objective: To estimate the prevalence of T. cruzi in blood donors from the state of Ceara.
   Methods: This is a retrospective descriptive study that was performed in the period from 2010 to 2015 from data recorded in the computerized system of the Hematology and Hemotherapy Center of Ceara (HEMOCE in Portuguese).
   Results: Of the 763,731 potential blood donors, 14,159 were serologically ineligible; 1,982 (0.33%) were serologically ineligible due to positive / inconclusive diagnosis for CD. A total of 425 individuals came to the HEMOCE to repeat the test, with 28.2% (120/425) declared ineligible for donations due to CD.
   Conclusion: No significant reduction of positive / inconclusive serology was observed in the period between 2010 and 2015, but a reduction was observed when compared to 1996/1997 in the state. The determination of the prevalence of CD in blood banks may be relevant as an indicator of the risk of CD transmission through blood transfusions in a given region. New serological tests for triage with better accuracy in screening are needed, in an attempt to reduce the unnecessary disposal of blood bags, reduce costs for the Brazilian Unified Health System, and diminish insecurity for the patient and family members.

AB  - Chagas disease is still a major public health issue in many Latin American countries. One of the current major challenges is to find an association between Trypanosoma cruzi discrete typing units (DTUs) and clinical manifestations of the disease. In this study, we used a multilocus conventional PCR and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) approaches to perform the molecular typing and parasite load quantification directly from blood specimens of 65 chronic Chagas disease patients. All patients were recruited at the same health center, but their place of birth were widely distributed in different geographic regions of Brazil. Of the 65 patients, 35(53.8%) presented positive amplification by real time qPCR, being 20 (30.7%) with the clinical indeterminate form and 15 (23.1%) with the cardiac form of the disease. The parasite load median for all positive patients was 2.54 [1.43-11.14] parasite equivalents/mL (par. Eq./mL), with the load ranging from 0.12 to 153.66 par. Eq./mL. Noteworthy, the parasite load was significantly higher in patients over 70 years old (median 20.05 [18.29-86.86] par. Eq./mL). Using guanidine-EDTA blood samples spiked with reference T. cruzi strains, belonging to the six DTUs, it was possible to genotype the parasite up to 0.5 par. Eq./mL, with high specificity. Of the patients with positive qPCR, it was possible to identify the T. cruzi DTU in 28 patients (80%). For the remaining patients (20%), at least a partial result was obtained. Analysis of specimens showed prevalences of TcVI, TcII and mixed infection TcVI+TcII equal to 40%, 17.1% and 14.3%, respectively. In addition, two patients were infected by TcV, and one patient was coinfected by TcIII+TcVI, These last three patients were in stage A of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC), and they were born at the Bahia State (northeast region of Brazil). When T. cruzi genotypes were compared with the parasite load, more elevated parasite loads were observed in patients infected by TcII in general (parasite load median of 7.56 par. Eq./mL) in comparison to patients infected by TcVI (median of 2.35 par. Eq./mL). However, while the frequency of CCC was 50% in patients infected by TcVI and TcV, only 16.7% of patients infected by TcII evolved to CCC. Taking together, our results contribute to update the epidemiological knowledge of T. cruzi DTUs in Brazil, and highlight the age of patient and infection by TcII as important features that lead to the observation of higher parasitemia levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND Triatoma sordida and Triatoma pseudomaculata are frequently captured triatomine species in the Brazilian savannah and caatinga biomes, respectively, and in Brazilian domiciles.
   OBJECTIVES This study identified eco-epidemiological changes in Chagas disease in northern Minas Gerais state, Brazil, and considered the influence of environmental shifts and both natural and anthropogenic effects.
   METHODS Domicile infestation and Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates were obtained from triatomines and sylvatic reservoirs during the following two time periods: the 1980s and 2007/2008. Entomological and climatic data with land cover classification derived from satellite imagery were integrated into a geographic information system (GIS), which was applied for atmospheric correction, segmentation, image classification, and mapping and to analyse data obtained in the field. Climatic data were analysed and compared to land cover classifications.
   RESULTS A comparison of current data with data obtained in the 1980's showed that T. sordida colonised domiciliary areas in both periods, and that T. pseudomaculata did not colonise these areas. There was a tendency toward a reduction in T. cruzi infection rates in sylvatic reservoirs, and of triatomines captured in both households and in the sylvatic environment. T. sordida populations have reduced in the sylvatic environment, while T. pseudomaculata showed an expanding trend in the region compared to counts observed in the 1980's in the sylvatic environment. This may be related to high deforestation rates as well as gradual increases in land surface temperature (LST) and temperatures along the years.
   MAIN CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest a geographical expansion of species into new biomes as a result of anthropogenic and climatic changes that directly interfere with the reproductive and infection processes of vectors.

AB  - BackgroundKnowledge of triatomine food sources in different ecotopes enables the estimation of T. cruzi transmission risk in diverse environments, as well as its dynamics of dispersion and ecological niche. For Triatoma brasiliensis in the Caatinga, in the northeast of Brazil, seasonal differences influence feeding eclecticism and rates of T. cruzi infection. The objective of the present study was to monitor food sources and to characterize the populations of T. cruzi associated with T. brasiliensis in wild and domestic environments in the Caatinga of northeast Brazil.MethodsA cross-sectional study based on a search for triatomines in wild and domestic environments, was undertaken at five different time periods from 2009 to 2015. Insects from 2015 were used for identification of food sources. Two universal primers, based on the conserved regions of the 12S rRNA locus, were used to amplify fragments of 215 bp. The content of the intestinal tract of triatomines was identified by a comparison between the sequences obtained and those deposited in the GenBank database, using BLAST. In triatomines with parasitological diagnosis of infection by trypanosomatids, xenoculture was performed for the isolation and characterization of strains, using cox2, the amplification of the SL-IL mini-exon intergenic spacer and the polymorphism of the D7 divergent domain of the gene 24rDNA-LSU.ResultsFood sources were identified in 76.3% (213/279) T. brasiliensis specimens sampled in 2015. The most frequent sources in a total of 20 vertebrate species were: rodents (58%, 123/213), ruminants (30%, 64/213) and cats (6%, 12/213). A total of 49% (44/89) of the samples of T. cruzi isolated in the period from 2009 to 2015 were characterized: TcII (43%, 19/44), TcI (41%, 18/44) and TcIII (16%, 7/44).ConclusionsThe feeding eclecticism of T. brasiliensis shows its importance in maintaining the transmission dynamics of T. cruzi, with evidence of intense circulation between anthropic and wild environments. Attention should be placed on the association among T. brasiliensis, rodents and ruminants, in addition to the presence of TcIII in the study region.

AB  - Trogocytosis was originally thought to be restricted to the interaction of cells of the immune system with cancer cells. Such membrane exchanges are probably a general process in cell biology, and membrane exchange has been demonstrated to occur between non-immune cells within an organism. Herein, we report that membrane and protein exchange, consistent with trogocytosis, between Trypanosoma cruzi (both the Brazil and Tulahuen strains) and the mammalian cells it infects. Transfer of labeled membrane patches was monitored by labeling of either parasites or host cells, i.e. human foreskin fibroblasts and rat myoblasts. Trypomastigotes and amastigotes transferred specific surface glycoproteins to the host cells along with membranes. Exchange of membranes between the parasite and host cells occurred during successful invasion. Extracellular amastigotes did not transfer membrane patches and were did not transfer either membranes or proteins to the host cells. Membrane exchange was also found to occur between interacting epimastigotes in cell-free culture and may be important in parasite-parasite interactions as well. Further studies should provide new insights into pathogenesis and provide targets for therapeutic intervention. (C) 2014 Institut Pasteur. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background
   The aim of this work was to explore the potential risk of vector-borne Chagas disease in urban districts in northeastern Brazil, by analyzing the spatiotemporal distributions and natural infection rates with Trypanosoma cruzi of triatomine species captured in recent years. The main motivation of this work was an acute human case of Chagas disease reported in 2008 in the municipality of Sobral.
   Methodology/principal findings
   We analyzed data from community-based entomological surveillance carried out from 2010 to 2014. Triatomine natural T. cruzi infection was assessed by examination of insect feces by optical microscopy. Sites of triatomine capture were georeferenced through Google Earth and analyzed with ArcGIS. A total of 191 triatomines were collected, consisting of 82.2% Triatoma pseudomaculata, 7.9% Rhodnius nasutus, 5.8% T. brasiliensis, 3.7% Panstrongylus lutzi, and 0.5% P. megistus, with an overall natural infection index of 17.8%. Most infestations were reported in the districts of Dom Jose (36.2%), Padre Palhano (24.7%), and Alto do Cristo (10.6%). The overwhelming majority of insects (185/96.9%) were captured inside houses, and most insects tended to be collected in intermittent peaks. Moreover, captured triatomines tended to constitute colonies. The acute case reported in 2008 was found to be situated within a T. pseudomaculata hotspot.
   Conclusion
   The triatomine collection events carried out by dwellers were aggregated in time and space into distinct foci, suggesting that insects are intermittently and artificially introduced into the city, possibly via accidental migration from their natural reservoirs. The relatively high T. cruzi infection rate indicates considerable circulation of the parasite in these areas, increasing the risk of vector-borne Chagas disease infection. These data suggest a need to strengthen epidemiological surveillance and integrate appropriate control actions targeting triatomines, T. cruzi reservoirs, and human populations. Our data also identify Chagas disease transmission as a hazard in urban areas of Sobral.

The study with 260 patients and 150 controls was conducted in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil. Thegenotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP. The A allele and A/A genotype of IL17A were significantly increased in patients and their subgroups patients with CCC; patients with CCCand LVSD; and patients with CCCand severe LVSD) when compared to the control group. The analysis according to the gender showed that the A/A genotype of IL17A was more frequent in female with LVSD and mild to moderate LVSD and also in male patients with LVSD. The frequency of IL17F T/C genotype was male patients with CCC and severe LVSD and in female with mild to moderate LVSD. The results suggest the possible involvement of the polymorphisms of IL17A and IL17F in the susceptibility to chronic Chagas disease and in development and progression of cardiomyopathy.

AB  - Chagas disease is one of the most significant systemic parasitosis in Latin America, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, which is mainly transmitted by hematophagous insects, the triatomines. This research was carried out in both domestic and wild environments throughout a Northeastern rural locality. Triatomines were captured in both peridomicile and wild environments, obtaining 508 specimens of triatomines, of which 99.6% were Triatoma brasiliensis. Insects were captured in 10 (18.5%) peridomiciles with an average of 8.3 triatomines per residence. Triatoma brasiliensis nymphs and adults were found in six peridomiciles, generating a 11.1% colonization. No T. cruzi infection was detected in the 447 peridomestic insects analyzed. On the other hand, of the 55 sylvatic T. brasiliensis molecularly examined for T. cruzi, 12 (21%) were positive, all harboring T. cruzi I. The blood meal analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from gut content revealed that both peridomestic and wild triatomine populations fed mainly on birds, refractory to the parasite, which may explain the null rate of natural infection prevalence in the domestic environment. However, infected triatomines for potential home infestation within the radius of insect dispersion capacity were registered in rock outcrops around the dwellings. Anthropogenic environmental influences are able to rapidly alter these scenarios. Therefore, to avoid disease transmission to humans, we recommend constant vector control combined with periodic serological surveillance. The associated methodology presented herein may serve as a model for early detections of risk factors for Chagas disease transmission in the Brazilian Northeast.

AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 40 dogs with clinical signs suggestive of infection by Leishmania spp and Trypanosoma cruzi in the municipality of Lazaro Cardenas, Quintana Roo, Mexico. Blood, skin and bone marrow samples were taken. Indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) tests for detection of anti-Leishmania infantum and immunochromatic test for the detection of anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies in serum were performed. In addition, molecular analyses were performed using PCR to detect Leishmania spp in bone marrow and skin and T. cruzi in bone marrow. Histopathological analyses of the skin and cytology of the bone marrow were carried out in search of lesions and trypanosomatid agents. The results showed that 3 (7.5%) and 6 (15%) dogs with anti-L. infantum and T. cruzi antibodies were detected, respectively. Molecular analyses detected 17 dogs positive for infection by T. cruzi (42.5%) and none for infection by Leishmania spp. Dogs with low body condition showed greater seropositivity to T. cruzi using Fisher's exact test (p<0.05). Parasites of the genus Leishmania did not actively participate in the pathological processes of the animals; however, a high frequency of animals infected with T. cruzi was observed.

AB  - The identification of the magnitude of chronic Chagas disease in Brazil requires linking activities in health surveillance, seeking to develop a wide, hierarchically organized and geographically distributed network of services to provide care to thousands of individuals with Trypanosoma cruzi infection. The study aimed to elaborate a model for prioritization of municipalities for chronic Chagas disease, to offer comprehensive care for persons with the disease. A multicriteria analysis was thus performed using the PROMETHEE II algorithm, implemented in the Pradin software. The criteria for assessing the model consisted of three indices built from the following indicators: (a) epidemiological, directly related to chronic Chagas disease, (b) related to the evolution in chronic Chagas disease, and (c) related to access to health services. Saaty's Fundamental Scale was used to define the indicators' weights, with greater importance assigned to those directly related to chronic Chagas disease and to those with greater reliability and respective quality of information. Assessment of the models' consistency was based on comparison of the available data in historically endemic areas with the distribution of acute cases, besides other sensitivity analyses. The best model was defined by 1,345 municipalities with medium priority, 1,003 high priority, and 601 with very high priority for chronic Chagas disease, with the highest proportions in the Southeast and Northeast regions. Prioritization allows the administration to rationalize and channel resources, and it is essential to identify the territories where persons with chronic Chagas disease are living, to promote comprehensive care and improve quality of life.

AB  - The main threats to primates worldwide are the degradation, fragmentation, and loss of their habitats; hunting (especially for bushmeat); and illegal trade. For many species, the most important threat is forest fragmentation, resulting in small populations that are restricted to isolated forest patches. In this situation, primates are particularly vulnerable to disease. The Endangered blonde capuchin (Sapajus flavius) is now restricted to a few forest patches in Northeast Brazil. We investigated the occurrence of parasites and bacterial diseases in one of three free-ranging groups of S. flavius in a small forest patch in Paraiba state, Northeast Brazil. We tested for antibodies against Leishmania spp., Trypanosoma cruzi, Toxoplasma gondii, Leptospira spp. (24 strains), and Brucella spp.. We used molecular analysis to detect Plasmodium spp., and evaluated blood smears for the presence of hemoparasites. All individuals tested negative for Leptospira spp. and B. abortus, but 8 of 48 (16%) presented antibodies for both Leishmania spp. and T. cruzi. We identified antibodies to T. gondii in 12% of the individuals tested. Plasmodium brasilianum infection was present in 4% of the individuals tested, and blood smears showed microfilariae parasites in 46% of the individuals tested. The occurrence of these infectious diseases in S. flavius may pose a significant threat in terms of reduced recruitment and poor survival rates, and an understanding of the influence of pathogens is crucial for the management of small populations of primates.

AB  - Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease, is endemic in 21 Latin American countries and particularly prevalent in Brazil. Chagas disease has drawn more attention in recent years due to its expansion into non-endemic areas. The aim of this work was to computationally identify and experimentally validate the natural products from an Annonaceae family as antichagasic agents. Through the ligand-based virtual screening, we identified 57 molecules with potential activity against the epimastigote form of T. cruzi. Then, 16 molecules were analyzed in the in vitro study, of which, six molecules displayed previously unknown antiepimastigote activity. We also evaluated these six molecules for trypanocidal activity. We observed that all six molecules have potential activity against the amastigote form, but no molecules were active against the trypomastigote form. 13-Epicupressic acid seems to be the most promising, as it was predicted as an active compound in the in silico study against the amastigote form of T. cruzi, in addition to having in vitro activity against the epimastigote form.

AB  - Canis lupus familiaris (domestic dog) represents a reliable sentinel for the occurrence of a well-established transmission cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi among wild mammals in the surroundings and, consequently, where the risk of human infection exists. Serological diagnosis is the chosen method to identify T. cruzi infection in dogs that, in Brazil, rarely present positive parasitological tests. The use of recombinant chimeric parasitic antigens results in a sensitive and specific serological diagnostic test in contrast to the use of crude T. cruzi antigens. Our objective was to evaluate the Chagas/Bio-Manguinhos Lateral Flow Immunochromatographic Rapid Test (Chagas-LFRT) for the diagnosis of T. cruzi infection in domestic dogs and the potential of application of this diagnostic platform to wild canid species. Two recombinant proteins (IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4) that displayed the best performance in the enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) in previous studies were tested in a platform with two diagnostic bands. A panel of 281 dog serum samples was evaluated: 133 positive for T. cruzi by serological diagnosis, including 20 samples with positive blood cultures belonging to different discrete typing units (DTUs); 129 negative samples; and 19 samples from dogs infected by other trypanosomatids: Leishmania infantum, Trypanosoma rangeli, Trypanosoma caninum and Crithidia mellificae, in addition to samples infected by Anaplasma platys, Dirofilaria immitis and Erlichia sp. that were employed to evaluate eventual cross-reactions. We also evaluated the Chagas-LFRT to detect T. cruzi infection in 9 serum samples from six wild canid species. We observed that the intensity pattern of the bands was directly proportional to the serological titer observed in IFAT. The sensitivity was 94%, the specificity was 91% according to the ROC curve, and the defined cutoff was an optical density of 4.8. The agreement obtained was considered substantial by the kappa analysis (84%). From T. cruzi positive hemoculture samples, 88.9% were positive by Chagas-LFRT. The test was efficient in recognizing infections by five of the six T. cruzi DTUs. Cross-reactions were not observed in infections by L. infantum, T. rangeli, T. caninum and D. immitis; however, they were observed in sera of dogs infected by Crithidia mellificae, Anaplasma sp. and Erlichia sp. A strong reaction was observed when serum samples from wild canids were submitted to the Protein A affinity test, confirming its applicability for these species. This test will allow rapid preventive actions in areas with high risk to the emergence of Chagas disease in a safer, reliable, low-cost and immediate manner, without the need for more complex laboratory tests.

AB  - Considered ecologically generalist, Didelphis albiventris is reported as reservoir for different species of parasites, especially Trypanosoma cruzi. However, the knowledge about the influence of T. cruzi on hematological parameters of free-living opossum remains scarce. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of T. cruzi on hematological parameters of white-ear opossums (D. albiventris) from Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. The blood samples and biometric data were collected from 40 opossums captured by Tomahawk and Sherman traps in six urban forest fragments located in the city. The health of these animals was inferred, mainly, by means of blood parameters (PCV, RBC, WBC, MCV and WBC differential). Molecular detection of T. cruzi infection was performed by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR), using 18S and 24S alpha rDNA region as target. Paired-t-test and simple linear regression were used for statistical analysis. No significant difference was observed between the averages of hematological variables in relation to gender and body condition. The molecular diagnosis showed that 32.5% (13/40) of the opossums were infected by T. cruzi, which presented lymphocytosis (3.4 +/- 1.5) and eosinophilia (0.09 +/- 0.13). Path analysis showed that T. cruzi infection resulted in increased numbers of lymphocytes and indirectly decreased the body condition of opossums. Moreover T. cruzi infection resulted in a direct effect on decrease of MCV. Overall, our results suggest that T. cruzi infection may represent a risk to health of opossums since the lyrnphocytosis may cause a secondary damage on body condition of infected animals.

AB  - Introduction: Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is widely distributed in nature, circulating between triatomine bugs and sylvatic mammals, and has large genetic diversity. Both the vector species and the genetic lineages of T. cruzi present a varied geographical distribution. This study aimed to verify the influence of sympatry in the interaction of T. cruzi with triatomines. Methods: The behavior of the strains PR2256 (T. cruzi II) and AM14 (T. cruzi IV) was studied in Triatoma sordida (TS) and Rhodnius robustus (RR). Eleven fifth-stage nymphs were fed by artificial xenodiagnosis with 5.6 x 10(3) blood trypomastigotes/0.1mL of each T. cruzi strain. Every 20 days, their excreta were examined for up to 100 days, and every 30 days, the intestinal content was examined for up to 120 days, by parasitological (fresh examination and differential count with Giemsa-stained smears) and molecular (PCR) methods. Rates of infectivity, metacyclogenesis and mortality, and mean number of parasites per insect and of excreted parasites were determined. Results: Sympatric groups RR+AM14 and TS+PR2256 showed higher values of the four parameters, except for mortality rate, which was higher (27.3%) in the TS+AM14 group. General infectivity was 72.7%, which was mainly proven by PCR, showing the following decreasing order: RR+AM14 (100%), TS+PR2256 (81.8%), RR+PR2256 (72.7%) and TS+AM14 (36.4%). Conclusions: Our working hypothesis was confirmed once higher infectivity and vector capacity (flagellate production and elimination of infective metacyclic forms) were recorded in the groups that contained sympatric T. cruzi lineages and triatomine species.

AB  - Background
   Trypanosoma cruzi, the causal agent of Chagas disease, is monophyletic but genetically heterogeneous. It is currently represented by six genetic lineages (Discrete Typing Units, DTUs) designated Tcl-TcVI. Tcl is the most geographically widespread and genetically heterogeneous lineage, this as is evidenced by a wide range of genetic markers applied to isolates spanning a vast geographic range in Latin America.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   In total, 78 Tcl isolated from hosts and vectors distributed in 5 different biomes of Brazil, were analyzed using 6 nuclear housekeeping genes, 25 microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial marker. Nuclear markers reveal substantial genetic diversity, significant gene flow between biomes, incongruence in phylogenies, and haplotypic analysis indicative of intra-DTU genetic exchange. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on mitochondrial and nuclear loci were incongruent, and consistent with introgression. Structure analysis of microsatellite data reveals that, amongst biomes, the Amazon is the most genetically diverse and experiences the lowest level of gene flow. Investigation of population structure based on the host species/genus, indicated that Didelphis marsupialis might play a role as the main disperser of Tcl.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The present work considers a large Tcl sample from different hosts and vectors spanning multiple ecologically diverse biomes in Brazil. Importantly, we combine fast and slow evolving markers to contribute to the epizootiological understanding of Tcl in five distinct Brazilian biomes. This constitutes the first instance in which MLST analysis was combined with the use of MLMT and maxicircle markers to evaluate the genetic diversity of Tcl isolates in Brazil. Our results demonstrate the existence of substantial genetic diversity and the occurrence of introgression events. We provide evidence of genetic exchange in Tcl isolates from Brazil and of the relative isolation of Tcl in the Amazon biome. We observe the absence of strict associations with Tcl genotypes to geographic areas and/or host species.

AB  - Since the decline in new cases of infection by insect/vector, congenital Chagas disease has become more relevant in the transmission of Chagas disease. Treatment with benznidazole significantly reduces the parasitemia, which constitutes an important factor linked to vertical transmission. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether treatment with benznidazole previously administered to women of childbearing age can prevent or reduce the incidence of new cases of congenital Chagas disease. An historical cohort study that included all women in reproductive age (15-45 years) assisted in our center was designed. We included 67 mothers with chronic Chagas disease; 35 women had not been treated prior to pregnancy, 15 had been treated prior to pregnancy and 17 gave birth prior and after treatment with benznidazole.
   Eight mothers gave birth to 16 children with congenital Chagas disease (8/67, 12%). The prevalence of congenital Chagas was 16/114 (14%) children born to untreated mothers and 0/42 (0%) children born to benznidazole- treated mothers, p = 0.01. No significant differences were observed in clinical, serologic, epidemiological or socioeconomic baseline variables between mothers with and without children born with congenital Chagas. A 32% conversion rate to negative serology was observed in benznidazole-treated women after long-term follow up. Antiparasitic treatment administered to women in reproductive age can prevent the occurrence of congenital Chagas disease.

AB  - American trypanosomiasis is an emerging zoonosis in the Brazilian Amazon. Studies on benznidazole (BZ) chemotherapy with Trypanosoma cruzi from this region have great relevance, given the different discrete typing units (DTUs) that infect humans in the Amazon and other regions of Brazil. We performed a parasitological, histopathological, and molecular analysis of mice inoculated with strains of T. cruzi I, II, and IV that were BZ-treated during the acute phase of infection. Groups of Swiss mice were inoculated; 13 received oral BZ, whereas the other 13 comprised the untreated controls. Unlike parasitemia, the infectivity and mortality did not vary among the DTUs. Trypanosoma cruzi DNA was detected in all tissues analyzed and the proportion of organs parasitized varied with the parasite DTU. The BZ treatment reduced the most parasitological parameters, tissue parasitism and the inflammatory processes at all infection stages and for all DTUs. However, the number of significant reductions varied according to the DTU and infection phase.

AB  - In Brazil, orally acquired T. cruzi infection has become the most relevant transmission mechanisms from public health perspective. Around 70% of new Chagas disease cases have been associated with consumption of contaminated food or beverages. Acai (Euterpe oleracea and Euterpe precatoria) is currently one of the most commercialized Amazonian fruits in the Brazilian and international markets. Therefore, it has become important to incorporate in the production process some procedures to measure out effective hygiene and product quality control required by global market. Molecular methods have been developed for rapid detection and quantification of T. cruzi DNA in several biological samples, including food matrices, for epidemiological investigation of Chagas disease and food quality control. However, a high-performance molecular methodology since DNA extraction until detection and quantification of T. cruzi DNA in acai berry pulp is still needed. Herein, a simple DNA extraction methodology was standardized from the supernatant of acai berry pulp stabilized in a 6M Guanidine-HCl/0.2M EDTA buffer. In addition, a multiplex real time qPCR assay, targeting T. cruzi DNA and an Exogenous Internal Positive Control was developed and validated, using reference from all T. cruzi DTUs and commercial samples of acai pulp, from an endemic municipality with previous history of oral Chagas disease outbreak. Thus, a high-sensitivity qPCR assay, that could detect up to 0.01 parasite equivalents/mL in acai, was reached. As of the 45 commercial samples analyzed, 9 (20%) were positive for T. cruzi. This high-sensitive, fast, and easy-to-use molecular assay is compatible with most of the laboratories involved in the investigations of oral Chagas disease outbreaks, representing an important tool to the epidemiology, control, and surveillance of Chagas disease.

AB  - Triatoma infestans is a mandatory haematophagous vector of Chagas disease in Brazil. Despite a large number of studies on the anti-haemostatic molecules present in its saliva, the role of its salivary components on parasite transmission is poorly understood. Here, we show that the bioactive lipid molecule, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), is present in the salivary gland of T. infestans. We characterized the lipid profiles of each unit of the T. infestans salivary gland. We noticed that LPC is present in the three units of the salivary gland and that the insect feeding state does not influence its proportion. 7'. infestans saliva and LPC can enhance T. cruzi transmission to mice by dramatically altering the profile of inflammatory cells at the site of inoculation on mouse skin, facilitating the transmission of T. cruzi to the vertebrate host. Consequently, the mortality curves of either saliva- or LPC-injected mice display significant higher mortality rates than the control. Altogether, these results implicate LPC as one of key salivary molecule involved in Chagas disease transmission.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc), the causative agent of Chagas disease, affects millions of people worldwide. One of the major characteristics of T. cruzi is related to its heterogeneity due to the variability of its biological properties, parasite growth rates, infectivity, tissue tropism, morbidity and virulence among different isolates observed during experimental or human infection. Moreover, presence of mixed infections in the same host in endemic areas is a matter of study due to its impact on clinical manifestations and disease progression. In this study, we evaluated the biological behavior of two Tc I strains AQ1-7 (AQ) and MUTUM (MT) and one Tc II strain (JG) during the acute phase of infection, in unique and mixed infections. A patent blood parasitism was detected only in mice inoculated with JG strain. In addition blood parasitism parameters (peak and average blood parasitism) were positively associated when JG and AQ strains were combined. In contrast, a negative association was observed in the JG+MUTUM group. The predominance of TcII strain over TcI strains was highlighted using the LSSP-PCR technique, which was performed in samples from hemoculture. Thus, this study showed important biological differences between different T. cruzi strains and discrete typing units (DTUs) in acute phase. Finally, we observed that blood parasitism during early period of infection seems to be more related to DTU than to a specific strain.

AB  - An outbreak of Chagas disease, possibly involving its vector Triatoma brasiliensis brasiliensis, was identified in the state of Rio Grande do Norte (RN). Given the historical significance of this vector in public health, the study aimed to evaluate its role in the transmission dynamics of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi in an area undergoing desertification in the Serido ' region, RN, Brazil. We captured triatomines in sylvatic and anthropic ecotopes. Natural vector infection was determined using parasitological and molecular methods and we identified discrete typing units (DTUs) of T. cruzi by analyzing the COII gene of mtDNA, 24Sa rDNA, and mini-exon gene. Their blood meals sources were identified by amplification and sequencing of the mtDNA cytochrome b gene. A total of 952 T. b. brasiliensis were captured in peridomestic (69.9%) and sylvatic ecotopes (30.4%). A wide range of natural infection rates were observed in peridomestic (36.0% - 71.1%) and sylvatic populations (28.6% - 100.0%). We observed the circulation of TcI and TcII DTUs with a predominance of Tcl in sylvatic and peridomestic environments. Kerodon rupestris, rocky cavy (13/39), Homo sapiens, human (8/39), and Bos taurus, ox (6/39) were the most frequently detected blood meals sources. Thus, Triatoma b. brasiliensis is invading and colonizing the human dwellings. Furthermore, high levels of natural infection, coupled with the detection of TcI and TcII DTUs, and also the detection of K. rupestris and H. sapiens as blood meals sources of infected T. b. brasiliensis indicate a risk of T. cruzi transmission to human populations in areas undergoing desertification.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Chagas disease (CD), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a flagellate protozoan, was discovered over 100 years ago, spread throughout the Americas, mainly in South America, affecting millions of people around the world. CD affects several people in the Western Region of Amazonia, with increasingly frequent numbers due to several factors that contribute to the increase of cases in the region. but the consumption of contaminated drink is the main way of transmission of the disease in the region. This study aims to describe and analyze the epidemiological panorama of Chagas disease in the state of Amazonas, from 2004 to 2014. Methods: This is an ecological study, where only secondary data obtained from Sinan referring to reported cases of T. cruzi infection in the entire state of Amazonas were used. Results: a total of 100 cases of CD were reported in the state of Amazonas, from 2004 to 2014,, with a higher occurrence in 2007 and 2010, during April and December, with a higher frequency in the 20- 39 age group and in women. Conclusion: the need to implement an effective epidemiological control service to monitor the CD transmission route and its vectors was identified, because it is a public health problem that may be linked to social and cultural determinants. The promotion of educational activities to raise awareness of the community of this disease.

AB  - Congenital Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is responsible for 22.5% of new cases each year. However, placental transmission occurs in only 5% of infected mothers and it has been proposed that the epithelial turnover of the trophoblast can be considered a local placental defense against the parasite. Thus, Trypanosoma cruzi induces cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptotic cell death in the trophoblast, which are regulated, among other mechanisms, by small non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs. On the other hand, ex vivo infection of human placental explants induces a specific microRNA profile that includes microRNAs related to trophoblast differentiation such as miR-512-3p miR-515-5p, codified at the chromosome 19 microRNA cluster. Here we determined the expression validated target genes of miR-512-3p and miR-515-5p, specifically human glial cells missing 1 transcription factor and cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein, as well as the expression of the main trophoblast differentiation marker human chorionic gonadotrophin during ex vivo infection of human placental explants, and examined how the inhibition or overexpression of both microRNAs affects parasite infection. We conclude that Trypanosoma cruzi-induced trophoblast epithelial turnover, particularly trophoblast differentiation, is at least partially mediated by placenta-specific miR-512-3p and miR-515-5p and that both miRNAs mediate placental susceptibility to ex vivo infection of human placental explants. Knowledge about the role of parasite-modulated microRNAs in the placenta might enable their use as biomarkers, as prognostic and therapeutic tools for congenital Chagas disease in the future.

AB  - Triatomines are blood-sucking insects that transmit the causative agent of Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi. Despite being recognized as a difficult task, the correct taxonomic identification of triatomine species is crucial for vector control in Latin America, where the disease is endemic. In this context, we have developed a web and mobile tool based on PostgreSQL database to help healthcare technicians to overcome the difficulties to identify triatomine vectors when the technical expertise is missing. The web and mobile version makes use of real triatomine species pictures and dichotomous key method to support the identification of potential vectors that occur in Brazil. It provides a user example-driven interface with simple language. TriatoKey can also be useful for educational purposes.

AB  - Cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction are a significant complication of chronic Chagas disease, with heart failure, stroke, and sudden death related to disease progression. Thus, understanding the signaling pathways involved in the chagasic cardiac hypertrophy may provide potential targets for pharmacological therapy. Herein, we investigated the implication of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling pathway in triggering hypertrophic phenotype during acute and chronic T. cruzi infection. C57BL/6 mice infected with T. cruzi (Brazil strain) were evaluated for electrocardiographic (ECG) changes, plasma levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and activation of signaling pathways involved in cardiac hypertrophy, including FAK and ERK1/2, as well as expression of hypertrophy marker and components of the extracellular matrix in the different stages of T. cruzi infection (60-210 dpi). Heart dysfunction, evidenced by prolonged PR interval and decrease in heart rates in ECG tracing, was associated with high plasma ET-1 level, extracellular matrix remodeling and FAK signaling activation. Upregulation of both FAK tyrosine 397 (FAK-Y397) and serine 910 (FAK-5910) residues phosphorylation as well as ERK1/2 activation, lead to an enhancement of atrial natriuretic peptide gene expression in chronic infection. Our findings highlight FAK-ERK1/2 signaling as a regulator of cardiac hypertrophy in Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Both mechanical stress, induced by cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) augment and cardiac overload, and ET-1 stimuli orchestrated FAK signaling activation with subsequent activation of the fetal cardiac gene program in the chronic phase of infection, highlighting FAK as an attractive target for Chagas disease therapy.

AB  - Background: The inefficiency of the current tachyzoite antigen-based serological assays for the serodiagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii infection mandates the need for acquirement of reliable and standard diagnostic reagents. Recently, epitope-based antigens have emerged as an alternative diagnostic marker for the achievement of highly sensitive and specific capture antigens. In this study, the diagnostic utility of a recombinant multiepitope antigen (USM.TOXO1) for the serodiagnosis of human toxoplasmosis was evaluated.
   Methods: An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed to evaluate the usefulness of USM. TOXO1 antigen for the detection of IgG antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii in human sera. Whereas the reactivity of the developed antigen against IgM antibody was evaluated by western blot and Dot enzyme immunoassay (dot-EIA) analysis.
   Results: The diagnostic performance of the new antigens in IgG ELISA was achieved at the maximum values of 85. 43% and 81.25% for diagnostic sensitivity and specificity respectively. The USM.TOXO1 was also proven to be reactive with anti-T. gondii IgM antibody.
   Conclusions: This finding makes the USM. TOXO1 antigen an attractive candidate for improving the toxoplasmosis serodiagnosis and demonstrates that multiepitope antigens could be a potential and promising diagnostic marker for the development of high sensitive and accurate assays.

AB  - Chagas disease (ChD), caused by the hemoflagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is an important morbidity that affects approximately six million people in the American continent. T. cruzi parasites are mainly transmitted to human by the infected feces of blood-sucking triatomine insects. The persistent disease is endemic in many regions of South America, mostly affecting residents of rural areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate epidemiological aspects of ChD in the state of Pi-aui located in northeastern Brazil. This is an analytical cross-sectional study carried out from the collection of data of the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN, in Portuguese, Sistema de Informacoes de Agravos de Notificacao) of suspected and confirmed cases of acute ChD in the state of Piaui, in the period 2010-2019. Associations between T. cruzi positivity and the study variables were determined by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and were raised as prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence interval. According to this survey, 517 suspected cases of acute ChD were reported in Piaui, with 70 cases (13.5%) confirmed. In 88.5% of confirmed cases, confirmation occurred by laboratory diagnosis. Most of the confirmed cases occurred in municipalities located in the semiarid region, with the municipality of Sao Joao do Piaui presenting the highest number of cases. Regarding sociodemographic data, females represent 55.7% of cases, people over 50 years of age (55.7%), being three cases in people up to 18 years of age, and less than 8 years of schooling (67.1%). 77.9% of confirmed cases had vector transmission as the probable form of infection. The data available in this study conclude that vectorial transmission of ChD in the state of Piaui remains active. This fact is corroborated by the number of notified and confirmed cases of acute ChD, requiring housing improvement programs and more effective epidemiological surveillance to control the transmission of the disease in the state.

AB  - Background
   Trypanosoma cruzi is an intracellular parasite that causes debilitating chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM), for which there is no effective drug or vaccine. Previously, we demonstrated increased cardiac lipid accumulation and endoplasmic reticulum stress in mice with CCM. Increased endoplasmic reticulum stress may lead to uncontrolled SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) activation and lipotoxicity in the myocardium during the intermediate stage of infection and result in progression to chronic CCM. Therefore, we investigated whether inhibiting SREBP activation modulates CCM progression in T cruzi-infected mice.
   Methods and Results
   T cruzi-infected cultured cardiomyocytes (3:1 multiplicity of infection; 24 hours postinfection) were incubated with betulin (3 mu mol/L per mL), an SREBP inhibitor, for 24 hours. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analyses demonstrated a significant reduction in SREBP activation, lipid biosynthesis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in betulin-treated infected cells compared with untreated cells. T cruzi infected (10(3) trypomastigotes of the Brazil strain) Swiss mice were fed a customized diet containing betulin during the intermediate stage (40 days postinfection) until the chronic stage (120 DPI). Cardiac ultrasound imaging and histological and biochemical analyses demonstrated anatomical and functional improvements in betulin-treated, infected mice compared with untreated controls: we observed a significant reduction in cholesterol/fatty acid synthesis that may result in the observed cardiac reduction in cardiac lipid accumulation, mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and ventricular enlargement.
   Conclusions
   Our study (in vitro and vivo) demonstrates that inhibition of cardiac SREBP activation reduces cardiac damage during T cruzi infection and modulates CCM in a murine Chagas model.

AB  - Background: Triatoma sordida, a vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, is native of Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay, and occurs primarily in peridomiciles. Currently, it is the species most frequently captured by the Chagas Disease Control Program in Brazil. For this reason, population genetic studies attract great interest, as they can provide further information about the dispersal and household invasion processes of this species. In the absence of suitable markers, the objective of this study was to test the cross amplification of microsatellite primers.
   Findings: 23 primers were tested for microsatellite loci already described for other species of the genus Triatoma sp. Forty four specimens of T. sordida captured in the north of Minas Gerais were used to validate the use of standardized loci for population genetic analyses. It was possible to amplify 10 of the 23 loci tested for T. sordida.
   Conclusions: This is the first study that provides 10 microsatellite markers for population analysis of this triatomine species. Cross-amplification of primers can be used among other phylogenetically related species whose loci are already available for study.

AB  - The coati (Nasua nasua, Carnivora) is a medium-sized mammal common in the Pantanal of Brazil. Unlike most mammals, coatis construct arboreal nests used for resting and reproduction. In this region, the coati is an important host of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. There are two possible routes through coatis can be infected by T. cruzi: the oral route or the vectorial route. However, the relative importance of each of these routes in the infection of coatis and its role in the sylvatic cycle of the parasite are unknown. Our objectives were to investigate: (i) whether coati nests were infested by triatomine bugs, (ii) what species were frequent in the nests, (iii) whether the triatomines in nests were infected by T. cruzi, and (iv) what were the food resources of these triatomines. Eight of the 24 nests sampled were infested with triatomines, a total of 37 specimens of at least two species (Rhodnius stali and Triatoma sordida). In one nest, R. stali and T. sordida co-occurred and both fed on multiple resources, including coatis. This is the first report of triatomines occurring in arboreal nests of coatis. The co-occurrence of two different genera of triatomine vectors and coatis within the limited space of the coati nests provide multiple opportunities for the exchange of the protozoan parasite through both the vectorial and oral transmission routes.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, can affect the heart, esophagus and colon. The reasons that some patients develop different clinical forms or remain asymptomatic are unclear. It is believed that tissue immunogenetic markers influence the tropism of T. cruzi for different organs. ABO, Secretor and Lewis histo-blood group systems express a variety of tissue carbohydrate antigens that influence the susceptibility or resistance to diseases. This study aimed to examine the association of ABO, secretor and Lewis histo-blood systems with the clinical forms of Chagas disease. We enrolled 339 consecutive adult patients with chronic Chagas disease regardless of gender (cardiomyopathy: n = 154; megaesophagus: n = 119; megacolon: n = 66). The control group was composed by 488 healthy blood donors. IgG anti-T. cruzi antibodies were detected by ELISA. ABO and Lewis phenotypes were defined by standard hemagglutination tests. Secretor (FUT2) and Lewis (FUT3) genotypes, determined by Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), were used to infer the correct histo-blood group antigens expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. The proportions between groups were compared using the chi(2) test with Yates correction and Fisher's exact test and the Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) were calculated. An alpha error of 5% was considered significant with p-values <0.05 being corrected for multiple comparisons (pc). No statistically significant differences were found for the ABO (X-2: 2.635; p-value = 0.451), Secretor (X-2: 0.056; p-value = 0.812) or Lewis (X-2: 2.092; p-value = 0.351) histo-blood group phenotypes between patients and controls. However, B plus AB Secretor phenotypes were prevalent in pooled data from megaesophagus and megacolon patients (OR: 5.381; 95% CI: 1.230-23.529; p-value= 0.011; pc= 0.022) in comparison to A plus O Secretor phenotypes. The tissue antigen variability resulting from the combined action of ABO and Secretor histo-blood systems is associated with the digestive forms of Chagas disease. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

AB  - Mixed infections with Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma rangeli and their different genetic groups occur frequently in vertebrate hosts and are difficult to detect by serology. In the present study, we evaluated the limit of detection of polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR/RFLP) analysis of cytochrome oxidase II (COII) for the identification of genetic groups of these two parasites in blood and tissue from vertebrate hosts. Reconstitution experiments were performed using human blood (TcI/TcII and KP1+/KP1-) and mouse tissue (TcI/TcII). We tested blood from patients who were in the chronic phase of Chagas disease and tissue from animals that were experimentally infected with all possible combinations of six discrete typing units. In blood samples, T. cruzi and T. rangeli were detected when 5 parasites (pa) were present in the sample, and genetic groups were identified when at least 50 pa were present in the sample. T. cruzi alone could be detected with 1 pa and genotyped (TcI/TcII) with 2 pa. T. rangeli was detected with 2 pa and genotyped (KP+/KP1-) with 25 pa. The present method more readily detected TcII and KP1- in both admixtures and alone. In mouse tissue, TcI and TcII were detected with at least 25 pa. The analysis of blood samples from patients and tissue from animals that were experimentally infected revealed low parasite loads in these hosts, which were below the limit of detection of the present method and could not be genotyped. Our findings indicate that the performance of PCR/RFLP analysis of COII is directly related to the amount and proportion of parasites that are present in the sample and the genetic groups to which the parasites belong.

AB  - Background: In Colombia, Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma dimidiata are the main domestic triatomine species known to transmit T. cruzi. However, there are multiple reports of T. cruzi transmission involving secondary vectors. In this work, we carried out an eco-epidemiological study on Margarita Island, located in the Caribbean region of Colombia, where Chagas disease is associated with non-domiciliated vectors.
   Methods: To understand the transmission dynamics of Trypanosoma cruzi in this area, we designed a comprehensive, multi-faceted study including the following: (i) entomological evaluation through a community-based insect-surveillance campaign, blood meal source determination and T. cruzi infection rate estimation in triatomine insects; (ii) serological determination of T. cruzi prevalence in children under 15 years old, as well as in domestic dogs and synanthropic mammals; (iii) evaluation of T. cruzi transmission capacity in dogs and Didelphis marsupialis, and (iv) genetic characterization of T. cruzi isolates targeting spliced-leader intergene region (SL-IR) genotypes.
   Results: Out of the 124 triatomines collected, 94 % were Triatoma maculata, and 71.6 % of them were infected with T. cruzi. Blood-meal source analysis showed that T. maculata feeds on multiple hosts, including humans and domestic dogs. Serological analysis indicated 2 of 803 children were infected, representing a prevalence of 0.25 %. The prevalence in domestic dogs was 71.6 % (171/224). Domestic dogs might not be competent reservoir hosts, as inferred from negative T. cruzi xenodiagnosis and haemoculture tests. However, 61.5 % (8/13) of D. marsupialis, the most abundant synanthropic mammal captured, were T. cruzi-positive on xenodiagnosis and haemocultures.
   Conclusions: This study reveals the role of peridomestic T. maculata and dogs in T. cruzi persistence in this region and presents evidence that D. marsupialis are a reservoir mediating peridomestic-zoonotic cycles. This picture reflects the complexity of the transmission dynamics of T. cruzi in an endemic area with non-domiciliated vectors where active human infection exists. There is an ongoing need to control peridomestic T. maculata populations and to implement continuous reservoir surveillance strategies with community participation.

AB  - Recurrent outbreaks of oral infection and isolated cases characterize the new epidemiological scenario of Chagas disease (CD) in the Brazilian Amazon. Acute Chagas disease (ACD) is common in Para and Amazonas, Northeastern and Northwestern Brazilian Amazonia. In the present study, we describe the first molecularly characterized autochthonous case of ACD in Rondonia, Southwestern Amazonia. The patient, a 39-year-old male resident in the small city of Cujubim, presented typical ACD symptoms: fever, asthenia, myalgia, progressive dyspnea, swelling of the legs, and tiredness at minimal efforts, all compatible with ACD and indicative of cardiac involvement. A thick blood drop test revealed trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi genotyped as TcIV. An epidemiological investigation ruled out oral infection, and support for vectorial transmission included the finding of Panstrongylus geniculatus positive for T. cruzi (TcIII and TcIV) inside the tent used by the patient when harvesting forest timber, and a circular cutaneous lesion resembling a chagoma of inoculation. Treatment with benznidazole led to blood parasite clearance as confirmed by molecular tests. Altogether, our findings fitted well into the ecological scenario where deforestation and colonization of forested areas represent an important risk factor to the adaptation of P. geniculatus to human habitats, favoring vectorial transmission of CD in the Amazonian region.

AB  - ProblemThe innate immune response of the placenta may participate in the congenital transmission of Chagas disease through releasing reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates.
   Method of studyPlacental explants were cultured with 1x10(6) and 1x10(5) trypomastigotes of Tulahuen and Lucky strains and controls without parasites, and with the addition of nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) as the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger. Detachment of the syncytiotrophoblast (STB) was examined by histological analysis, and the nitric oxide synthase, endothelial (eNOS), and nitrotyrosine expressions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, as well as the human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels in the culture supernatant through ELISA assays. Parasite load with qPCR using Taqman primers was quantified.
   ResultsThe higher number of T. cruzi (10(6)) increased placental infection, eNOS expression, nitrosative stress, and STB detachment, with the placental barrier being injured by oxidative stress.
   ConclusionThe higher number of parasites caused deleterious consequences to the placental barrier, and the inhibitors (l-NAME and NAC) prevented the damage caused by trypomastigotes in placental villi but not that of the infection. Moreover, trophoblast eNOS played a key role in placental infection with the highest inoculum of Lucky, demonstrating the importance of the enzyme and nitrosative-oxidative stress in Chagas congenital transmission.

AB  - Cardiac dysfunction with progressive inflammation and fibrosis is a hallmark of Chagas disease caused by persistent Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Osteopontin (OPN) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that orchestrates mechanisms controlling cell recruitment and cardiac architecture. Our main goal was to study the role of endogenous OPN as a modulator of myocardial CCL5 chemokine and MMP-2 metalloproteinase, and its pathological impact in a murine model of Chagas heart disease. Wild-type (WT) and OPN-deficient (sppl -/-) mice were parasite-infected (Brazil strain) for 100 days. Both groups developed chronic myocarditis with similar parasite burden and survival rates. However, sppl -/- infection showed lower heart-to-body ratio (P < 0.01) as well as reduced inflammatory pathology (P < 0.05), CCL5 expression (P < 0.05), myocyte size (P < 0.05) and fibrosis (P < 0.01) in cardiac tissues. Intense OPN labeling was observed in inflammatory cells recruited to infected heart (P < 0.05). Plasma concentration of MMP-2 was higher (P < 0.05) in infected WT than in sppl -/- mice. Coincidently, specific immunostaining revealed increased gelatinase expression (P < 0.01) and activity (P < 0.05) in the inflamed hearts from T. cruzi WT mice, but not in their sppl -/- littermates. CCL5 and MMP-2 induction occurred preferentially (P < 0.01) in WT heart-invading CDS+ T cells and was mediated via phospho-JNK MAPK signaling. Heart levels of OPN, CCL5 and MMP-2 correlated (P < 0.01) with collagen accumulation in the infected WT group only. Endogenous OPN emerges as a key player in the pathogenesis of chronic Chagas heart disease, through the upregulation of myocardial CCL5/MMP-2 expression and activities resulting in pro-inflammatory and pro-hypertrophic events, cardiac remodeling and interstitial fibrosis.

AB  - Vector transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi occurs in several areas of Brazil, including the northeastern region, and domestic animals can serve as reservoirs of the parasite. The aim of this study was to monitor dogs as domestic reservoirs for infection by T. cruzi, and the main triatomine species involved in parasite transmission in rural areas of municipalities in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, in northeastern, Brazil. Blood samples from dogs (n = 40) and manual triatomine capture were performed in domiciliary and peridomiciliary environments in rural areas of the towns of Acari, Caraubas and Marcelino Vieira, between 2013 and 2016. Subsequently, infection of dogs was determined by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the detection of IgM and IgG isotypes and Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) reactions for detection of IgG. Triatomine infection was determined by PCR. Forty (16/40) percent of the dogs were seropositive for T. cruzi; 20.0% (8/40) of such reactivity indicated the acute phase, and 20.0% (8/40), the chronic phase. PCR was positive in 42.5% (17/40) of the dogs' blood samples. Specimens of Triatoma brasiliensis, Triatoma pseudomaculata, Rhodnius nasutus and Panstrongylus lutzi were found to be infected; however only T. brasiliensis nymphs and adults were infected in both environments. Triatomines evaluation showed 82.5% (94/114) of PCR positivity. Taken together, our results confirm that dogs are domestic reservoirs of T. cruzi in northeastern Brazil and T. brasiliensis is the main triatomine species correlated with parasite transmission in domiciliary environments. There is a continuing need to control peridomiciliary populations of triatomines and to implement continuous surveillance strategies for reservoirs with the help from the community.

AB  - Chagas disease is a neglected disease that remains a public health threat, particularly in Latin America. The most important treatment options are nitroimidazole derivatives, such as nifurtimox and benznidazole (BZN). Some studies suggest that for adults seropositive toT.cruzibut without clinically evident chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), a simple fixed-dose scheme of BZN could be equivalent to a weight-adjusted dose. We compared the efficacy and safety of a fixed dose of BZN with an adjusted dose forT.cruziseropositive adults without CCC. We used the Cochrane methods, and reported according to the PRISMA statement. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) allocating participants to fixed and/or adjusted doses of BZN forT.cruziseropositive adults without CCC. We searched (December 2019) Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, Clinicaltrials.gov, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and contacted Chagas experts. Selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment, using the Cochrane tool, were performed independently by pairs of reviewers. Discrepancies were solved by consensus within the team. Primary outcomes were parasite-related outcomes and efficacy or patient-related safety outcomes. We conducted a meta-analysis using RevMan 5.3 software and used GRADE summary of finding tables to present the certainty of evidence by outcome. We identified 655 records through our search strategy and 10 studies (four of them ongoing) met our inclusion criteria. We did not find any study directly comparing fixed vs adjusted doses of BZN, however, some outcomes allowed subgroup comparisons between fixed and adjusted doses of BZN against placebo. Moderate-certainty evidence suggests no important subgroup differences for positive PCR at one year and for three safety outcomes (drug discontinuation, peripheral neuropathy, and mild rash). The same effect was observed for any serious adverse events (low-certainty evidence). All subgroups showed similar effects (I(2)0% for all these subgroup comparisons but 32% for peripheral neuropathy), supporting the equivalence of BZN schemes. We conclude that there is no direct evidence comparing fixed and adjusted doses of BZN. Based on low to very low certainty of evidence for critical clinical outcomes and moderate certainty of evidence for important outcomes, fixed and adjusted doses may be equivalent in terms of safety and efficacy. An individual patient data network meta-analysis could better address this issue.
   Author summary Chagas disease is a major public health problem that requires, among other control interventions, an optimal trypanocidal therapy that achieves the best possible compliance to cure active infection, mainly in children and young populations, women before they become pregnant to prevent congenital transmission, and chronic populations who are currently not being treated and with a risk of progression to cardiomyopathy. Some studies suggest that a simple fixed-dose scheme of benznidazole could be equivalent to the dose adjusted by weight for the treatment of adults seropositive toT.cruziwithout clinically evident chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. To confirm or reject this potential equivalence of schemes, we conducted a rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials by reviewing and analyzing the totality of available literature on the subject. Although we did not find direct evidence addressing this question, it appears that an adjusted dose is probably equivalent in terms of important safety and efficacy outcomes, while the effect on critical outcomes is uncertain. Since we did not find any ongoing study comparing fixed versus adjusted doses of benznidazole, we are conducting an individual patient data network meta-analysis to address this question.

AB  - Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is endemic in almost all countries of Latin America. In Brazil, oral infection is becoming the most important mechanism of transmission of the disease in several regions of the country. The gastrointestinal tract is the gateway for the parasite through this route of infection, however, little is known about the involvement of these organs related to oral route. In this sense, the present study evaluated the impact of oral infection on the digestive tract in mice infected by Berenice-78 (Be-78) T. cruzi strain, in comparison with the intraperitoneal route of infection. In this work, the intraperitoneal route group showed a peak of parasitemia similar to the oral route group, however the mortality rate among the orally infected animals was higher when compared to intraperitoneal route. By analyzing the frequency of blood cell populations, differences were mainly observed in CD4(+) T lymphocytes, and not in CD8(+)' presenting an earlier reduction in the number of CD4(+) T cells, which persisted for a longer period, in the animals of the oral group when compared with the intraperitoneal group. Animals infected by oral route presented a higher tissue parasitism and inflammatory infiltrate in stomach, duodenum and colon on the 28th day after infection. Therefore, these data suggest that oral infection has a different profile of parasitological and immune responses compared to intraperitoneal route, being the oral mute more virulent and with greater tissue parasitism in organs of the gastrointestinal tract evaluated during the acute phase.

AB  - The occurrence of triatomine species, their bloodmeal sources and the discrete typing units (DTUs) of Trypanosoma cruzi isolated from them were determined in different municipalities of the state of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Triatomine captures were carried out in the rural areas of 23 municipalities. The genotyping of T. cruzi isolates was performed using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2 (coii) gene, the D7 region of the 24S alpha rDNA, and the spliced leader intergenic region (SL-IR). Five triatomine species were captured, and the most frequent was Triatoma brasiliensis (84.3%; 916/1086), which was found in 16 of the 23 municipalities surveyed, and infested all types of environment investigated. The TcI DTU was found in all mesoregions surveyed in 51.5% (17/33) of the culture-positive samples. In contrast, TcII (9.1%; 3/33) was detected in the Central mesoregion, while TcIII (27.3%; 9/33) was found in all mesoregions. The geographic distribution and spatial overlap of different DTUs was inferred using the superposition of the radius of occurrence of isolates and using ecological niche distribution modelling. Triatoma brasiliensis was found infected in all mesoregions and with all three T. cruzi DTUs, including mixed infections. With regard to bloodmeal sources, the DNA of rodents was found in triatomines infected with either TcI or TcIII, while that of domestic animals and humans was associated with both single and mixed infections. Our findings demonstrate that different DTUs of T. cruzi are widely dispersed among triatomines in our study area. The association of T. brasiliensis with several different mammalian hosts, as well as overlapping areas with different DTUs, suggests that this triatomine species may have an important role as a vector in both anthropic and sylvatic environments.

AB  - Chagas disease is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. In endemic areas (South and Central America), Chagas disease represents a relevant public health issue, and is the most frequent cause of cardiomyopathy. In nonendemic areas, such as Europe, Chagas disease represents an emerging problem following the establishment of sizeable communities from Brazil and Bolivia. Chagas cardiomyopathy represents the most frequent and serious complication of chronic Chagas disease, affecting about 20-30% of patients, potentially leading to heart failure, arrhythmias, thromboembolism, stroke and sudden death. Because late complications of Chagas disease may develop several years or even decades after the acute infection, it may be extremely challenging to reach the correct diagnosis in patients long removed from the countries of origin. We report two examples of Chagas cardiomyopathy in South American women permanently residing in Italy for more than 20 years, presenting with cardiac manifestations ranging from left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure to isolated ventricular arrhythmias. The present review emphasizes that Chagas disease should be considered as a potential diagnosis in patients from endemic areas presenting with idiopathic' cardiac manifestations, even when long removed from their country of origin, with potential implications for treatment and control of Chagas disease transmission.

AB  - Chagas disease affects between six and seven million people. Its etiological agent, Trypanosoma cruzi, is classified into six discrete typing units (DTUs). The biological study of 11 T. cruzi strains presented here included four parameters: growth kinetics, parasitemia curves, rate of macrophage infection, and serology to evaluate IgM, total IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG3. Sequencing of small subunit of ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) was performed and the T. cruzi strains were classified into three DTUs. When their growth in liver infusion tryptose medium was represented in curves, differences among the strains could be noted. The parasitemia profile varied among the strains from the TcI, TcII, and TcIII groups, and the 11 T. cruzi strains produced distinct parasitemia levels in infected BALB/c. The TcI group presented the highest rate of macrophage infection by amastigotes, followed by TcII and TcIII. Reactivity to immunoglobulins was observed in the TcI, TcII, and TcIII; all the animals infected with the different strains of T. cruzi showed anti-T. cruzi antibodies. The molecular study presented here resulted in the classification of the T. cruzi strains into the TcI (Bolivia, T lenti, Tm, SC90); TcII (Famema, SC96, SI8, Y); and TcIII (QMM3, QMM5, SI5) groups. These biological and molecular results from 11 T. cruzi strains clarified the factors involved in the biology of the parasite and its hosts. The collection of triatomine (vector) species, and the study of geographic distribution, as well as biological and molecular characterization of the parasite, will contribute to the reporting and surveillance measures in Brazilian states.

AB  - This review article compiles in a critical manner literature publications regarding seven neglected diseases (ND) prioritized in Brazil (Chagas disease, dengue, leishmaniasis, leprosy, malaria, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis) under the perspective of metabolomics. Both strategies, targeted and untargeted metabolomics, were considered in the compilation. The majority of studies focused on biomarker discovery for diagnostic purposes, and on the search of novel or alternative therapies against the ND under consideration, although temporal progression of the infection at metabolic level was also addressed. Tuberculosis, followed by schistosomiasis, malaria and leishmaniasis are the diseases that received larger attention in terms of number of publications. Dengue and leprosy were the least studied and Chagas disease received intermediate attention. NMR and HPLC-MS technologies continue to predominate among the analytical platforms of choice in the metabolomic studies of ND. A plethora of metabolites were identified in the compiled studies, with expressive predominancy of amino acids, organic acids, carbohydrates, nucleosides, lipids, fatty acids, and derivatives.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi Trypanothione Reductase (TcTR) is one of the therapeutic targets studied in the development of new drugs against Chagas' disease. Due to its biodiversity, Brazil has several compounds of natural origin that were not yet properly explored in drug discovery. Therefore, we employed the Virtual Screening against TcTR aiming to discover new inhibitors from the Natural Products Database of the Bahia Semi-Arid region (NatProDB). This database has a wide chemical diversity favoring the discovery of new chemical entities. Subsequently, we analyzed the best docking conformations using self-organizing maps (AuPosSOM) aiming to verify their interaction sites at TcTR. Finally, the Pred-hERG, the Aggregator Advisor, the FAF-DRUGS and the pkCSM results allowed us to evaluate, respectively, the cardiotoxicity, aggregation capacity, presence of false positives (PAINS) and its toxicity. Thus, we selected three molecules that could be tested in in vitro assays in the hope that the computational results reported here would favor the development of new anti-chagasic drugs.

AB  - Triatoma virus occurs infecting Triatominae in the wild (Argentina) and in insectaries (Brazil). Pathogenicity of Triatoma virus has been demonstrated in laboratory; accidental infections in insectaries produce high insect mortality. When more than one microorganism enters the same host, the biological interaction among them differs greatly depending on the nature and the infection order of the co-existing species of microorganisms. We studied the possible interactions between Triatoma virus (TrV) and Trypanosoma cruzi (the etiological agent of Chagas disease) in three different situations: (i) when Triatoma virus is inoculated into an insect host (Triatoma infestans) previously infected with T. cruzi, (ii) when T. cruzi is inoculated into T. infestans previously infected with TrV, and (iii) when TrV and T. cruzi are inoculated simultaneously into the same T. infestans individual. Trypanosoma cruzi infection was found in 57% of insects in the control group for T. cruzi, whereas 85% of insects with previous TrV infection were infected with T. cruzi. TrV infection was found in 78.7% of insects in the control group for TrV, whereas insects previously infected with T. cruzi showed 90% infection with TrV. A total of 67.9% of insects presented simultaneous infection with both types of microorganism. Our results suggest that TrV infection could increase adhesion of T. cruzi to the intestinal cells of triatomines, but presence of T. cruzi in intestinal cells would not increase the possibility of entry of TrV into cells. Although this study cannot explain the mechanism through which TrV facilitates the infection of triatomines with T. cruzi, we conclude that after TrV replication, changes at cellular level should occur that increase the adhesion of T. cruzi.

AB  - Background
   Blood donors unaware of Trypanosoma cruzi infection may donate infectious blood. Risk factors and the presence of T. cruzi antibodies in at-risk Dutch blood donors were studied to assess whether specific blood safety measures are warranted in the Netherlands.
   Methodology
   Birth in a country endemic for Chagas disease (CEC), having a mother born in a CEC, or having resided for at least six continuous months in a CEC were considered risk factors for T. cruzi infection. From March through September 2013, risk factor questions were asked to all donors who volunteered to donate blood or blood components. Serum samples were collected from donors reporting one or more risk factors, and screened for IgG antibodies to T. cruzi by EIA.
   Results
   Risk factors for T. cruzi infection were reported by 1,426 of 227,278 donors (0.6%). Testing 1,333 at-risk donors, none (0.0%; 95%, CI 0.0-0.4%) was seroreactive for IgG antibodies to T. cruzi. A total of 472 donors were born in a CEC; 553 donors reported their mother being born in a CEC; and 1,121 donors reported a long-term stay in a CEC. The vast majority of reported risk factors were related to Suriname and Brazil. Overall, the participants resided for 7,694 years in CECs, which equals 2.8 million overnight stays. Of those, 1.9 million nights were spent in Suriname.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Asymptomatic T. cruzi infection appears to be extremely rare among Dutch blood donors. Blood safety interventions to mitigate the risk of T. cruzi transmission by transfusion would be highly cost-ineffective in the Netherlands, and are thus not required.

AB  - Background/Methodology
   Triatomine bugs are the vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease. Vector control has for decades relied upon insecticide spraying, but insecticide resistance has recently emerged in several triatomine populations. One alternative strategy to reduce T. cruzi transmission is paratransgenesis, whereby symbiotic bacteria are genetically engineered to produce T. cruzi-killing proteins in the vector's gut. This approach requires in-depth knowledge of the vectors' natural gut microbiota. Here, we use metagenomics (16S rRNA 454 pyrosequencing) to describe the gut microbiota of field-caught Triatoma sordida +/- likely the most common peridomestic triatomine in Brazil. For large nymphs (4 th and 5 th stage) and adults, we also studied separately the three main digestive-tract segments-anterior midgut, posterior midgut, and hindgut.
   Principal findings
   Bacteria of four phyla (12 genera) were present in both nymphs (all five stages) and adults, thus defining T. sordida's 'bacterial core': Actinobacteria (Brevibacterium, Corynebacterium, Dietzia, Gordonia, Nitriliruptor, Nocardia, Nocardiopsis, Rhodococcus, and Williamsia), Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas and Sphingobium), and Firmicutes (Staphylococcus). We found some clear differences in bacterial composition and relative abundance among development stages; overall, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria increased, but Actinobacteria decreased, through development. Finally, the bacterial microbiotas of the bugs' anterior midgut, posterior midgut, and hindgut were sharply distinct.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our results identify the 'bacterial core set' of T. sordida and reveal important gut microbiota differences among development stages-particularly between 1st-3rd stage nymphs and adults. Further, we show that, within any given development stage, the vectors' gut cannot be regarded as a single homogeneous environment. Cultivable, non-pathogenic 'core' bacterial species may now be tested as candidates for paratransgenic control of T. cruzi transmission by T. sordida.

AB  - Panstrongylus megistus is considered one of the primary species of epidemiological importance for the transmission of Chagas disease in Brazil due to its wide geographical distribution throughout the national territory, good ability to invade and colonize houses, and high rates of natural infection by the Trypanosoma cruzi. The importance of this species in Minas Gerais has been recognized since the 80s. It is responsible for the high prevalence rates of Chagas disease in the west of the state. Studies conducted in the municipality of Jaboticatubas show that P. megistus is still the most captured vector in the region, even after 40 years of uninterrupted actions of the Chagas Disease Control Program in the municipality. Despite the importance of the species, its population dynamics is little studied. Consequently, crucial genetic information such as genetic diversity and gene flow among environments have not been well characterized yet. In this context, this work presents a population genetic analysis at the microgeographic level using microsatellite markers in samples of P. megistus obtained from Jaboticatubas to better understand the infestation dynamics of the primary vector species of T. cruzi in the region. The observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.26 to 0.47 and 0.47 to 0.65, respectively. Most loci presented Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium due to the excess of homozygotes. The pairwise Fst ranged from 0.05 to 0.35, with the p value significant for all comparisons, indicating the absence of gene flow between them. The values of Fis found ranged from 0.25 to 0.52, all values of p <= 0.05, probably due to structured populations, inbreeding, or null alleles. The results suggest an extended stay of this species in the colonized environments, with rare dispersal to other locations. Such results differ from that observed for Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma dimidiata, species that present constant movement, even after colonization of the artificial environment, and are similar to the behavior of Triatoma infestans. Thus, the study reinforces the importance of continuous entomological surveillance in the areas of occurrence of P. megistus to avoid the installation and formation of new foci of household infestation in the region.

AB  - The aim of this study was to detect the infection by Trypanosoma cruzi in captive Neotropical primates in the Brazilian Amazon. From February 2013 to July 2014, 112 blood samples were collected from Neotropical primates from the Amazonas, Amapa, and Para States, north of Brazil. The subjects belonged to the families Cebidae (N = 59), Atelidae (N = 41), Callitrichidae (N = 5), Pitheciidae (N = 4), and Aotidae (N = 3). Blood smears also were examined for the presence of trypomastigotes by optical microscopy. For the detection of T. cruzi DNA, a Nested-PCR with primers TCZ1/TCZ2 and TCZ3/TCZ4 was performed. T. cruzi DNA was detected in 12.5% (14/112) of Neotropical primates examined. Positive samples were detected in 16%, 12.5%, and 11.11% of the different species of primates sampled from the Amapa, Para, and Amazonas states, respectively. The analysis of the blood smears did not reveal trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. In conclusion, Neotropical primates kept in captivity were infected by T. cruzi in the studied areas. We recommend that a health management protocol be put into place to prevent the transmission of infectious agents among captive populations, captive and wild populations, and between NHPs and the technicians who handle these animals.

AB  - The taxon Trypanosoma cruzi, causative agent of Chagas disease, is composed of several discrete typing units (DTUs) named TcI-TcVI, and Tcbat. The history of the taxon T. cruzi is known, even though several controversial aspects remain as the relationships between TcIII and TcIV. We analyzed cloned T. cruzi stocks pertaining to the seven DTUs by filter hybridization tests of PCR amplicons from minicircle variable regions and kinetoplast DNA probes. Minicircle DNA blots from the cloned stocks and filter hybridization with one TcI, one TcII, one TcV, one TcVI, three TcIII, one TcIV from North America and one TcIV kinetoplast DNA probes from South America revealed minicircle variable region cross-reaction in some T. cruzi DTUs probed. TcIII was heterogeneous in minicircle class composition, even though two TcIII probes revealed that a small fraction of minicircles cross hybridized with the minicircles from the TcIII, TcV and TcVI DTUs. The minicircles of TcIV from North America cross-reacted only with TcIV from North America but not with TcIV stocks from Brazil and Bolivia. The results on minicircle cross-hybridizations are discussed in the context of RNA editing, mitochondrial function in T. cruzi DTUs. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The underlying pathogenic mechanisms of cardiomyopathy in Chagas disease are still unsolved. In order to better clarify the role of fat on the evolution of cardiomyopathy, the present study employed three murine models of chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection: (1) aP2-RID alpha/beta transgenic mice (RID mice; an adipose tissue model which express a gain-of-function potent anti-inflammatory activity), (2) allograft inflammatory factor-1 knockout mice (Aif1(-/-)), and (3) a Swiss outbred mice. RID mice and non-transgenic mice (wild type, WT) were infected with blood trypomastigotes of Brazil strain. During the acute stage of infection, RID mice had lower parasitemia, lower heart inflammation, and a decrease in the relative distribution of parasite load from cardiac muscle tissue toward epididymal fat. Nevertheless, comparable profiles of myocardial inflammatory infiltrates and relative distribution of parasite load were observed among RID and WT at the chronic stage of infection. Aif1(-/-) and Aif1(+/+) mice were infected with bloodstream trypomastigotes of Tulahuen strain and fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or regular diet (RD). Interestingly, Aif1(+/+) HFD infected mice showed the highest mortality. Swiss mice infected with blood trypomastigotes of Berenice-78 strain on a HFD had higher levels of TNF alpha and more inflammation in their heart tissue than infected mice fed a RD. These various murine models implicate adipocytes in the pathogenesis of chronic Chagas disease and suggest that HFD can lead to a significant increase in the severity of parasite-induced chronic cardiac damage. Furthermore, these data implicate adipocyte TLR4-, TNF alpha-, and IL-1 beta-mediated signaling in pro-inflammatory pathways and Aif-1 gene expression in the development of chronic Chagas disease.

AB  - A relevant issue in Chagas disease serological diagnosis regards the requirement of using several confirmatory methods to elucidate the status of non-negative results from blood bank screening. The development of a single reliable method may potentially contribute to distinguish true and false positive results. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of the multiplexed flow-cytometry anti-T. cruzi/Leishmania IgG1 serology/(FC-TRIPLEX Chagas/Leish IgG1) with three conventional confirmatory criteria (ELISA-EIA, Immunofluorescence assay-IIF and EIA/IIF consensus criterion) to define the final status of samples with actual/previous non-negative results during anti-T. cruzi ELISA-screening in blood banks. Apart from inconclusive results, the FC-TRIPLEX presented a weak agreement index with EIA, while a strong agreement was observed when either IIF or EIA/IIF consensus criteria were applied. Discriminant analysis and Spearman's correlation further corroborates the agreement scores. ROC curve analysis showed that FC-TRIPLEX performance indexes were higher when IIF and EIA/IIF consensus were used as a confirmatory criterion. Logistic regression analysis further demonstrated that the probability of FC-TRIPLEX to yield positive results was higher for inconclusive results from IIF and EIA/IIF consensus. Machine learning tools illustrated the high level of categorical agreement between FC-TRIPLEX versus IIF or EIA/IIF consensus. Together, these findings demonstrated the usefulness of FC-TRIPLEX as a tool to elucidate the status of non-negative results in blood bank screening of Chagas disease.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is an old neglected problem that affects more than 6 million people through 21 endemic countries in Latin America. Despite being responsible for more than 12 thousand deaths per year, the disease disposes basically of two drugs for its treatment, the nitroimidazole benznidazole and the nitrofuran nifurtimox. However, these drugs have innumerous limitations that greatly reduce the chances of cure. In Brazil, for example, only benznidazole is available to treat CD patients. Therefore, some proof-of-concept phase II clinical trials focused on improving the current treatment with benznidazole, also comparing it with repositioned drugs or combining them. Indeed, repositioning already marketed drugs in view of combating neglected tropical diseases is a very interesting approach in the context of decreased time for approval, better treatment options and low cost for development and implementation. After the introduction of human immunodeficiency virus aspartyl peptidase inhibitors (HIV-PIs) in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the prevalence and incidence of parasitic, fungal and bacterial co-infections suffered a marked reduction, making these HIV-PIs attractive for drug repositioning. In this line, the present perspective presents the promising and beneficial data concerning the effects of HIV-PIs on the clinically relevant forms of Trypanosoma cruzi (i.e., trypomastigotes and amastigotes) and also highlights the ultrastructural and physiological targets for the HIV-PIs on this parasite. Therefore, we raise the possibility that HIV-PIs could be considered as alternative treatment options in the struggle against CD.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas disease is a health problem that affects approximately 7 million people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Vector transmission is one of the most important routes in South and Central American countries. Between 2013 and 2019, municipalities of Sergipe sent 507 triatomines for analysis, unveiling the largest records found in the south in the villages of Po?o da Clara, Alagoinhas and Pil?es, and the municipality of Tobias Barreto. The high prevalence of infected vectors in these localities motivated this epidemiological study. Methods: After educational lectures on the vectors and risks of the disease, a structured questionnaire was administered to identify areas and risk factors for transmission of the parasite. The data guided the collection of vectors and blood samples from domestic reservoirs. Results: The studied region is considered endemic for triatomines infected by Trypanosoma cruzi with three species of vectors; the highest prevalence was Panstrongylus lutzi (54.83%), followed by Triatoma pseudomaculata (43.54%), and Triatoma tibiamaculata (1.61%). In the villages in this study, 100% of the vectors were found intradomically. The coexistence of residents with domestic animals was reported by 62.04% (255) of those surveyed. Forty-one small animals that were actively living with humans at home in the localities were evaluated serologically. No infection was observed in the domestic animals. Conclusions: There are favorable conditions for the domiciliation of triatomines in the evaluated locations, contributing to the risk of vectorial transmission of Chagas disease.

AB  - Strains of Trypanosoma cruzi, etiological agent of Chagas disease, are classified into different discrete typing units that may present distinct dynamics of infection and susceptibility to benznidazole (BZ) treatment. Mice that were orally inoculated with T. cruzi IV strains exhibited a more intense course of infection compared with intraperitoneally inoculated mice, reflected by higher parasite loads. We evaluated the efficacy of BZ treatment in Swiss mice that were inoculated with T. cruzi IV strains from the Western Brazilian Amazon. The mice were orally (OR) or intraperitoneally (IP) inoculated with 2 x 10(6) culture-derived metacyclic trypomastigotes of the AM14, AM16, AM64, and AM69 strains of T. cruzi that were obtained from two outbreaks of orally acquired acute Chagas disease in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. The animals were treated with BZ (100 mg/kg/day for 20 days). Fresh blood examination, hemoculture, conventional and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to monitor the therapeutic effects of BZ. Significant reductions in five of 24 parameters of parasitemia and parasite load were found in different tissues in the OR group, indicating worse response to BZ treatment compared with the IP group, in which significant reductions in nine of those 24 parameters were observed. The cure rates in the OR groups ranged from 18.2% (1/11) to 75.0% (9/12) and in the IP groups from 58.3% (7/12) to 91.7% (11/12), for the AM14 and AM69 strains, respectively. These findings indicate that treatment with BZ had fewer beneficial effects with regard to reducing parasitemia and parasite load in different tissues of mice that were OR inoculated with four TcIV strains compared with IP inoculation. Therefore, the route of infection with T. cruzi should be considered when evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of BZ in patients with Chagas disease.

AB  - Background/Methods
   In a pioneering cross-sectional study among Bolivian immigrants in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, the epidemiological profile, clinical manifestations and morbidity of Chagas disease were described. The feasibility of the management of Chagas disease at primary healthcare clinics using a biomedical and psychosocial interdisciplinary approach was also tested. Previously, a Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) infection rate of 4.4% among 633 immigrants was reported. The samples were screened using two commercial enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) tests generated with epimastigote antigens, and those with discrepant or seropositive results were analyzed by confirmatory tests: indirect immunofluorescence (IFI), TESA-blot and a commercial recombinant ELISA. PCR and blood cultures were performed in seropositive patients.
   Results
   The majority of the 28 seropositive patients were women, of whom 88.89% were of childbearing age. The predominant clinical forms of Chagas disease were the indeterminate and atypical cardiac forms. Less than 50% received the recommended antiparasitic treatment of benznidazole. An interdisciplinary team was centered on primary healthcare physicians who applied guidelines for the management of patients. Infectologists, cardiologists, pediatricians and other specialists acted as reference professionals. Confirmatory serology and molecular biology tests, as well as echocardiography, Holter and other tests, were performed for the assessment of affected organs in secondary healthcare centers. The published high performance of two commercial ELISA tests was not confirmed.
   Conclusion
   An interdisciplinary approach including antiparasitic treatment is feasible at the primary healthcare level for the management of Chagas disease in Bolivian immigrants. The itinerant feature of immigration was associated with a lack of adherence to antiparasitic treatment and was considered a main challenge for the clinical management of this population. This approach is recommended for management of the infected population in endemic and nonendemic areas, although different strategies are needed depending on the severity of the disease and the structure of the healthcare system.

AB  - The main strategy of interrupting Trypanossoma cruzi transmission is to control the vector populations. Studies of new agents with activity against these vectors have a priority interest. This study evaluated the insecticidal activity of the essential oil of Myrciaria floribunda against nymphs of R. prolixus. M. floribunda was collected in Jurubatiba Sandbank (southeastern Brazil). Leaves were extracted by hydrodistillation and the essential oil analyzed by mass spectrometry and flame ionization gas chromatography. The pure essential oil at various dilutions or purified 1,8-cineole was topically applied to R. prolixus. Sesquiterpenes were the main group detected followed by monoterpenes. M. floribunda essential oil, but not 1,8-cineole, significantly increased mortality and disrupted metamorphosis. Overaged nymphs and juvenoid-like insects were also observed. Our data indicate the special metabolites in the essential oil of M. floribunda as promising candidates for studying insecticidal activity and for use as environmentally friendly control compounds to Chagas disease vectors.

AB  - Genetic factors and the immunologic response have been suggested to determine the susceptibility against the infection and the outcome of Chagas disease. In the present study, we analysed three IL17A genetic variants (rs4711998, rs8193036 and rs2275913) regarding the predisposition to Trypanosoma cruzi infection and the development of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) in different Latin American populations. A total of 2,967 individuals from Colombia, Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil, were included in this study. The individuals were classified as seronegative and seropositive for T. cruzi antigens, and this last group were divided into asymptomatic and CCC. For T. cruzi infection susceptibility, the IL17A rs2275913*A showed a significant association in a fixed-effect meta-analysis after a Bonferroni correction (P = 0.016, OR = 1.21, 95%CI = 1.06-1.41). No evidence of association was detected when comparing CCC vs. asymptomatic patients. However, when CCC were compared with seronegative individuals, it showed a nominal association in the meta-analysis (P.= 0.040, OR = 1.20, 95%CI = 1.01-1.45). For the IL17A rs4711998 and rs8193036, no association was observed. In conclusion, our results suggest that IL17A rs2275913 plays an important role in the susceptibility to T. cruzi infection and could also be implicated in the development of chronic cardiomyopathy in the studied Latin American population.

AB  - The review article presents some of the history of how paleoparasitology started in Brazil, making highlight the great responsible Dr. Luiz Fernando Ferreira and Dr. Adauto Araujo, the trajectory of paleoparasitology in Brazil since 1978 and its performance in science to the present day. In sequence, it is made a presentation of parasitological findings on human remains found in archaeological sites in South America, highlighting Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Peru, where major discoveries have occurred. Many of the parasites found in archaeological material and mentioned in this review went out of Africa with the peopling of Europe and from there they dispersed around the world, where climatic conditions allow the transmission. However, humans have acquired other parasites of animals, since humans invaded new habitats or creating new habits adopting new technologies, thus expanding its range of influence on the environment. Thus, this review article is finalized with information that explain the importance of these findings in the interaction between parasites, human host, and ambient.

AB  - Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and transmitted mainly by members of the subfamily Triatominae. There are currently 157 species, grouped into 18 genera and five tribes. Most descriptions of triatomine species are based on classical taxonomy. Facing evolutionary (cryptic speciation and phenotypic plasticity) and taxonomic (more than 190 synonymizations) problems, it is evident that integrative taxonomy studies are an important and necessary trend for this group of vectors. Almost two-and-a-half centuries after the description of the first species, we present for the first time the state-of-the-art taxonomy of the whole subfamily, covering from the initial classic studies to the use of integrative taxonomy.

AB  - The SaMi-Trop project is a cohort study conducted in 21 municipalities of endemic areas of Chagas disease, including 1,959 patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy. In this article we updated the results of the project, adding information from the second cohort visit. Trypanosoma cruzi-seropositive patients were enrolled from the primary care Telehealth service in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The eligibility criterium for the second visit was the participation in the baseline evaluation. Of 1,959 participants at the baseline assessment, 1,585 (79.9%) returned after two years for the second evaluation. The mortality rate was 6.7%, but varied from 0.9% to 18.2% when it was stratified by certain clinical characteristics. A lower age-adjusted NT-Pro-BNP level (less than 300) and a prior benznidazole treatment were associated with lower mortality. There was an improvement in most quality of life domain scores. Participants have also reported fewer signs and symptoms and greater use of medication. The second follow-up visit will be complete in Oct 2021.

AB  - Background: Congenital Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi that must cross the placental barrier during transmission. The trophoblast constitutes the first tissue in contact with the maternal-blood circulating parasite. Importantly, the congenital transmission rates are low, suggesting the presence of local placental defense mechanisms. On the other hand, the placenta is considered an immune regulatory organ since it acts as a modulator of fetal and maternal immune responses. We have previously proposed that local placental factors, such as the epithelial turnover of the trophoblast and the innate immune response initiated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), might prevent parasite infection and congenital transmission. Here, we studied in an ex vivo infected human placental chorionic villi explant HPCVE model, the relationship between TLR-2 activation in response to T. cruzi trypomastigotes, the secreted profile of cytokines, the integrity of the placental barrier and the expression of trophoblast turnover markers.
   Results: TLR-2 inhibition increases the parasite induced histopathological damage, prevents secretion of IL-6 and IL-10, decreases expression of PCNA (proliferation marker) and of beta-hCG (differentiation marker) while increasing caspase 3 activity (cell death marker).
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that TLR-2 is not only involved in the local secretion of cytokines but also regulates, at least partially, the trophoblast turnover. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - After obtaining certification of the absence of transmission of the Trypanosoma cruzi by Triatoma infestans in 2006, other native species of protozoan vectors have been found in human dwellings within municipalities of the State of Parana, Southern Brazil. However, the spatial distribution of T. cruzi vectors and how climatic and landscape combined variables explain the distribution are still poorly understood. The goal of this study was to predict the potential distribution of T. cruzi vectors as a proxy for Chagas disease transmission risk using Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) based on climatic and landscape variables. We hypothesize that ENM based on both climate and landscape variables are more powerful than climate-only or landscape-only models, and that this will be true independent of vector species. A total of 2,662 records of triatomines of five species were obtained by community-based entomological surveillance from 2007 to 2013. The species with the highest number of specimens was Panstrongylus megistus (73%; n = 1,943), followed by Panstrongylus geniculatus (15.4%; 411), Rhodnius neglectus (6.0%; 159), Triatoma sordida (4.5%; 119) and Rhodnius prolixus (1.1%; 30). Of the total, 71.9% were captured at the intradomicile. T. cruzi infection was observed in 19.7% of the 2,472 examined insects. ENMs were generated based on selected climate and landscape variables with 1 km(2) spatial resolution. Zonal statistics were used for classifying the municipalities as to the risk of occurrence of synanthropic triatomines. The integrated analysis of the climate and landscape suitability on triatomines geographical distribution was powerful on generating good predictive models. Moreover, this showed that some municipalities in the northwest, north and northeast of the Parana state have a higher risk of T. cruzivector transmission. This occurs because those regions present high climatic and landscape suitability values for occurrence of their vectors. The frequent invasion of houses by infected triatomines clearly indicates a greater risk of transmission of T. cruzi to the inhabitants. More public health attention should be given in the northern areas of the State of Parana, which presents high climate and landscape suitabilities for the disease vectors. In conclusion, our results through spatial analysis and predictive maps showed to be effective in identifying areas of potential distribution and, consequently, in the definition of strategic areas and actions to prevent new cases of Chagas' disease, reinforcing the need for continuous and robust surveillance in these areas.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, a human protozoan parasite, is the causative agent of Chagas disease. Currently the species is divided into six taxonomic groups. The genome of the CL Brener clone has been estimated to be 106.4 +/- 110.7 Mb, and DNA content analyses revealed that it is a diploid hybrid clone. Trypanosoma rangeli is a hemoflagellate that has the same reservoirs and vectors as T. cruzi; however, it is non-pathogenic to vertebrate hosts. The haploid genome of T. rangeli was previously estimated to be 24 Mb. The parasitic strains of T. rangeli are divided into KP1(+) and KP1(-). Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the DNA content in different strains of T. cruzi and T. rangeli by flow cytometry. All T. cruzi and T. rangeli strains yielded cell cycle profiles with clearly identifiable G1-0 (2n) and G2-M (4n) peaks. T. cruzi and T. rangeli genome sizes were estimated using the clone CL Brener and the Leishmania major CC1 as reference cell lines because their genome sequences have been previously determined. The DNA content of T. cruzi strains ranged from 87,41 to 108,16 Mb, and the DNA content of T. rangeli strains ranged from 63,25 Mb to 68,66 Mb. No differences in DNA content were observed between KP1(+) and KP1(-) T. rangeli strains. Cultures containing mixtures of the epimastigote forms of T. cruzi and T. rangeli strains resulted in cell cycle profiles with distinct G1 peaks for strains of each species. These results demonstrate that DNA content analysis by flow cytometry is a reliable technique for discrimination between T. cruzi and T. rangeli isolated from different hosts.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease control programmes have decreased the prevalence of Chagas disease in Latin America. Together with migration to urban areas and increase in life expectancy, a new scenario for Chagas disease has emerged in Brazil with most patients currently elderly individuals living in urban areas. However, acute Chagas disease cases still occur due to vector transmission by sylvatic vectors and oral transmission by contaminated food. Therefore, we characterized the clinical and epidemiological profile of the patients followed at Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We aimed to identify the clinical forms, associated co-morbidities, and geographical areas where younger patients originate from. This will aid in the identification of potential challenges to be currently faced.
   Results: This is a cross-sectional study. Adult patients with chronic Chagas disease were recruited between March 2013 and April 2016. Clinical and epidemiological data were obtained from electronic medical records and interviews. The clinical form of the Chagas disease presented by the patients was determined following the Brazilian Consensus on Chagas disease. Six hundred and nineteen patients (mean age 60 +/- 12 years; 56.9% women) were included in this study. Patients' clinical forms were classified as follows: indeterminate 29.1%; cardiac 55.4%; digestive 5.5%; and mixed 10.0%. Patients aged over 65 years comprised 38% of the population. Hypertension was present in 347 (56%) patients, dyslipidemia in 261 patients (42%) and diabetes mellitus in 185 patients (30%). There were no differences regarding gender, race, comorbidities frequency or place of origin across Chagas disease clinical forms. Most of the elderly population originated from Bahia, Minas Gerais and Pernambuco states, while most of the younger patients were born in Ceara, Paraiba and Rio de Janeiro states.
   Conclusions: We described a great proportion of elderly patients in the composition of an urban Brazilian Chagas disease patient cohort with a high prevalence of comorbidities. We also identified a change in the pattern of the place of origin among younger patients.

AB  - Neglected tropical diseases (NTD) are a group of 17 diseases transmitted by virus, protozoa, helminthes and bacteria. These illnesses are responsible for millions of deaths per year, affecting mainly the poorest populations in the world. The therapeutic drugs available are obsolete, toxic, have questionable efficacy and there are reports of resistance. Therefore, the discovery of new, safe, effective and affordable active molecules is urgently needed. Considering that, the main purpose of this mini-review is to show the current scenario concerning drug design for neglected disease in Brazil. NTD are a very broad topic. Thus, we selected four infections for discussion: Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, malaria and tuberculosis. According to CNPq (National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development) directories, there are many Brazilian groups studying these respective diseases. The papers published possess high quality and some of them, the most recent, are briefly discussed here. Medicinal chemistry approaches such as synthesis of novel series of molecules and biological activity evaluation, studies of structure-activity relationships (qualitative and quantitative), molecular modeling calculations and electrochemistry are some of the tools applied in the design of the compounds.

AB  - Background Chagas disease is endemic in Latin America and still represents an important public health problem in the region. Chronic cardiomyopathy is the most significant chronic form due to its association with morbidity and mortality. The last decade has seen increasing evidence that inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are responsible for the generation of inflammatory infiltrate and tissue damage, with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy patients presenting a pro-inflammatory immune response. Although studies have evaluated the role of chemokines in experimental T. cruzi infection, few have addressed their systemic profile, especially for human infection and in aging populations. The present work aimed to use the data from a large population based study of older adults, conducted in an endemic area for Chagas disease, to examine the association between serum levels of cytokines and chemokines, T. cruzi infection and electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality. Methods The present work evaluated serum levels of CCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL5, CXCL8, IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF, IL-12 and IL-10 by Flow Cytometric Bead Array assay (CBA) and the results expressed in pg/ml. The baseline survey started in January 1st 1997, with 1284 participants of an aged population-based cohort. Participants signed an informed consent at baseline and at each subsequent visit and authorized death certificate and medical records verification. Results Our results demonstrated that Chagas disease patients had higher serum levels of CXCL9, CXCL10 and IL-1 beta and lower serum levels of CCL5 than non-infected subjects. Moreover, our data demonstrated that CXCL9 and CXCL10 increased in an age-dependent profile in Chagas disease patients. Conclusion Together, this study provided evidences that serum biomarkers increase along the age continuum and may have potential implications for establishing clinical management protocols and therapeutic intervention in Chagas disease patients.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) poses a major public health challenge for the Americas and non endemic regions around the world. This study discusses the legal framework surrounding access to healthcare for CD for Bolivian migrants living in Sao Paulo, Brazil. While recent guidelines stipulating care for CD exist, there is a lack of legal provisions to ensure they are regularly implemented. Bolivian migrants in SP have specific needs, including language differences and a high level of mobility. Interviews were conducted with ten participants representing public health institutions or organizations working with the Bolivian migrant community. Additionally, a review was conducted of legal, official, and health policy documents pertaining to rights of Bolivian migrants in SP. Although the right to healthcare is constitutionally guaranteed for all, in practice, immigrants, especially those without documentation, encounter barriers to initiating treatment for CD. Providing the primary health care system (SUS) card would not only improve access to healthcare for Bolivian migrants, but also provide a potential pathway toward regularization of status. The approval of clinical protocols and therapeutic guidelines for CD (2018) represents an opportunity to improve care for all Brazilians with CD. Programs with multidisciplinary teams should be developed taking into account the specific social and cultural needs of this population.

AB  - Simple Summary Triatomines are blood-sucking insects, potential vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Triatoma guazu and Triatoma williami are phylogenetically very close and occur in sympatry. Morphologic, morphometric, and genetic analyses were performed to discuss the taxonomic status of these species. Morphometric and molecular data do not show diagnostic characteristics between species, whereas their different patterns of connexival spots were considered a phenotypic polymorphism, common in triatomines. These results suggest T. guazu as a junior synonym of T. williami. Therefore, the synonym between these species is formally proposed here. Triatoma guazu Lent and Wygodzinsky and Triatoma williami Galvao, Souza, and Lima (Hemiptera: Triatominae) are found in human dwellings and are potential vectors of the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Triatoma guazu was described based solely on a single female specimen, from the municipality of Villarica, Guaira Department, Paraguay, and posteriorly, a male from Barra do Garcas, Mato Grosso, Brazil was described and designated as the allotype of this species. Triatoma williami is found in the central-west of Brazil between Goias, Mato Grosso, and Mato Grosso do Sul. However, the taxonomic "status" of these species is questioned. Previous studies indicate the lack of isoenzymatic diagnostic loci, morphometric similarity, low genetic divergence, and close evolutionary relationship of these species. In this study, we compared the morphology, morphometry, and mitochondrial DNA fragments of the populations of the two species. The morphological diagnostic characteristic among these species is the difference in the connexivum spots pattern, which has been recognized as a phenotypic variation that exists among populations resulting from ecological diversity. Furthermore, our analysis also revealed the morphometric similarity and low genetic divergence between these species. Therefore, in the present paper, we formally propose T. guazu as a junior synonym of T. williami.

AB  - This research analysed the spatiotemporal distribution of triatomines infected by trypanosomatid parasites in an endemic region for Chagas disease, in the state of Pernambuco, Northeastern Brazil. The database included the total number of triatomines captured from intradomicile and peridomicile areas, as well as the infection rate (IR) by trypanosomatid. The Gi* by Getis-Ord method was used to statistically identify significant concentration clusters and the IR of triatomines by trypanosomatids. A generalized linear regression model with a binomial distribution was used to evaluate the probability of finding an IR by trypanosomatids. Overall, of 4,800 triatomines examined, trypanosomatid forms similar to Trypanosoma cruzi were detected in 10.29% of them, and the majority of positive specimens (98.17%) were collected at intradomicile. The geospatial analyses identified triatomines clusters in intradomicile and peridomicile environments. According to the logistic regression data for species (Panstrongylus lutzi, P. megistus, Triatoma brasiliensis and T. pseudomaculata), the probability of detection of T. cruzi infection remains constant in up to 50 specimens examined or more. The findings of this research revealed a scenario never studied in this area through this type of spatiotemporal analysis, which is essential to identify areas of vulnerability for the occurrence of these vectors and consequently for Chagas disease.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease (CD) is caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and can be carried by different species of triatomines, including Rhodnius neglectus, which is wild, well distributed in Brazil, and has formed colonies in palm trees located in urban areas of municipalities in the state of Sao Paulo. Chemical control has been routinely used to reduce population density, but each year, there has been an increase in species dispersion and density. This study aimed to evaluate the susceptibility of insects to insecticides used in control.
   Methods: The reference population was collected from Aracatuba municipality, Nilce Maia. Dilutions of deltamethrin were prepared and applied to the back of the first-stage nymphs, which were biologically synchronized. The control group received pure acetone only. Mortality was assessed after 72 h.
   Results: The mortality rate with respect to diagnostic dose was 100%. The susceptibility profile observed for this population showed RR50 ranging from 1.76 to 3.632.
   Conclusions: The populations were susceptible to the insecticides tested. It is possible that the insecticide residual effect on this ecotope has decreased the lifespan, and controlling failures may be the cause of recolonization in this environment.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and it is endemic in Central, South America, Mexico and the South of the United States. It is an important cause of early mortality and morbidity, and it is associated with poverty and stigma. A third of the cases evolve into chronic cardiomyopathy and gastrointestinal disease. The infection is transmitted vertically and by blood/organ donation and can reactivate with immunosuppression. Case identification requires awareness and screening programmes targeting the population at risk (women in reproductive age, donors, immunocompromised patients). Treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox is most effective in the acute phase and prevents progression to chronic phase when given to children. Treating women antenatally reduces but does not eliminate vertical transmission. Treatment is poorly tolerated, contraindicated during pregnancy, and has little effect modifying the disease in the chronic phase. Screening is easily performed with serology. Migration has brought the disease outside of the endemic countries, where the transmission continues vertically and via blood and tissue/organ donations. There are more than 32 million migrants from Latin America living in non-endemic countries. However, the infection is massively underdiagnosed in this setting due to the lack of awareness by patients, health authorities and professionals. Blood and tissue donation screening policies have significantly reduced transmission in endemic countries but are not universally established in the non-endemic setting. Antenatal screening is not commonly done. Other challenges include difficulties accessing and retaining patients in the healthcare system and lack of specific funding for the interventions. Any strategy must be accompanied by education and awareness campaigns directed to patients, professionals and policy makers. The involvement of patients and their communities is central and key for success and must be sought early and actively. This review proposes strategies to address challenges faced by non-endemic countries.

AB  - Background
   Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy caused by Trypanosoma cruzi is the result of a pathologic process starting during the acute phase of parasite infection. Among different factors, the specific recognition of glycan structures by glycan-binding proteins from the parasite or from the mammalian host cells may play a critical role in the evolution of the infection.
   Methodology and Principal Findings
   Here we investigated the contribution of galectin-1 (Gal-1), an endogenous glycan-binding protein abundantly expressed in human and mouse heart, to the pathophysiology of T. cruzi infection, particularly in the context of cardiac pathology. We found that exposure of HL-1 cardiac cells to Gal-1 reduced the percentage of infection by two different T. cruzi strains, Tulahuen (TcVI) and Brazil (TcI). In addition, Gal-1 prevented exposure of phosphatidylserine and early events in the apoptotic program by parasite infection on HL-1 cells. These effects were not mediated by direct interaction with the parasite surface, suggesting that Gal-1 may act through binding to host cells. Moreover, we also observed that T. cruzi infection altered the glycophenotype of cardiac cells, reducing binding of exogenous Gal-1 to the cell surface. Consistent with these data, Gal-1 deficient (Lgals1(-/-)) mice showed increased parasitemia, reduced signs of inflammation in heart and skeletal muscle tissues, and lower survival rates as compared to wild-type (WT) mice in response to intraperitoneal infection with T. cruzi Tulahuen strain.
   Conclusion/Significance
   Our results indicate that Gal-1 modulates T. cruzi infection of cardiac cells, highlighting the relevance of galectins and their ligands as regulators of host-parasite interactions.

AB  - American trypanosomiasis is one of the few native parasites of this continent. As a zoonosis, Trypanosoma cruzi infects about 180 species out of 25 families of mammals. Its regular transmission is through triatomines, which can easily transmit parasites either by the skin route (contamination of mammals skin with their feces) or by oral route (ingestion of food contaminated with complete triatomines or their feces) and additionally through haematogenous via (congenital and transfusional) and by tissues (transplants). The oral route, which seems to be the ancestral form of transmission to wild and domestic mammals, has recently become more important after the success achieved in the control of domicile vectors using residual pesticides. From its initial diagnosis in 1967, tens of oral outbreaks have been diagnosed mostly in the Brazilian Amazon and subsequently in other four countries in South America. Environmental imbalance caused by man through the invasion and deforestation of woodlands, results in reduction of biodiversity of mammals as food source for triatomines, affecting the "dilution effect" of T. cruzi in the nature increasing the risk of human infection. On the other hand, triatomines invade houses looking for new blood sources. One of the consequences of domiciliated triatomines is the food contamination spread, especially in home-made juices, which has been the source of infection of most oral outbreaks. Other biotic and abiotic factors help to explain the recent increase of oral transmission outbreaks of Chagas disease, distributed in nine eco-regions of America. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Triatoma sherlocki Papa, Jurberg, Carcavallo, Cerqueira & Barata was described in 2002, based on specimens caught in the wild in the municipality of Gentio do Ouro, Bahia, Brazil. In 2009, nymphs and adults were detected inside homes and sylvatic specimens were positive for Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas). No information on the bionomics of T. sherlocki exists, although such data are considered essential to estimate its vector and colonization potential in domestic environments. Herein, the biological cycle of T. sherlocki was studied based on 123 eggs, with nymphs and adults fed on Mus musculus (Linnaeus). Nymphal development time phases, number of meals consumed, and stage-specific mortality rates were analyzed. Survival time under starvation conditions was measured between ecdysis and death among 50 nymphs (first to fifth instar) and 50 male and female adults. The median development time from egg to adult was 621.0 (CI: 489-656) d. The number of meals consumed ranged from 1 to 20 for nymphs of the first to fifth instar. The fifth instar showed the greatest resistance to starvation, with amean of 156.5 d. The high number of meals consumed by T. sherlocki favored infection with and transmission of T. cruzi. The full development of this species under laboratory conditions with a lowmortality rate indicates that this vector presents biological characteristics that may contribute to its adaptation to artificial human ecotopes. Its high resistance to starvation emphasizes the importance of entomological surveillance for this species.

AB  - Author summary Chagas disease is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoon Trypanosoma cruzi, is the third most common parasitic infection worldwide, the most important in Latin America and is an emerging disease in non-endemic countries. Actually, millions of people live in areas of exposure and are at risk of contracting the infection. Most of the infected individuals remain asymptomatic for all of their lives, but around 30% of the chronically infected individuals develop irreversible cardiac damage and 10% digestive lesions. Host genetic factors have been suggested to play an important role in the susceptibility or resistance to Chagas disease. In this work, we investigated variants of the IL18 gene in different Latin America populations. This gene encoded the interleukin-18, which is involved in the immune response to intracellular pathogens like T. cruzi. Our results showed that an IL18 gene variant plays an important role in the protection against T. cruzi infection.
   Host genetic factors have been suggested to play an important role in the susceptibility to Chagas disease. Given the influence of interleukin 18 (IL-18) in the development of the disease, in the present study, we analyzed three IL18 genetic variants (rs2043055, rs1946518, rs360719) regarding the predisposition to Trypanosoma cruzi infection and the development of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC), in different Latin America populations. Genetic data of 3,608 patients from Colombia, Bolivia, Argentina, and Brazil were meta-analyzed to validate previous findings with increased statistical power. Seropositive and seronegative individuals were compared for T. cruzi infection susceptibility. In the Colombian cohort, the allelic frequencies of the three variants showed a significant association, with adjustment for sex and age, and also after applying multiple testing adjustments. Among the Colombian and Argentinean cohorts, rs360719 showed a significant genetic effect in a fixed-effects meta-analysis after a Bonferroni correction (OR: 0.76, CI: 0.66-0.89, P = 0.001). For CCC, the rs2043055 showed an association with protection from cardiomyopathy in the Colombian cohort (OR: 0.79, CI: 0.64-0.99, P = 0.037), with adjustment for sex and age, and after applying multiple testing adjustments. The meta-analysis of the CCC vs. asymptomatic patients from the four cohorts showed no evidence of association. In conclusion, our results validated the association found previously in the Colombian cohort suggesting that IL18 rs360719 plays an important role in the susceptibility to T. cruzi infection and no evidence of association was found between the IL18 genetic variants and CCC in the Latin American population studied.

AB  - Ethanolic extract from the leaves of Zanthoxylum monogynum A. St-Hil (Rutaceae) was fractionated by liquid-liquid partition and by column adsorption chromatography, resulting in the characterization of the lignans savinin, cubebin, 9R- and 9S-3,4-dimethoxyl-3,4-methylenedioxycubebin, and hinokinin, which have several biological activities already described in the literature. The structural identification of these metabolites was made by GC-MS and 1D and 2D NMR analysis. The extract was also tested for its activity against the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease, that has high incidence in individuals of the poorest regions of Brazil. The antiparasitic analysis of the extract against the epimastigote form of strains Y (domestic cycle) and Dm28c (wild and domestic cycle) presented IC50 results of 69.03 mu g.mL(-1) and 88.75 mu g.mL(-1), respectively, considered satisfactory. In order to propose a possible mechanism of action for the extract lethality, a gel zymography test was performed with peptidases extracted from the parasite. Results showed that the extract was able to inhibit migration of peptidases, which are essential for its life cycle. Thus, Z. monogynum leaves extract presents a promising potential for use in the treatment of Chagas disease.

TI  - The risk of oral transmission in an area of a Chagas disease outbreak in the Brazilian northeast evaluated through entomological, socioeconomic and schooling indicators

AB  - Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease strongly associated with low socioeconomic status, affecting nearly 8 million people - mainly Latin Americans. The current infection risk is based on acute case reports, most of which are typically associated with oral transmissions. In the semi-arid region of Northeastern Brazil, serious outbreaks of this transmission type have surged in the last years. One of those occurred in 2016 in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. Rural residents of four municipalities surrounding Marcelino Vieira ingested sugar cane juice - which was probably ground with Trypanosoma cruzi-infected insects. Eighteen cases of Chagas disease were confirmed serologically, with two deaths reported. Socioeconomic information, schooling of residents and the structure of peridomestic and domestic environments in the rural area of Marcelino Vieira, along with entomological indicators, were investigated to understand better the factors related to the outbreaks in this region. We found triatomines (mainly Triatoma brasiliensis) in 35% (24/67) of domiciliary units and all rocky outcrops inspected (n = 7). Overall, 25% (91/357) of examined T. brasiliensis were infected by T. cruzi in artificial ecotopes, with almost the same prevalence in the sylvatic environment (22%; 35/154). Among all ecotopes investigated, wood/tile/brick piles were the ones linked to high insect infestations and triatomine T. cruzi infection prevalence. Ninety-five percent of people interviewed recognized the triatomines and knew the classic mute of transmission of disease - triatomine bite-dependent. However, only 7.5% admitted knowledge that Chagas disease can also be acquired orally - which poses a risk this transmission route currently recognized. Here, we highlight the physical proximity between humans and triatomine populations with high T. cruzi infection prevalence as an additional risk factor to oral/vector contaminations. In sum, residents have low income, low level of education, and/or a willful disregard for the mutes of Chagas disease transmission (specifically oral transmission), a combination of factors that may have favored the Chagas disease outbreak. We here provide recommendations to avoid further outbreaks.

AB  - The high fat diet (HFD) can trigger metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Trypanosome cruzi infection induces progressive inflammatory manifestations capable to affect the structure and the function of important organs such as the heart and liver. Here we aimed to investigate the effects of a HFD on the immune response and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities during acute infection with the T. cruzi strain VL-10. The VL-10 strain has cardiac tropism and causes myocarditis in mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with either: (i) regular diet (Reg) or (ii) HFD for 8 weeks, after which mice in each group were infected with T. cruzi. Mice were euthanized on day 30 after infection, and the liver and heart were subjected to histology and zymography to determine MMP-2 activities and plasma levels of IL-10, TNF, CCL2, and CCL5. T. cruzi-infected HFD animals had higher parasitemia, LDL and total cholesterol levels. Regardless of diet, plasma levels of all inflammatory mediators and cardiac MMP-2 activity were elevated in infected mice in contrast with the low plasma levels of leptin. HFD animals presented micro- and macrovesicular hepatic steatosis, while cardiac leukocyte infiltration was mainly detected in T. cruzi-infected mice. Our findings suggested that a HFD promotes higher circulating T. cruzi load and cardiac and liver immunopathogenesis in an experimental model using the VL-10 strain of the T. cruzi.

AB  - The limited efficacy of benznidazole (Bz) indicated by failures of current Phase II clinical trials emphasizes the urgent need to identify new drugs with improved safety and efficacy for treatment of Chagas disease (CD). Herein, we analyzed the efficacy of a series of 2-hydroxy-3-phenylsulfanylmethyl-[1,4]-naphthoquinones against different Trypanosoma cruzi discrete type units (DTUs) of relevant clinical forms of CD. Cytotoxic and trypanocidal effect of naphthoquinone derivatives were assessed in mammalian cells, trypomastigotes and intracellular amastigotes using, luminescent assays (CellTiter-Glo and T. cruzi Dm28c-luciferase) and/or counting with a light microscope. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and intracellular targets of promising compounds were assessed with 2',7'-dichlorodihy-drofluorescein diacetate (H(2)DCFDA) probe and ultrastructural analysis, respectively. ADMET properties were analyzed by in silico modeling. Most of the compounds showed low cytotoxic effect. Only two compounds (Compounds 2 and 11) had IC50 values lower than Bz, showing higher susceptibility of bloodstream trypomastigotes. Compound 2 exhibited greater efficacy against trypomastigotes from different T. cruzi DTUs, even better than Bz against Brazil and CL strains. Ultrastructural analysis revealed changes in intracellular compartments, suggesting autophagy as one possible mechanism of action. Oxidative stress, induced by Compound 2, resulted in elevated level of ROS, leading to parasite death. Compound 2 was also effective against intracellular amastigotes, showing high selectivity index. ADMET analysis predicted good oral bioavailability, reduced drug metabolism and no carcinogenic potential for Compound 2. The data highlight Compound 2 as a hit compound and stimulate further structural and pharmacological optimization to potentiate its trypanocidal activity and selectivity.

AB  - This study aimed to describe the main entomological triatomine-related indicators in the western mesoregion of Rio Grande do Norte. This is a descriptive cross-sectional retrospective study developed on a historical analysis of information on the triatomine capture carried out by the Chagas Disease Control Program, from 2008 to 2013. Five species were captured, of which the Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma pseudomaculata, by occupying the domestic and peridomestic environment, sequentially, and Panstrongylus lutzi by the highest rate of natural infection. A prevalence of nymphs among the captured specimens, a higher triatominal density in the peridomicile, infestation, colonization and natural infection rates of 5.6%, 49.6% and 0.8%, respectively, a significant difference in the distribution of specimens between the municipalities investigated and lack of declining infestation and colonization rates between 2009 and 2012 was observed. Findings suggest the need for continuous surveillance, facilitated by the association between field teams and communities, with emphasis on the proposal of health education for the recognition and notification of triatomines by the population.

AB  - Translational research (TR) is an interdisciplinary branch of the biomedical field that seeks to connect its three supporting pillars: basic research on the bench, the hospital beds and other health system services, and the delivery of products for the well-being and health of the community. Here, we review the five transition stages of the TR spectrum, registering the lessons learned during > 20 years leading to the first clinical trial designed and performed in Brazil for testing a complementary treatment for Chagas disease (CD): the selenium trial (STCC). Lessons learned were: (1) to consider all the TR spectrum since the beginning of the project; (2) to start simultaneously animal studies and translation to humans; (3) to ensure a harmonious interaction between clinical and basic research teams; (4) to include MSc and PhD students only in pre-clinical and basic studies (TRO) or vertical clinical studies using retrospective samples and data (TRI); (5) to identify potential suppliers in the national commercial market for a future final treatment since the pre-clinical stage; (6) to keep an international network of experts as permanent advisers on the project. In the whole process, some perspectives were created: a complementary clinical trial for the opened questions and the construction of a Brazilian clinical CD platform.

AB  - Objective Chagas disease (CD) globalization facilitated the co-infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in endemic and non-endemic areas. Considering the underestimation of Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi)-HIV co-infection and the risk of life-threatening Chagas Disease Reactivation (CDR), this study aimed to analyze the major co-infection clinical characteristics and its mortality rates.
   Methods This is a cross-sectional retrospective multicenter study of patients with CD confirmed by two serological or one parasitological tests, and HIV infection confirmed by immunoblot. CDR was diagnosed by direct microscopy with detection of trypomastigote forms in the blood or other biological fluids and/or amastigote forms in inflammatory lesions.
   Results Out of 241 patients with co-infection, 86.7% were from Brazil, 47.5% had <200 CD4(+) T cells/mu L and median viral load was 17,000 copies/mu L. Sixty CDR cases were observed. Death was more frequent in patients with reactivation and was mainly caused by CDR. Other causes of death unrelated to CDR were the manifestation of opportunistic infections in those with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. The time between the co-infection diagnosis to death was shorter in patients with CDR. Lower CD4(+) cells count at co-infection diagnosis was independently associated with reactivation. Similarly, lower CD4(+) cells numbers at co-infection diagnosis and male sex were associated with higher lethality in CDR. Additionally, CD4(+) cells were lower in meningoencephalitis than in myocarditis and milder forms.
   Conclusion This study showed major features on T. cruzi-HIV co-infection and highlighted the prognostic role of CD4(+) cells for reactivation and mortality. Since lethality was high in meningoencephalitis and all untreated patients died shortly after the diagnosis, early diagnosis, immediate antiparasitic treatment, patient follow-up and epidemiological surveillance are essentials in T. cruzi/HIV co-infection and CDR managements.

AB  - BACKGROUND Chagas disease is a public health problem caused by infection with the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. There is currently no effective therapy for Chagas disease. Although there is some evidence for the beneficial effect of bone marrow-derived cells in chagasic disease, the mechanisms underlying their effects in the heart are unknown. Reports have suggested that bone marrow cells are recruited to the chagasic heart; however, studies using chimeric mouse models of chagasic cardiomyopathy are rare.
   OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate the migration of bone marrow cells to the heart after T. cruzi infection in a model of chagasic disease in chimeric mice.
   METHODS To obtain chimerical mice, wild-type (WT) C57BL6 mice were exposed to full body irradiation (7 Gy), causing bone marrow ablation. Then, bone marrow cells from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic mice were infused into the mice. Graft effectiveness was confirmed by flow cytometry. Experimental mice were divided into four groups: (i) infected chimeric (iChim) mice; (ii) infected WT (iWT) mice, both of which received 3 x 104 trypomastigotes of the Brazil strain; (iii) non-infected chimeric (Chim) mice; and (iv) non-infected WT mice.
   FINDINGS At one- month post-infection, iChim and iWT mice showed first degree atrioventricular block with decreased heart rate and treadmill exercise parameters compared to those in the non-infected groups. MAIN
   CONCLUSIONS iChim mice showed an increase in parasitaemia, myocarditis, and the presence of amastigote nests in the heart tissue compared to iWT mice. Flow cytometry analysis did not detect haematopoietic progenitor cells in the hearts of infected mice. Furthermore, GFP+ cardiomyocytes were not detected in the tissues of chimeric mice.

AB  - The Colecao de Vetores de Tripanosomatideos (Fiocruz/COLVET), Minas Gerais, Brazil, stands out as one of the most important collections of blood-sucking triatomines, the vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi that causes Chagas disease. The aim is to describe the collection and the services it provides to support scientific research, educational activities, and entomological surveillance between 2013-2019.The data associated with the specimens held in Fiocruz/COLVET is available from the Sistema de Informacao sobre a Biodiversidade Brasileira (SiBBr). These specimen metadata were analyzed and either tabulated or plotted on graph and maps. The records of services provided by the collection between 2013-2019 were also categorized and analyzed. There are 12,568 triatomine specimens deposited in the collection that belong to 77 species and 11 genera, from 15 American countries. Of the similar to 65 species of triatomines found in Brazil, 38 (57.6%) are present in the collection, including specimens from all biomes and all but three Brazilian states. The occurrence of Triatoma costalimai, Triatoma lenti, Rhodnius nasutus, and Panstrongylus lenti apparently collected beyond their known distribution ranges are reported and discussed. The collection provided 168 services, supporting educational activities (41.7%), scientific research (35.7%), and regional/national entomological surveillance of triatomines (22.6%). Between the years 2014 and 2020, the number of biological specimens deposited in the Fiocruz/COLVET repository increased from 4,778 to 12,568 triatomine specimens. In addition to its great value to biodiversity conservation, the collection is of great importance because of its support of research and educational activities, and contributions to entomological surveillance, and, therefore, to public health.

AB  - Differential serological diagnosis of Chagas disease and leishmaniasis is difficult owing to cross-reactivity resulting from the fact that the parasites that cause these pathologies share antigenic epitopes. Even with optimized serological assays that use parasite-specific recombinant antigens, inconclusive test results continue to be a problem. Therefore, new serological tests with high sensitivity and specificity are needed. In the present work, we developed and evaluated the performance of a new flow cytometric serological method, referred to as FC-TRIPLEX Chagas/Leish IgG1, for the all-in-one classification of inconclusive tests. The method uses antigens for the detection of visceral leishmaniasis, localized cutaneous leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease and is based on an inverted detuned algorithm for analysis of anti-Trypanosomatidae IgG1 reactivity. First, parasites were label with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Alexa Fluor 647 at various concentrations. Then serum samples were serially diluted, the dilutions were incubated with suspensions of mixed labeled parasites, and flow cytometric measurements were performed to determine percentages of positive fluorescent parasites. Using the new method, we obtained correct results for 76 of 80 analyzed serum samples (95% overall performance), underscoring the outstanding performance of the method. Moreover, we found that the fluorescently labeled parasite suspensions were stable during storage at room temperature, 4 degrees C, and -20 degrees C for 1 year. In addition, two different lots of parasite suspensions showed equivalent antigen recognition; that is, the two lots showed equivalent categorical segregation of anti-Trypanosomatidae IgG1 reactivity at selected serum dilutions. In conclusion, we have developed a sensitive and selective method for differential diagnosis of Chagas disease, visceral leishmaniasis, and localized cutaneous leishmaniasis.

AB  - Background
   Chagas cardiomyopathy is a serious and common complication of Chagas disease.
   Methods
   Through bibliometric and Social Network Analysis, we examined patterns of research on Chagas cardiomyopathy, identifying the main countries, authors, research clusters, and topics addressed; and measuring the contribution of different countries.
   Results
   We found 1932 documents on Chagas cardiomyopathy in the MEDLINE database. The most common document type was 'journal article', accounting for 79.6% of the total (n = 1538), followed by 'review' (n = 217, 11.2%). The number of published records increased from 156 in 1980-1984 to 311 in 2010-2014. Only 2.5% were clinical trials. Brazil and the USA dominated the research, participating in 53.1% and 25.7%, respectively, of the documents. Other Latin American countries where Chagas is endemic contributed less, with Bolivia, where Chagas disease is most prevalent, producing only 1.8% of the papers. We observed a high rate of domestic collaboration (83.1% of the documents published in 2010-2016) and a lower but significant rate of international collaboration (32.5% in the same time period). Although clinical research dominated overall, the USA, Mexico and several countries in Europe produced a considerable body of basic research on animal models. We identified four main research clusters, focused on heart failure and dysfunction (physical symptoms, imaging techniques, treatment), and on myocarditis and parasitemia in animal models.
   Conclusions
   Research on Chagas cardiomyopathy increased over the study period. There were more clinical than basic studies, though very few of the documents were clinical trials. Brazil and the USA are currently leading the research on this subject, while some highly endemic countries, such as Bolivia, have contributed very little. Different approaches could help to redress this imbalance: encouraging researchers to conduct more clinical trials, launching international collaborations to help endemic countries contribute more, and strengthening links between basic and clinical research.

AB  - Domestic dogs are considered reservoirs hosts for several vector-borne parasites. This study aimed to evaluate the role of domestic dogs as hosts for Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma evansi and Leishmania spp. in single and co-infections in the Urucum settlement, near the Brazil-Bolivian border. Additionally, we evaluated the involvement of wild mammals' in the maintenance of these parasites in the study area. Blood samples of dogs (n = 62) and six species of wild mammals (n = 36) were collected in July and August of 2015. The infections were assessed using parasitological, serological and molecular tests. Clinical examination of dogs was performed and their feeding habits were noted. Overall, 87% (54/62) of sampled dogs were positive for at least one trypanosomatid species, in single (n = 9) and co-infections (n = 45). We found that 76% of dogs were positive for T. cruzi, four of them displayed high parasitemias demonstrated by hemoculture, including one strain types TcI, two TcIII and one TcIII/TcV. Around 73% (45/62) of dogs were positive to T. evansi, three with high parasitemias as seen by positive microhematocrit centrifuge technique. Of dogs sampled, 50% (31/62) were positive for Leishmania spp. by PCR or serology. We found a positive influence of (i) T. evansi on mucous pallor, (ii) co-infection by T. cruzi and Leishmania with onychogryphosis, and (iii) all parasites to skin lesions of sampled dogs. Finally, feeding on wild mammals had a positive influence in the Leishmania spp. infection in dogs. We found that 28% (5/18) coati Nasua nasua was co-infected for all three trypanosamatids, demonstrating that it might play a key role in maintenance of these parasites. Our results showed the importance of Urucum region as a hotspot for T. cruzi, T. evansi and Leishmania spp. and demonstrated that dogs can be considered as incidental hosts.

AB  - Triatomine surveillance in rural areas, artificial ecotypes, and natural ecotopes of the cities of Caturama, Ibipitanga, Macaubas, and Seabra in the south-central region of the Brazilian state of Bahia was carried out between 2008 and 2013. Natural infection by Trypanosoma cruzi was evaluated in the specimens collected to monitor vectors of Chagas disease. A total of 1,357 specimens were collected, and four species were identified: Triatoma sordida (83%), Triatoma lend (16.4%), Triatoma pseudomaculata (0.5%), and Panstrongylus geniculatus (0.1%). Triatoma sordida was found in four cities, only 0.7% in intradomiciliary environments. Triatoma lend was found only in Macaubas; 8.5% were found in intradomiciliary environments, 88.3% in peridomiciliary environments, and 3.1% in sylvatic environments. Natural infection by T. cruzi was 0.5% for T. sordida and 3.1% T. lenti. All of these cases were found in peridomiciliary environments of Macaubas. As the results show, triatomines were found in intradomiciliary environments in three cities that were surveyed in the south-central region of the state of Bahia. Thus, an epidemiologic survey should be performed to avoid the risk of transmission to the population.

AB  - Objective:To investigate, through a systematic review, the effects of the use of highly diluted drugs in the treatment of experimental infection withTrypanosoma cruzi. Design:The authors searched for scientific publications in the databases PubMed, Web of Science, SCOPUS, LILACS, and the Google Scholar search system, from 2000 to 2018, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. According to the criteria established, a total of 22 studies were included. Settings/Location:The study took place at the State University of Maringa, Maringa, PR, Brazil. Subjects:Male mice (Mus musculus) or rats (Rattus norvegicus). Interventions:Highly diluted drugs. Outcome measures:The parameters evaluated in the studies were parasitological, clinical, immunological, histopathological and hematological. Results:The studies demonstrated that the effects of highly diluted drugs are related to their dynamizations, treatment regimen, and host susceptibility toT. cruziinfection, and depend on the initial information transmitted to the treated organism, making this information the "model" of how the treated organism will react. Regardless of the mechanism of action, these drugs provide a decrease in inflammation, which is one of the central phenomena of the pathogenesis ofT. cruziinfection. Conclusions:This systematic review brings out the importance of theT. cruziinfection model as a reliable and valid model for studying different effects produced by highly diluted drugs. Considering the findings and in a broader perspective, this study contributes to considering these drugs as a possible way of dealing with "treatment" in general, presents the need to reexamine the biochemical model and develop a model for the effect of high dilutions in general, as well as for the treatment of parasitic infections.

AB  - Background: Despite the intensification of Chagas disease control in Brazil, around 1980s and 1990s, the transmission still occurs. The aim of this study was to identify the factors associated with Chagas disease among blood donors in Piaui State, Brazilian Northeast Region from 2004 to 2013.
   Methodology: Records of 597 blood donors from Management System in Hemotherapy Services and Laboratory Environment Manager System of Piaui were studied. Sociodemographic variables and serological tests results for Chagas disease's confirmation were analyzed using adjusted multiple logistic regression and odds ratio (OR) evaluation.
   Results: The frequency of serological test confirming Chagas disease was 15.6%. Multivariate analysis showed that the most important associated factors were among blood donors who were born until 1960 (OR 5.1; 95%; CI 1.95-13.14), with low educational level (OR 2.8; 95%; CI 0.75-10.29), who lives in cities with <= 50% of urbanization rate (OR 3.5; 95%; CI 1.42-8.72) and first-time blood donors (OR 3.0; 95%; CI 1.74-5.23).
   Conclusions: Unfortunately, the factors associated with Chagas disease are still the same pointed out in the scientific literature of decades ago. Our results are in line with the postulate of the 2nd Brazilian Consensus on Chagas disease, regarding the need to develop research that presents new scientific evidence, contributing not only to the Brazilian scenario but also to Latin America.

AB  - Author summary Blood-sucking bugs are vectors of the parasiteTrypanosoma cruzi, which causes the Chagas disease.Triatoma brasiliensisis the main Chagas disease vector in the Caatinga eco-region of northeastern Brazil. Previous studies have already indicated that this species is associated with rodents of the Caviidae family-mainly in the sylvatic environment. In this study, we showed that these rodents are the main food sources ofT.brasiliensisalso in peridomestic environments. This association is frequently followed by numerous populations ofT.cruziinfected insects in man-made ecotopes to store materials of mineral and wood origin. We suggest that the key-host that drives these infestations are mainlyGalea spixii, followed byKerodon rupestris(both Rodentia: Caviidae), which seem to be in synanthropic processes because they were found as frequent blood meals forT.brasiliensisin the sylvatic and domestic environments. Other mammals-mainly cats-may play an important role in Chagas disease eco-epidemiology for also being an important source of food for triatomines in the sylvatic and peridomestic environments. We conclude that educational programs to avoid Chagas disease transmission should include advising local people to avoid storing wood and tiles/bricks in the peridomestic environment-shelters for key-host rodents. Besides, they must be aware that these cavies may be infected byT.cruzi; and cautions are needed if they are to be used as a source of protein by hunting.
   Innovative approaches used to combat Chagas disease transmission tend to combine a set of comprehensive efforts to understand the ecology of local vectors. In this work we identified molecularly the blood meal of 181Triatoma brasiliensis, distributed in 18 populations (8 sylvatic and 10 peridomestic), which were collected across a range of 240 km (East-West) and 95 km (North-South) in the semi-arid region of northeastern, Brazil. We used the vertebrate mitochondrial gene (cytochrome B) sequencing applied to DNA isolated from bug midgut to identify the insect blood meal sources via the BLAST procedure. The peridomestic populations were classified according to two main hypotheses of site-occupancy forT.brasiliensis: the first says that the infestation is mainly driven by structures that resemble its natural habitat (stony-like ecotopes) and the second assumes that it is associated with key-hosts (rodents and goats). Rodents of the Caviidae family (Galea spixiiandKerodon rupestris) were identified as the key-host ofT.brasiliensis, but also the potentialTrypanosoma cruzireservoir-able to connect the sylvatic and domesticT.cruzicycle. Cats also deserve to be studied better, as potentialT.cruzireservoirs. By modeling the food sources + site-occupancy +T.cruzinatural infection, we identified man-made ecotopes suitable for forming dense triatomine infestations with high rates ofT.cruzinatural infection, which may be taken into account for vector control measures.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease is related to ischemic stroke (IS), although few epidemiological studies have evaluated the associated mortality and recurrence. Our objective is to determine factors associated with mortality and recurrence of IS in patients with IS and Chagas disease. Methods: We retrospectively studied data obtained from electronic medical records of patients admitted at SARAH Hospitals across Brazil between 2009 and 2013. Using Cox regression analysis for mortality and logistic regression for recurrence, we assessed primary population characteristics and statistical associations between risk factors and outcomes. Results: We analyzed 279 patients who were followed up until 2016. The mean age at stroke onset was 61 with a 10% frequency of death. Multivariate analysis assessing mortality demonstrated that the associated factors were age at stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.04), initial modified Rankin Scale (mRS; HR 20.91), bladder dysfunction (HR 2.51), diabetes mellitus (DM; HR 3.64), and alcoholism (HR 3.37). Multivariate analysis assessing recurrence demonstrated that the associated factors were age at ictus (OR 0.96), cognitive deficit (OR 0.44), initial mRS (OR 1.84), cardioembolic etiology (OR 2.47), and female sex (OR 2.73). Conclusions: Cardiac conditions did not correlate with mortality or recurrence. Age was a protective factor against recurrence, probably due to cumulative risk of IS over time, while initial mRS was associated with both outcomes. Treating diseases such as DM and bladder dysfunction, and early treatment to reduce the initial mRS could potentially prevent both outcomes; also, establishing a correct etiological diagnosis is important.

AB  - We studied infection by Trypanosomatidae in bats captured in two areas with different degradation levels in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state: Reserva Ecologica de Guapiacu (REGUA) and EstacAo Fiocruz Mata Atlantica (EFMA). Furthermore, we evaluated whether the diversity of trypanosomatids changes according to bat diversity and the different levels of preservation in the region. The results showed no influence of the level of preservation on bat species richness (15 and 14 species, respectively), with similar chiropterofauna and higher abundance of two common fruit-eating bat species in the tropics: Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus lituratus. Of the 181 bat specimens analyzed by LIT/Schneider hemoculture, we detected 24 infected individuals (13%), including one positive Sturnira lilium individual that was also positive by fresh blood examination. Molecular characterization using nested PCR targeting the 18 SSU rRNA-encoding gene fragment showed similar trypanosomatid infection rates in bats from the two areas: 15% in REGUA and 11% in EFMA (p = 0.46). Trypanosoma dionisii was the most frequently detected parasite (54%), followed by T. cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV and Trypanosoma sp., in Neotropical phyllostomid bats (RNMO63 and RNMO56); mixed infections by T. dionisii/T. cruzi TcIII and T. dionisii/T. cruzi TcI were also observed. The T. cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV are the genotypes currently involved in cases of acute Chagas disease in Brazil, and T. dionisii was recently found in the heart tissue of an infected child. Surprisingly, we also describe for the first time Crithidia mellificae, a putative monoxenous parasite from insects, infecting a vertebrate host in the Americas. Bats from the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state harbor a great diversity of trypanosomatids, maintaining trypanosomatid diversity in this sylvatic environment.
   Author summary Among all mammals carrying trypanosomatids, bats are considered some of the most ancient hosts, and due to their good adaptation to different landscape features, they may play an important role in parasite dispersion. To assess whether the diversity of trypanosomatid species in bats is affected by the level of environmental disturbance, we collected blood from bats in two localities of Rio Janeiro state in Brazil: one with high and another with low human interference (more preserved). The collected blood was subjected to fresh blood tests and hemoculture. Using the 18S RNA gene as a molecular target, we identified 24 bats (13%) infected by trypanosomatids, mostly by T. dionisii, a trypanosome species commonly found in all Brazilian biomes and highly associated with bats. Three subpopulations (DTUs I, III and IV) of T. cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, were also found to infect bats. In addition, we detected for the first time a putative insect-associated parasite, Crithidia mellificae, in a mammal host in the Americas. Our work reveals the high diversity of trypanosomatids infecting bats of the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state, reinforcing their importance as potential reservoirs of trypanosomatids.

AB  - Chagas disease persists as one of the most important, and yet most neglected, diseases in the world, and several changes in its epidemiological aspects have been recorded since its discovery. Currently, some of the most relevant changes are related to: (i) the reduction in the incidence of the endemic due to the control of the most important vectors, Triatoma infestans and Rhodnius prolixus, in many countries; (ii) the migration of human populations spreading cases of the disease throughout the world, from endemic to non-endemic areas, transforming Chagas disease into a global threat; and (iii) new acute cases and deaths caused by oral transmission, especially in the north of Brazil. Despite the reduction in the number of cases, new challenges need to be responded to, including monitoring and control activities aiming to prevent house infestation by the secondary vectors from occurring. In 1979, Lent & Wygodzinsky(1) published the most complete review of the subfamily Triatominae, encompassing 111 recognised species in the taxon. Forty-two years later, 46 new species and one subspecies have been described or revalidated. Here we summarise the new species and contextualise them regarding their ecology, epidemiologic importance, and the obstacles they pose to the control of Chagas disease around the world.

AB  - Seropositivity and risk factors for visceral leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, toxoplasmosis, and leptospirosis were investigated in 200 dogs and twenty-three owners in a municipality with a history of human cases of visceral leishmaniasis and toxoplasmosis in the region of Sertao, Paraiba State, Northeastern Brazil. In dogs, frequencies of 6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.7-9.3%), 7.5% (95% CI = 3.8-11.2%), 18% (95% CI = 12.7-23.3%), and 14% (95% CI = 9.2-18.8%) were found for visceral leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, toxoplasmosis, and leptospirosis, respectively. An age of over 72 months and environment conditions (soil) were identified as risk factors for Leishmania chagasi infection. Free housing was identified as risk factor for Trypanosoma cruzi infection. For toxoplasmosis, free housing and contact with cats were found to be risk factors, while commercial food was a risk factor for leptospirosis. Of the twenty-three owners who agreed to participate in the study, eight were tested for leishmaniasis, three for Chagas disease, nine for toxoplasmosis, eleven for leptospirosis, and five were tested for more than one disease. Only anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies were found in the human population at a frequency of 44.4% (4/9); for all other diseases, all individuals were negative. The results indicate that such zoonoses are present in dogs from the studied region, but only toxoplasmosis was found in the owners. Our risk analysis suggests that cleaner soil, better storage of dog food, and avoiding free housing can reduce the risk of infection by these diseases.

AB  - Background
   Insecticide spraying efficiently controls house infestation by triatomine bugs, the vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi. The strategy, however, is ineffective against sylvatic triatomines, which can transmit Chagas disease by invading (without colonizing) man-made structures. Despite growing awareness of the relevance of these transmission dynamics, the drivers of house invasion by sylvatic triatomines remain poorly understood.
   Methods/Findings
   About 12,000 sylvatic triatomines were caught during routine surveillance in houses of Tocantins state, Brazil, in 2005-2013. Using negative binomial regression, information-theoretic model evaluation/averaging, and external model validation, we investigated the effects of regional (Amazon/Cerrado), landscape (preservation/disturbance), and climate covariates (temperature, rainfall) on the municipality-aggregated numbers of house-invading Rhodnius pictipes, R. robustus, R. neglectus, and Panstrongylus geniculatus. House invasion by R. pictipes and R. robustus was overall more frequent in the Amazon biome, tended to increase in municipalities with more well-preserved land, and decreased in rainier municipalities. Across species, invasion decreased with higher landscape-disturbance levels and in hotter-day municipalities. Invasion by R. neglectus and P. geniculatus increased somewhat with more land at intermediate disturbance and peaked in average-rainfall municipalities. Temperature effects were more pronounced on P. geniculatus than on Rhodnius spp.
   Conclusions
   We report widespread, frequent house invasion by sylvatic triatomines in the Amazon-Cerrado transition. Our analyses indicate that readily available environmental metrics may help predict the risk of contact between sylvatic triatomines and humans at coarse geographic scales, and hint at specific hypotheses about climate and deforestation effects on those vectors-with some taxon-specific responses and some seemingly general trends. Thus, our focal species appear to be quite sensitive to higher temperatures, and might be less common in more heavily-disturbed than in better-preserved environments. This study illustrates, in sum, how entomological routine-surveillance data can be efficiently used for Chagas disease risk prediction and stratification when house-colonizing vectors are absent.

AB  - Background: Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is currently divided into six discrete typing units (DTUs), named TcI-TcVI. TcII is among the major DTUs enrolled in human infections in South America southern cone, where it is associated with severe cardiac and digestive symptoms. Despite the importance of TcII in Chagas disease epidemiology and pathology, so far, no genome-wide comparisons of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of TcII field isolates have been performed to track the variability and evolution of this DTU in endemic regions.
   Results: In the present work, we have sequenced and compared the whole nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of seven TcII strains isolated from chagasic patients from the central and northeastern regions of Minas Gerais, Brazil, revealing an extensive genetic variability within this DTU. A comparison of the phylogeny based on the nuclear or mitochondrial genomes revealed that the majority of branches were shared by both sequences. The subtle divergences in the branches are probably consequence of mitochondrial introgression events between TcII strains. Two T. cruzi strains isolated from patients living in the central region of Minas Gerais, S15 and S162a, were clustered in the nuclear and mitochondrial phylogeny analysis. These two strains were isolated from the other five by the Espinhaco Mountains, a geographic barrier that could have restricted the traffic of insect vectors during T. cruzi evolution in the Minas Gerais state. Finally, the presence of aneuploidies was evaluated, revealing that all seven TcII strains have a different pattern of chromosomal duplication/loss.
   Conclusions: Analysis of genomic variability and aneuploidies suggests that there is significant genomic variability within Minas Gerais TcII strains, which could be exploited by the parasite to allow rapid selection of favorable phenotypes. Also, the aneuploidy patterns vary among T. cruzi strains and does not correlate with the nuclear phylogeny, suggesting that chromosomal duplication/loss are recent and frequent events in the parasite evolution.

AB  - In 2005, a pharmaceutical care service was created in the State of Ceara to provide pharmacotherapeutic follow-up for individuals infected with Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas Disease). After 10 years of operation, an evaluation was conducted to assess the degree of satisfaction of patients treated under the service. This prospective study used a questionnaire comprising the following sections: socioeconomic data; infrastructure, facilities and operations; pharmaceutical care; and importance of the service. Seventy patients of both sexes and over 18 years of age were interviewed between August 2014 and May 2015. As for infrastructure, location and operation, the average grades show a high level of patient satisfaction. Regarding pharmaceutical care, most patients reported being satisfied and considered "being well treated" to be the most important aspect during treatment. In addition, all patients (100%) rated the service as very important and would recommend it to other individuals. Overall, the study showed a high level of patient satisfaction with the service. There is, however, still much to work to be done on this service in order to promote greater access and qualified care to fully achieve a humanized model focused on patient needs.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease is a complex anthropozoonosis with distinct domestic and sylvatic mammal species acting as potential reservoirs. The diversity of vector species and their habitats are among the factors that hinder the control of the disease. Control programs periodically monitor the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in insect bugs through microscopical observation of diluted feces. However, microscopy presents limited sensitivity in samples with low parasite numbers, difficulties in examining all evolutionary stages of the insect and may in turn be limited to differentiate T. cruzi from other morphologically similar trypanosomatids. Here, we report two highly sensitive and accurate methodologies to infer T. cruzi infection rates and to quantify parasite load in the gut of field-collected triatomines.
   Methods: Triatomines were manually collected in the period 2011-2012 and 2014-2015, in domestic, peridomestic or sylvatic habitats in rural areas of 26 municipalities, encompassing three distinct Brazilian biomes: Caatinga, Cerrado and Atlantic Rainforest. Following morphological and taxonomical identification, the search for flagellated protozoa was performed by optical microscopy. A conventional PCR targeting T. cruzi kDNA and a TaqMan qPCR directed to the parasite nuclear satellite DNA (SAT) were developed, both in multiplex, with the triatomine 12S subunit ribosomal RNA gene, used as internal amplification control. Both methods were used for detection (kDNA-PCR) and parasite load quantification (SAT-DNA-qPCR), to investigate T. cruzi infection in captured triatomines.
   Results: The combined methods were assayed on a panel of 205 field-collected triatomine samples. Diagnostic analysis revealed 21% positivity for the kDNA-PCR, whereas microscopic examination enabled identification of T. cruzi in only 7.0% of the PCR-positive samples. Negative PCR results were confirmed by the absence of T. cruzi flagellates using microscopy. Caatinga biome yielded the highest T. cruzi infection rate (60%), followed by the Atlantic Rainforest and Cerrado with 7.1 and 6.1%, respectively. In addition, a wide range distribution of parasite load, varying from 8.05 x 10(-2) to 6.31 x 10(10) was observed with a median of 2.29 x 10(3) T. cruzi/intestine units. When parasite load was analyzed by triatomine species, a significantly higher median was found for Panstrongylus lutzi in comparison with Triatoma brasiliensis.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate highly sensitive PCR-based methodologies to monitor T. cruzi infection in triatomines. In addition, the qPCR assay offers the possibility of further evaluation parasite load, as a promising biomarker of the vectorial capacity of triatomines in Chagas disease endemic areas.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease), which affects 6-7 million people worldwide, mainly in Latin America. It presents great genetic and biological variability that plays an important role in the clinical and epidemiological features of the disease. Our working hypothesis is that the genetic diversity of T. cruzi has an important impact on detection of the parasite using diagnostic techniques. The present study evaluated the diagnostic performance of parasitological, molecular, and serological techniques for detecting 27 strains of T. cruzi that belonged to discrete typing units (DTUs) TcI (11 strains), TcII (four strains), and TcIV (12 strains) that were obtained from different hosts in the states of Amazonas and Parana, Brazil. Blood samples were taken from experimentally infected mice and analyzed by fresh blood examination, hemoculture in Liver Infusion Tryptose (LIT) medium, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Polymerase chain reaction presented the best detection of TcI, with 80.4% positivity. For all of the detection methods, the animals that were inoculated with TcII presented the highest positivity rates (94.1-100%). ELISA that was performed 7 months after inoculation presented a higher detection ability (95.4%) for TcIV. Intra-DTU comparisons showed that the reproducibility of the majority of the results that were obtained with the different methods was weak for TcI and good for TcII and TcIV.

AB  - Triatoma petrocchiae is the newly member of the Triatoma brasiliensis species complex. This species overlaps with T. brasiliensis in geographic and ecotypic occupation in the sylvatic habitat because both inhabit rocky outcrops in the semi-arid portion of Brazilian northeast. In this region T. brasiliensis is the most important Chagas disease vector because it constantly colonizes domiciles. In contrast, T. petrocchiae is rarely found in peri or intradomiciliary habitats - reason why little is known about this species. Therefore, Here, we present information for the first time on. the T. petrocchiae ecotopes, genetic diversity, Trypanosoma cruzi prevalence/genotyping in comparison to T. brasiliensis. We found T. brasilensis (N=223) and T. petrocchiae (N=69) in co-habitation in rocky outcrops in three Districts of Paraiba and Rio Grande do Norte states. Forty-tree T. petrocchiae insects of eleven sampling spots (composing three geographic populations) were genotyped for the mitochondrial Cyt B gene and little geographic structure was observed. Tajima's D test suggested that species is evolving toward a mutation-drift equilibrium in our collection range. Sylvatic T. petrocchiae had 4% (3/68) of infected insects by T. cruzi, whereas T. brasiliensis had 26% (59/223). Fluorescent Fragment Length Barcoding demonstrated that all three T. petrocchiae harbored TcI whereas T. brasiliensis had TcI, but also TcIII, TcII/TcVI and T. rangeli genotype A, sometimes under mixed infections. None of infected T. petrocchiae were carrying mixed infections. However, this result should be confirmed using a larger pool of infected bugs. We here presented the first documentation of T. rangeli infecting T. brasiliensis. The finding of infected T. petrocchiae calls for constant vector monitoring because the epidemiologic scenario is dynamic and sylvatic vectors are progressively found in adaptation to anthropic environments.

AB  - Background: Panstrongylus lutzi (Neiva & Pinto, 1923) is a triatomine species native to Caatinga habitats in northeastern Brazil. It is considered an important vector of Chagas disease in this region, presenting high rates of natural infection with Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas, 1909, and readily invading houses by flight. This study describes a previously unknown chromosomal sex system in the genus Panstrongylus based on P. lutzi.
   Methods: Fifth-instar and male adults of P. lutzi originating from municipality of Varzea Alegre, Ceara (Brazil) were analysed. Chromosomal analyses of male meiotic process were done by Giemsa staining.
   Results: Chromosomal analyses of male meiosis reveal a diploid chromosome number of 24 chromosomes (20 autosomes plus X1X2X3Y). During meiotic prophase I, the sex chromosomes remained close together, forming four heteropycnotic chromocenters in zygotene, and a single chromocenter in pachytene and diplotene. Still at the diplotene stage, each one of the ten autosomal bivalents showed an evident chiasma. In metaphase I, the four sex chromosomes appeared clearly separated. The three X chromosomes were the smallest of the complement and isopycnotic with respect to the Y chromosome. Two bivalents appear larger, whereas the other eight showed no significant difference in size.
   Conclusion: Karyotype analysis of P. lutzi revealed a new sex system in the genus Panstrongylus. This result is of utmost importance to karyosystematics of P. lutzi, and demonstrates the need for further studies of this type in the subfamily Triatominae.

AB  - Background
   Bats are a highly successful, globally dispersed order of mammals that occupy a wide array of ecological niches. They are also intensely parasitized and implicated in multiple viral, bacterial and parasitic zoonoses. Trypanosomes are thought to be especially abundant and diverse in bats. In this study, we used 18S ribosomal RNA metabarcoding to probe bat trypanosome diversity in unprecedented detail.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   Total DNA was extracted from the blood of 90 bat individuals (17 species) captured along Atlantic Forest fragments of Espirito Santo state, southeast Brazil. 18S ribosomal RNA was amplified by standard and/or nested PCR, then deep sequenced to recover and identify Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) for phylogenetic analysis. Blood samples from 34 bat individuals (13 species) tested positive for infection by 18S rRNA amplification. Amplicon sequences clustered to 14 OTUs, of which five were identified as Trypanosoma cruzi I, T. cruzi III/V, Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei, Trypanosoma rangeli, and Trypanosoma dionisii, and seven were identified as novel genotypes monophyletic to basal T. cruzi clade types of the New World. Another OTU was identified as a trypanosome like those found in reptiles. Surprisingly, the remaining OTU was identified as Bodo saltans-closest non-parasitic relative of the trypanosomatid order. While three blood samples featured just one OTU (T. dionisii), all others resolved as mixed infections of up to eight OTUs.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This study demonstrates the utility of next-generation barcoding methods to screen parasite diversity in mammalian reservoir hosts. We exposed high rates of local bat parasitism by multiple trypanosome species, some known to cause fatal human disease, others non-pathogenic, novel or yet little understood. Our results highlight bats as a long-standing nexus among host-parasite interactions of multiple niches, sustained in part by opportunistic and incidental infections of consequence to evolutionary theory as much as to public health.

AB  - The triatomine insect Panstrongylus megistus, one of the most important Chagas disease vectors in Brazil, presents salivary molecules pharmacologically active to counteract homeostatic responses from the host, including inhibitors of the human complement system, a major effector of immune responses. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of P. megistus salivary gland extract (SGE) on the complement system from different host species and characterize the inhibitory effect of SGE and intestinal contents on human complement. Glands and midguts from fourth instar nymphs were used. Hemolytic assays were performed with sheep erythrocytes as complement activators by using human, rats and chickens sera in the presence or absence of SGE. An ELISA assay was carried out detect deposition of the C3b component on IgG- or agarose-sensitized microplates, in the presence or absence of SGE or midgut contents. P. megistus SGE was able to significantly inhibit the complement of the three studied species (human, rat and chiken). Both, SGE and midgut contents inhibited C3b deposition in either the classical or the alternative pathways. As conclusions, SGE and midgut from P. megistus possess anti-complement activity. The inhibitors are effective against different host species and act on the initial steps of the complement system cascade. These inhibitors may have a role in blood feeding and Trypanosoma cruzi transmission by the vector.

AB  - Introduction: Triatoma brasiliensis is the species of greatest epidemiological relevance in the semi-arid region of Brazil. This species is predominantly found in domestic environments, and it has the ability to build large colonies with high levels of natural infection via Trypanosoma cruzi. Thus, T. brasiliensis is one of the most efficient transmitters of Chagas disease (CD) to humans. Despite household spraying with residual insecticides, many areas report persistent reinfestations for reasons that remain poorly understood. Therefore, this study sought to characterize the toxicological profile of deltamethrin in T. brasiliensis from areas with persistent reinfestation in State of Ceara, Brazil. Methods: The susceptibility reference lineage (SRL) was derived from Umari. Serial dilutions of deltamethrin were prepared and applied to the dorsal abdomen of first instar nymphs. The control group received only pure acetone. Mortality was evaluated after 72h. Qualitative tests assessed mortality in response to a diagnostic dose of 1xLD(99) (0.851 nanograms of active ingredient per treated nymph) of the SRL. Results: The susceptibility profile characterization of the T. brasiliensis populations revealed 50% resistance ratios (RR50) that ranged from 0.32 to 1.21. The percentage of mortality in response to the diagnostic dose was 100%. Conclusions: We demonstrated that T. brasiliensis was highly susceptible to deltamethrin. The control difficulties found might be related to the recolonization of the triatomines originating from neighboring environments and the possible operational failures related to the process of spraying that enabled specimens less susceptible to deltamethrin to survive.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi and Toxoplasma gondii are two parasites than can be transmitted from mother to child through the placenta. However, congenital transmission rates are low for T. cruzi and high for T. gondii. Infection success or failure depends on complex parasite-host interactions in which parasites can alter host gene expression by modulating non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs. As of yet, there are no reports on altered miRNA expression in placental tissue in response to either parasite. Therefore, we infected human placental explants ex vivo by cultivation with either T. cruzi or T. gondii for 2 h. We then analyzed the miRNA expression profiles of both types of infected tissue by miRNA sequencing and quantitative PCR, sequence-based miRNA target prediction, pathway functional enrichment, and upstream regulator analysis of differentially expressed genes targeted by differentially expressed miRNAs. Both parasites induced specific miRNA profiles. GO analysis revealed that the in silico predicted targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs regulated different cellular processes involved in development and immunity, and most of the identified KEGG pathways were related to chronic diseases and infection. Considering that the differentially expressed miRNAs identified here modulated crucial host cellular targets that participate in determining the success of infection, these miRNAs might explain the differing congenital transmission rates between the two parasites. Molecules of the different pathways that are regulated by miRNAs and modulated during infection, as well as the miRNAs themselves, may be potential targets for the therapeutic control of either congenital Chagas disease or toxoplasmosis.

AB  - Triatoma sordida Stal (Hemiptera: Reduviidae), a secondary vector of Trypanosoma cruzi Chagas (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae), occasionally colonizes human sleeping quarters in Paraguay, Bolivia, and Brazil, whereas only sylvatic and peridomestic populations are found in Argentina. We carried out a cross-sectional survey of house infestation in a well-defined rural area of northeastern Argentina to identify the key habitats of T. sordida; describe its spatial distribution in an apparently undisturbed setting under no recent insecticide treatment and use metapopulation theory to investigate these spatially structured populations. Timed-manual searches in 2,177 georeferenced sites from 368 houses yielded T. sordida in 78 sites (house infestation prevalence, 19.9%). Most triatomines occurred in chicken nests, chicken coops, and trees where chickens roosted (prime habitats). Goat or sheep corrals and pig corrals had a lower fraction of occupied sites (occupancies) and abundance. Both occupancy and catch increased with increasing refuge availability according to multimodel inference with model averaging. The majority of suitable habitats were unoccupied despite their proximity to occupied sites. The site-specific occurrence of T. sordida and Triatoma infestans Klug (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) was positively and homogeneously associated over ecotopes, showing no evidence of interspecific interference. An incidence function metapopulation model (including intersite distances and vector carrying capacity) predicted a fivefold greater occupancy relative to the observed pattern, suggesting the latter represented a transient state. T. sordida failed to colonize human sleeping quarters, thrived in peridomestic habitats occupied by chickens, and had a limited occupancy likely related to a poor colonizing ability and the relative instability of its prime habitats.

AB  - Chagas cardiomyopathy is the most harmful complication of Chagas disease. The electrocardiogram is a well studied exam and has been considered an important tool for detection and evaluation of Chagas cardiomyopathy since the first years of its description. Many of its abnormalities have been described as associated with a worse prognosis. Serum BNP levels were described as inversely related to the left ventricular ejection fraction and as an independent predictor of death. It was not reported how electrocardiographic alterations correlate to NT-proBNP and its analog. The present study aims to describe the baseline electrocardiograms of a large cohort of patients with Chagas disease from endemic area and to establish an association between the number of electrocardiogram alterations and high levels of NT-ProBNP in Chagas disease patients. This study selected 1959 Chagas disease patients in 21 municipalities within a limited region in the northern part of the State of Minas Gerais (Brazil), 1084 of them had Chagas cardiomyopathy. NT-proBNP levels were suggestive of heart failure in 11.7% of this population. One or more electrocardiographic alterations have an Odds Ratio of 9.12 (CI 95% 5.62-14.80) to have NT-proBNP elevation. Considering the association between the number of 1, 2, and 3 or more alterations in electrocardiogram and NT-proBNP elevation, the ORs were 7.11 (CI 95% 4.33-11.67); 16.04 (CI 95% 9.27-27.77) and 47.82 (CI 95% 17.98-127.20), respectively. The presence and the number of typical electrocardiographic alterations of Chagas disease are independently associated with the severity of the cardiomyopathy. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The protein profiles of the epimastigote stages from eight reference strains of Trypanosoma cruzi belonging to three different lineages (TcI, TcII and TcVI) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), under standardized conditions. More than 40 protein bands were observed in each strain. Around 55% of them were not shared by all stocks (non-conserved proteins), representing their intra-specific variability. Then, they were coded for processing by numerical taxonomy, using three association coefficients and the UPGMA clustering algorithm. With all coefficients assayed, two major groups were clearly seen, confirming the dichotomy within T. cruzi taxon, as demonstrated by other molecular and biochemical approaches. In the present study, the term peptideme was used to name the groups of strains based on their polypeptide profiles, following the above-cited methodology. Then, two major peptidemes were identified, each one presenting subdivisions. The isolates identified as TcI clustered in the same major peptideme, displaying a subgroup with the opossum isolates (G, SC28, Dm28c) apart from the stock of human origin (Colombian strain). The other major peptideme also showed two subgroups, regardless the coefficient used. One of them included the TcII strains (Y, SF21), both from Brazilian patients, and the other the TcVI stocks, both originally from triatomines from Southern Brazil (CL Brener, FL). As far we know, this is the first report on the parity between the T. cruzi lineages consensually accepted and their grouping into peptidemes based on SDS-PAGE and the numerical analysis of non-conserved proteins.

AB  - Triatominae are insects notorious as vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, which is the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, and other trypanosomatids. Triatomines of the genus Rhodnius are primarily sylvatic, nevertheless the occurrence of native species that invade households suggests their possible role in the transmission of Chagas disease. Rhodnius montenegrensis was first described in 2012, but the biological aspects of this species are still unknown. This study aimed to analyze the biological aspects of R. montenegrensis under laboratory conditions. The emergence rate was 63.0%, the mean time required for the emergence was 13.9 +/- 1.7 days, the biological cycle from egg to adult phase occurred in 105.2 +/- 9.2 days, the number of bloodmeals required for each nymphal stage to reach the next stage varies between a minimum of two and a maximum of seven. The weight gained after a bloodmeal varied between 10.6 times on 1st-instar nymphs and 3.9 times on 5th-instar nymphs. The adult specimens had the lowest gain of weight, reaching 2.2 times on females and 1.6 times on males. The sex ratio observed was 1:1. These data are relevant to understand the life cycle of this new described species and to elaborate more effective vector control strategies.

AB  - Many previous studies have shown a great phylogenetic and biological variability ofTrypanosoma cruziusing different molecular and biochemical methods. Populations ofT. cruziwere initially clustered into two main lineages called TcI and TcII by the size of the mini-exon PCR product. In the present study, 33 isolates derived from three triatomine taxa, which belong to theTriatoma brasiliensisspecies complex (Triatoma juazeirensis,Triatoma melanicaandTriatoma sherlocki); collected in three distinct areas of Bahia state were characterized by PCR. The isolates were identified by the size of the mini-exon gene, 18S rRNA and 24S alpha rRNA amplicons.T. cruziisolates obtained in sylvatic and intradomiciliar ecotopes, derived fromT. juazeirensisandT. melanica,were identified as TcI while the parasites originated fromT. sherlockiwere characterized as TcI and TcII genotypes, respectively. Those species are present in sylvatic ecotopes but are able to infest intradomiciliar areas. Therefore, it would be important to maintain studies in those localities of Bahia and further investigate the possibilities of Chagas disease transmission. Human disease may occur by anyT. cruzigenotype and not only by TcII as it is the case in Amazonia.

AB  - Chronic cardiomyopathy is the main clinical manifestation of Chagas disease (CD), a disease caused by Trypanosorna cruzi infection. A hallmark of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) is a fibrogenic inflammation mainly composed of CD8 and CD4(+) T cells and macrophages. CC-chemokine ligands and receptors have been proposed to drive cell migration toward the heart tissue of CD patients. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CC-chemokine ligand and receptor genes may determine protein expression. Herein, we evaluated the association of SNPs in the CC-chemokines CCL2 (rs1024611) and CCL5 (rs2107538, rs2280788) and the CCL5/RANTES receptors CCR1 (rs3181077, rs1491961, rs3136672) and CCR5 (rs1799987) with risk and progression toward CCC. We performed a cross-sectional association study of 406 seropositive patients from endemic areas for CD in the State of Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil. The patients were classified as non-cardiopathic (A, n = 110) or cardiopathic (mild, B1, n = 163; severe, C, n = 133). Serum levels of CCL5 and CCL2/MCP-1 were elevated in CD patients but were neither associated with risk/severity of CCC nor with SNP genotypes. After logistic regression analysis with adjustment for the covariates gender and ethnicity, CCL5-403 (rs2107538) CT heterozygotes (OR = 0.5, P-value = 0.04) and T carriers (OR = 0.5, P-value = 0.01) were associated with protection against CCC. To gain insight into the participation of the CCL5-CCR5/CCR1 axis in CCC, mice were infected with the Colombian T cruzi strain. Increased CCL5 concentrations were detected in cardiac tissue. In spleen, frequencies of CCR1(+) CD8(+) T cells and CD14(+) macrophages were decreased, while frequencies of CCwR5(+) cells were increased. Importantly, CCR1(+)CD14(+) macrophages were mainly IL-10(+), while CCR5(+) cells were mostly INF+. CCR5-deficient infected mice presented reduced TNF concentrations and injury in heart tissue. Selective blockade of CCR1 (Met-RANTES therapy) in infected Ccr5(-/-) mice supported a protective role for CCR1 in CCC. Furthermore, parasite antigen stimulation of CD patient blood cells increased the frequency of CCR1(+)CD8(+) T cells and CCL5 production. Collectively, our data support that a genetic variant of CCL5 and CCR1(+) cells confer protection against Chagas heart disease, identifying the CCL5-CCR1 axis as a target for immunostimulation.

AB  - The bloodsucking bug Triatoma williami is the main vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease in State of Mato Grosso, Brazil. It occurs in sylvatic areas of Brazilian savanna with often records of adult specimens in domestic and peridomestic habitats. We describe, for the first time, the reproductive parameters of T. williami females such as fecundity, fertility and lifespan. We also evaluate whether mating and nourishment status of females of T. williami may modulate the reproductive parameters. As a result, the presence of male corroborated to increase female lifespan from 5.14 +/- 1,77 to 34.57 +/- 10,86 weeks. The oviposition rate in mated female increased 275% when we compared to the fecundity values in unmated females. Finally, our results indicate that mating is crucial to improve lifespan and fecundity of T. williami females. This characteristic may be related to the environmental conditions under T. williami develops, because the sylvatic ecotopes form small scattered colonies with infrequent access to blood sources.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of American trypanosomiasis has broad biological and genetic diversity. Remaining to be studied are polymorphisms of the blood forms and metacyclogenesis of different T. cruzi discrete typing units (DTU5). Our goal was to evaluate the relationship between T. cruzi DTUs, the morphology of blood trypomastigotes, and in vitro metacyclogenesis. T. cruzi strains that pertained to DTU5 TcI, TcII, and TcIV from different Brazilian states were used. Parameters that were related to the morphology of eight strains were assessed in thin blood smears that were obtained from mice that were inoculated with blood or culture forms, depending on strain. The metacyclogenesis of 12 strains was measured using smears with Liver Infusion Tryptose culture medium and M16 culture medium (which is poor in nutrients and has a low pH) at the exponential phase of growth, both stained with Giemsa. The morphological pattern of TcII strains was consistent with broad forms of the parasite. In TcIV strains, slender forms predominated. The Y strain (TcII) was morphologically more similar to TcIV. Significant differences in polymorphisms were observed between DTUs. Metacyclogenesis parameters, although displaying large standard deviations, differed between the DTUs, with the following descending rank order: TcII > TcI > TcIV. The mean numbers of metacyclic trypomastigotes for TcII were significantly higher than the other DTUs. Although the DTUs presented overlapping characteristics, the general pattern was that different DTU5 exhibited significantly different morphologies and metacyclogenesis, suggesting that the genetic diversity of T. cruzi could be related to parameters that are associated with the evolution of infection in mammalian hosts and its ability to disperse in nature.

AB  - This paper reports on the first occurrence of Psammolestes tertius in the Chapada Diamantina region, located in the city of Seabra, Bahia State, in northeastern Brazil. Following an active search, 24 P. tertius specimens were collected from Phacellodomus rufifrons (rufous-fronted thornbird) nests. The insects did not present any symptoms of infection by Trypanosoma cruzi. P. tertius males were cytogenetically analyzed, and the results were compared with those of other specimens from the Brazilian State of Ceara. Triatomines from both locations presented the same cytogenetic characteristics: 22 chromosomes, little variation in the size of the autosomes, Y chromosomes that were larger than the X chromosomes, a chromocenter formed only by the sex chromosomes during prophase, and autosomes lacking constitutive heterochromatin. However, it is important to note that this species shows intraspecific chromosomal variation. In light of the results obtained, it is recommended that more studies be performed to characterize P. tertius. These studies will be particularly helpful in understanding this species in ecological, biological, biogeographical, and phylogenetic terms.

AB  - Background
   Chagas disease results from infection with the diploid protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. T. cruzi is highly genetically diverse, and multiclonal infections in individual hosts are common, but little studied. In this study, we explore T. cruzi infection multiclonality in the context of age, sex and clinical profile among a cohort of chronic patients, as well as paired congenital cases from Cochabamba, Bolivia and Goias, Brazil using amplicon deep sequencing technology.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   A 450bp fragment of the trypomastigote TcGP63I surface protease gene was amplified and sequenced across 70 chronic and 22 congenital cases on the Illumina MiSeq platform. In addition, a second, mitochondrial target-ND5-was sequenced across the same cohort of cases. Several million reads were generated, and sequencing read depths were normalized within patient cohorts (Goias chronic, n = 43, Goias congenital n = 2, Bolivia chronic, n = 27; Bolivia congenital, n = 20), Among chronic cases, analyses of variance indicated no clear correlation between intra-host sequence diversity and age, sex or symptoms, while principal coordinate analyses showed no clustering by symptoms between patients. Between congenital pairs, we found evidence for the transmission of multiple sequence types from mother to infant, as well as widespread instances of novel genotypes in infants. Finally, nonsynonymous to synonymous (dn:ds) nucleotide substitution ratios among sequences of TcGP63Ia and TcGP63Ib subfamilies within each cohort provided powerful evidence of strong diversifying selection at this locus.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our results shed light on the diversity of parasite DTUs within each patient, as well as the extent to which parasite strains pass between mother and foetus in congenital cases. Although we were unable to find any evidence that parasite diversity accumulates with age in our study cohorts, putative diversifying selection within members of the TcGP63I gene family suggests a link between genetic diversity within this gene family and survival in the mammalian host.

TI  - Hepatic changes by benznidazole in a specific treatment for Chagas disease
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - RANDOMIZED-TRIAL
AB  - Chagas disease (Cd) is the third most common parasitic disease that causes damage to human health. Even a century after its description by Carlos Chagas and advances in its control, it remains a neglected disease. To eradicate the parasite or reduce the parasitic load, specific treatment for Trypanosoma cruzi(T. cruzi) is advisable; benznidazole (BNZ) is the drug that is currently prescribed. The purpose of this study is to report the adverse events (AE) due to the use of BNZ as a specific treatment for Cd, with a particular focus on hepatic changes. This was an observational, cross-sectional cohort study that included patients who were treated with BNZ. The medical records of patients who joined the Grupo de Estudo em doenca de Chagas [Chagas Disease Study Group]/UNICAMP/Brazil and were treated with BNZ were reviewed for epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and AE parameters for the drug. The 204 patients who were assessed had an average age of 40.6 years +/- 13.5 years, and 104 of them were women (50.98%). Fourteen (6.86%) individuals were in the acute phase of Cd, and 190 (93.13%) were in its chronic phase. AEs occurred in 85 patients (41.66%), 35 (41.17%) of whom had AEs related to the liver, characterized by an elevation of AST liver enzymes, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase (yGT). Other AEs that were observed included the following: 48 cases of cutaneous changes (56.47%), 8 cases of epigastric pain (9.41 %), 7 cases of blood alteration (8.23%), and 3 cases of peripheral neuropathy (3.52%). Treatment was interrupted in 32 patients (37.64%) due to AD. Adverse events related to the liver secondary to the use of BNZ for Cd-specific treatment were frequent in this study and were characterized by an elevation of liver enzymes. Therefore, it is suggested that these enzymes be monitored during treatment with benznidazole.

AB  - Despite several available methodologies for Chagas disease (CD) serological screening, the main limitation of chronic CD diagnosis is the lack of effective tools for large-scale screening and point-of-care diagnosis to be used in different CD epidemiological scenarios. Taking into account that developing such a diagnostic tool will significantly improve the ability to identify CD carriers, we aimed at performing a proof-of-concept study (phase I study) to assess the use of these proteins in a point-of-care platform using serum samples from different geographical settings of Brazil and distinct clinical presentations. The diagnostic accuracy study was conducted on a panel of two WHO International Standards (IS) and 14 sera fromT. cruzi-positive and 16 fromT. cruzi-negative individuals. The results obtained with the test strips were converted to digital images, allowing quantitative comparison expressed as a relative band intensity ratio (RBI). The diagnostic potential and performance were also determined. Regardless of the geographical origin or clinical presentation, all sera withT. cruziantibodies returned positive both for IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) values was 100% for both antigens, demonstrating an outstanding overall diagnostic accuracy (100%). Based on the data, we believe that the lateral flow assays based on these antigens are promising methodologies for screening CD.

AB  - BackgroundPanstrongylus megistus is the most important vector of Chagas disease in Brazil. Studies show that the principal factor hindering the control of triatomines is reinfestation of houses previously treated with insecticides. Studies at the microgeographic level are therefore necessary to better understand these events. However, an efficient molecular marker is not yet available for carrying out such analyses in this species. The aim of the present study was to identify and characterize microsatellite loci for future population genetic studies of P. megistus.Methods This study work consisted of five stages: (i) sequencing of genomic DNA; (ii) assembly and selection of contigs containing microsatellites; (iii) validation of amplification and evaluation of polymorphic loci; (iv) standardization of the polymorphic loci; and (v) verification of cross-amplification with other triatomine species.ResultsSequencing of males and females generated 7,908,463 contigs with a total length of 2,043,422,613 bp. A total of 2,043,690 regions with microsatellites in 1,441,091 contigs were obtained, with mononucleotide repeats being the most abundant class. From a panel of 96 loci it was possible to visualize polymorphisms in 64.55% of the loci. Of the 20 loci genotyped, the number of alleles varied from two to nine with an average of 4.9. Cross-amplification with other species of triatomines was observed in 13 of the loci.ConclusionsDue to the high number of alleles encountered, polymorphism and the capacity to amplify from geographically distant populations, the microsatellites described here show promise for utilization in population genetic studies of P. megistus.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is among the top 10 causes of inability to blood donation. Blood donation centers screen for anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies using highly sensitive immunoenzymatic (ELISA) or chemiluminescent methods, which can lead to false positive results. Since positive samples cannot be used, to avoid the loss of valuable blood donations, it is necessary to improve specificity without reducing the sensitivity of the tests used for blood screening. For this purpose, our group has developed four chimeric proteins (IBMP-8.1, IBMP-8.2, IBMP-8.3, and IBMP-8.4) that have been evaluated in phase I and II studies with high performance and low cross-reactivity rates. The study included a panel of 5,014 serum samples collected from volunteer blood donors at the Hematology and Hemotherapy Foundation of the State of Bahia (Brazil). They were subjected to the detection of anti-T. cruzi antibodies, using all four IBMP antigens individually and latent class analysis (LCA) as a reference test, since there is no gold standard test for this purpose. Considering the sample size analyzed, LCA classified 4,993 (99.6%) samples as T. cruzi-negative and 21 (0.42%) as T. cruzi-positive. Sensitivity values ranged from 85.71% for IBMP-8.1 and 90.48% for IBMP-8.2-95.24% for IBMP-8.3 and 100% for IBMP-8.4, while specificity ranged from 99.98% for IBMP-8.3 and IBMP-8.4-100% for IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.2. Accuracy values ranged from 99.4 to 99.98%. The pretest probability for the molecules was 0.42, whereas the positive posttest probability ranged from 95.24 to 99.95% and the negative posttest probability ranged from 0.00001 to 0.0006% for all antigens. The higher odds ratio diagnosis was found for IBMP-8.4, which has been shown to be a safe single antigen for serological screening of CD in blood samples. The use of chimeric IBMP antigens is an alternative to reduce the number of bags discarded due to false-positive results. These molecules have high diagnostic performance and were shown to be suitable for use in screening CD in blood banks, isolated (IBMP-8.4) or in combination; and their use in blood banks could significantly reduce unnecessary disposal of blood bags or the risk of T. cruzi transmission.

AB  - Background Conservation projects in zoos may involve translocation of captive animals, which may lead to pathogen spread. Neotropical mammals are important hosts of Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. the etiological agents of Chagas disease and Leishmaniasis respectively. Studies of trypanosomatid-infected mammals and vectors (triatomines and sandflies) in zoos are important for the establishment of surveillance and control measures. Objectives We investigated trypanosomatid infections in captive wild mammals, triatomines and sandflies at the Brasilia Zoo. Methods We collected triatomines during active bimonthly surveys, sampled sandflies using light-traps and obtained blood samples from 74 mammals between 2016 and 2017. We used quantitative PCR to detect trypanosomatids in vectors and mammals. Results We found a colony of 19 Panstrongylus megistus in the porcupine unit and detected T. cruzi infections in five bugs. We captured 17 sandflies of four species including Nyssomyia whitmani and Lutzomyia longipalpis, but no Leishmania infection was detected. qPCR detected 50 T. cruzi-infected mammals belonging to 24 species and five groups of mammals (Carnivora, Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Pilosa and Primates); Leishmania DNA was detected in 23 mammals from 15 species, mainly carnivores. We detected trypanosomatid infections in 11 mammals born at the Brasilia Zoo. Conclusions Our results suggest vector-borne transmission of T. cruzi among maned wolves; measures to reduce the risk of new infections should therefore be taken. We also report sandfly presence and Leishmania-infected mammals at the Brasilia Zoo. Translocation of wild mammals in and out of the Brasilia Zoo should consider the risk of T. cruzi and Leishmania spread.

AB  - Objectives: Congenital Chagas Disease (CCD) has become a global health problem. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential for the cure of the disease. Our aim was to evaluate techniques and samples used for the diagnosis of CCD in order to improve diagnostic strategies.
   Methods: A total of 181 children born in Spain from Latin American Chagas-infected mothers were consecutively enrolled and studied by microhematocrit, PCR and serology tests at 0-2, 6 and 9-12 months of age and followed up when it was required. Samples of cord blood and peripheral blood were collected for T. cruzi detection by PCR. Parasite culture was performed in patients with a positive PCR.
   Results: Of 181 children, 7 children (3.9%) were lost to follow-up. A total of 174 children completed follow-up, 12 were diagnosed with CCD (6.9%) and 162 (93.1%) as uninfected children (negative serology tests at the end of the follow-up). Traditional parasitological diagnosis by microhematocrit had a poor performance (sensitivity was 10%), while PCR in peripheral blood showed high sensitivity (90.9%) and specificity (100%), allowing the early diagnosis of 9 infected children during the first 6-months-old. In the other 3 congenital cases, diagnosis was only possible at 12 months by serological and molecular techniques. However, PCR in cord blood showed low sensitivity (33.3%) and less specificity (96.4%) for the diagnosis.
   Conclusion: PCR in peripheral blood has proven to be the most adequate strategy for the diagnosis of CCD, allowing an early and reliable diagnosis.

AB  - Background
   Several studies addressed changes on the insect vector behavior due to parasite infection, but little is known for triatomine bugs, vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. We assessed infection rates and metacyclogenesis of T.cruzi (TcVI) in fifth-instar nymphs of Triatoma rubrovaria comparing with the primary vector Triatoma infestans. Also, biological parameters related to feeding-excretion behavior were evaluated aiming to identify which variables are most influenced by T.cruzi infection.
   Methodology/principal findings
   Fifth-instar nymphs of T.rubrovaria and T.infestans were fed on mice infected with T. cruzi(TcVI). We compared the presence and the number of parasite evolutive forms in excreta of both triatomine species at 30, 60 and 90 days post-infection (dpi) with traditional statistical analyses. Moreover, both species were analyzed through generalized linear models and multinomial logistic regression hypotheses for seven behavioral parameters related to host-seeking and feeding-excretion. Triatoma rubrovaria and T.infestans had similar overall infection and metacyclogenesis rates of T.cruzi TcVI in laboratory conditions. Regarding vector behavior, we confirmed that the triatomine's tendency is to move away from the bite region after a blood meal, probably to avoid being noticed by the vertebrate host. Interspecific differences were observed on the volume of blood ingested and on the proportion of individuals that excreted after the blood meal, revealing the higher feeding efficiency and dejection rates of T.infestans. The amount of ingested blood and the bite behavior of T.rubrovaria seems to be influenced by TcVI infection. Infected specimens tended to ingest similar to 25% more blood and to bite more the head of the host. Noteworthy, in two occasions, kleptohematophagy and coprophagy behaviors were also observed in T. rubrovaria.
   Conclusions/significance
   Laboratory infections revealed similar rate of T.cruzi VI trypomatigotes in excreta of T.rubrovaria and T. infestans, one of the most epidemiological important vectors of T. cruzi. Therefore, TcVI DTU was able to complete its life cycle in T. rubrovaria under laboratory conditions, and this infection changed the feeding behavior of T. rubrovaria. Considering these results,T. rubrovaria must be kept under constant entomological surveillance in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

AB  - Objective: To determine the course of serological tests in subjects with chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection treated with anti-trypanosomal drugs.
   Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using individual participant data. Survival analysis and the Cox proportional hazards regression model with random effects to adjust for covariates were applied. The protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO; CRD42012002162).
   Results: A total of 27 studies (1296 subjects) conducted in eight countries were included. The risk of bias was low for all domains in 17 studies (63.0%). Nine hundred and thirteen subjects were assessed (149 seroreversion events, 83.7% censored data) for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), 670 subjects (134 events, 80.0% censored) for indirect immunofluorescence assay (IIF), and 548 subjects (99 events, 82.0% censored) for indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA). A higher probability of seroreversion was observed within a shorter time span in subjects aged 1-19 years compared to adults. The chance of seroreversion also varied according to the country where the infection might have been acquired. For instance, the pooled adjusted hazard ratio between children/adolescents and adults for the IIF test was 1.54 (95% confidence interval 0.64-3.71) for certain countries of South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Paraguay) and 9.37 (95% confidence interval 3.44-25.50) for Brazil.
   Conclusions: The disappearance of anti-T. cruzi antibodies was demonstrated along the course of follow-up. An interaction between age at treatment and country setting was found. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) still represents a serious public health problem in Brazil due to the inefficiency of the control measures currently employed, that included early diagnosis and treatment of human cases, vector control, euthanasia of infected dogs and, recently approved in Brazil, treatment with Milteforam drug. Effective clinical management depend largely on early and unequivocal diagnosis, however, cross-reactivity have also been described in serological tests, especially when it refers to individuals from areas where Chagas' disease is also present. Thus, to discover new antigens to improve the current serological tests for VL diagnosis is urgently needed. Here, we performed an immunogenomic screen strategy to identify conserved linear B-cell epitopes in the predicted L. infantum proteome using the following criteria: i) proteins expressed in the stages found in the vertebrate host, amastigote stage, and secreted/excreted, to guarantee greater exposure to the immune system; ii) divergent from proteins present in other infectious disease pathogens with incidence in endemic areas for VL, as T. cruzi; iii) highly antigenic to humans with different genetic backgrounds, independently of the clinical stage of the disease; iv) stable and adaptable to quality-control tests to guarantee reproducibility; v) using statistical analysis to determine a suitable sample size to evaluate accuracy of diagnostic tests established by receiver operating characteristic strategy. We selected six predicted linear B-cell epitopes from three proteins of L. infantum parasite. The results demonstrated that a mixture of peptides (Mix IV: peptides 3+6) were able to identify VL cases and simultaneously able to discriminate infections caused by T. cruzi parasite with high accuracy (100.00%) and perfect agreement (Kappa index = 1.000) with direct methods performed by laboratories in Brazil. The results also demonstrated that peptide-6, Mix III (peptides 2+6) and I (peptides 2+3+6) are potential antigens able to used in VL diagnosis, represented by high accuracy (Ac = 99.52%, 99.52% and 98.56%, respectively). This study represents an interesting strategy for discovery new antigens applied to serologic diagnosis which will contribute to the improvement of the diagnosis of VL and, consequently, may help in the prevention, control and treatment of the disease in endemic areas of Brazil.

AB  - Background: Outbreaks of acute Chagas disease by oral infection have been reported frequently over the last ten years, with higher incidence in northern South America, where Trypanosoma cruzi lineage TcI predominates, being responsible for the major cause of resurgent human disease, and a small percentage is identified as TcIV. Mechanisms of oral infection and host-cell invasion by these parasites are poorly understood. To address that question, we analyzed T. cruzi strains isolated from chagasic patients in Venezuela, Guatemala and Brazil.
   Methods: Trypanosoma cruzi metacyclic trypomastigotes were orally inoculated into mice. The mouse stomach collected four days later, as well as the stomach and the heart collected 30 days post-infection, were processed for histological analysis. Assays to mimic parasite migration through the gastric mucus layer were performed by counting the parasites that traversed gastric mucin-coated transwell filters. For cell invasion assays, human epithelial HeLa cells were incubated with metacyclic forms and the number of internalized parasites was counted.
   Results: All TcI and TcIV T. cruzi strains were poorly infective by the oral route. Parasites were either undetectable or were detected in small numbers in the mouse stomach four days post oral administration. Replicating parasites were found in the stomach and/or in the heart 30 days post-infection. As compared to TcI lineage, the migration capacity of TcIV parasites through the gastric mucin-coated filter was higher but lower than that exhibited by TcVI metacyclic forms previously shown to be highly infective by the oral route. Expression of pepsin-resistant gp90, the surface molecule that downregulates cell invasion, was higher in TcI than in TcIV parasites and, accordingly, the invasion capacity of TcIV metacyclic forms was higher. Gp90 molecules spontaneously released by TcI metacyclic forms inhibited the parasite entry into host cells. TcI parasites exhibited low intracellular replication rate.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the poor capacity of TcI lineage, and to a lesser degree of TcIV parasites, in invading gastric epithelium after oral infection of mice may be associated with the inefficiency of metacyclic forms, in particular of TcI parasites, to migrate through the gastric mucus layer, to invade target epithelial cells and to replicate intracellularly.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. One-third of infected patients will develop the cardiac form, which may progress to heart failure (HF). However, the factors that determine disease progression remain unclear. Increased angiotensin II activity is a key player in the pathophysiology of HF. A functional polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with plasma enzyme activity. In CD, ACE inhibitors have beneficial effects supporting the use of this treatment in chagasic cardiomyopathy. Methods: We evaluated the association of ACE I/D polymorphism with HF, performing a case-control study encompassing 343 patients with positive serology for CD staged as non-cardiomyopathy (stage A; 100), mild (stage B1; 144), and severe (stage C; 99) forms of Chagas heart disease. For ACE I/D genotyping by PCR, groups were compared using unconditional logistic regression analysis and adjusted for nongenetic covariates: age, sex, and trypanocidal treatment. Results: A marginal, but not significant (p=0.06) higher prevalence of ACE I/D polymorphism was observed in patients in stage C compared with patients in stage A. Patients in stage C (CD with HF), were compared with patients in stages A and B1 combined into one group (CD without HF); DD genotype/D carriers were prevalent in the HF patients (OR = 2; CI = 1.013.96; p = 0.04). Conclusions: Our results of this cohort study, comprising a population from the Northeast region of Brazil, suggest that ACE I/D polymorphism is more prevalent in the cardiac form of Chagas disease with HF.

AB  - The WHO recommends screening of Latin American migrants for Chagas disease to reduce morbidity and mortality and increase the likelihood of eradicating the disease. The objective was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a screening strategy in one Swiss canton. From February 2011 to September 2012, people attending six healthcare centres of different types were offered a rapid diagnostic test if they or their mother were of Latin American origin (or, at the blood donation centre, if they had travelled for = 1 year in Latin America). In addition, testing was offered during events where Latin Americans gathered. In total, 1,010 people were tested, mainly originating from Brazil (24%), Ecuador (13%) and Chile (10%). 54% were born in Latin America, 15% had a Latin American mother, and 29% were travellers. The prevalence of Chagas disease was 2.3% among migrants (15.5% in the community testing) and 0% among travellers. The prevalence was 18.0%, 0.8%, 0.5% and 0% among Bolivians, Ecuadorians, Brazilians and other countries respectively. Predictors for Chagas disease were: born in Latin America (OR = infinite, p < 0.001), Bolivian origin (OR = 95, 95% CI: 19-482, p < 0.001), being tested in the community (OR = 56, 95% CI: 14-218, p < 0.001), and age > 35 years OR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.1-10.5, p = 0.03). The prevalence of Chagas disease was much higher in people attending social events than healthcare centres, suggesting that observations based only on health facility data underestimate the real prevalence of Chagas disease. Screening in the community was well accepted and should be promoted to reach the population at highest risk.

AB  - Background:Outbreaks of Chagas disease (CD) by foodborne transmission is a problem related to deforestation, exposing people to triatomines infected by T. cruzi, in the Amazon region. Once involving long-time follow-up, the treatment efficacy of the CD during its acute phase is still unknown. The authors aim to describe the clinical and epidemiologic profile of children and adolescents with CD, as well as treatment and cardiac involvement during the follow-up.Methods: A descriptive cohort study was conducted from 1998 to 2013 among children and adolescents up to 18 years-old with confirmed diagnosis of CD. All participants met the criteria of CD in the acute phase.Results: A total of 126 outpatients were included and received treatment and follow-up examinations during a medium period of 10.9 years/person. Most of them (68.3%) had their diagnosis established during oral transmission outbreaks. The diagnostic method with the most positive results rate (80.9%) was the IgM class anti-T. cruziantibody test as an acute phase marker, followed by the thick blood smears (60.8%). Acute myopericarditis was demonstrated in 18.2% of the patients, most of them with favorable evolution, though 2.4% (3/126) persisted with cardiac injury observed at the end point of the follow-up.Conclusions: Antibodies againstT. cruzipersisted in 54.8% of sera from the patients without prognostic correlation with cardiac involvement. Precocious treatment can decrease potential cardiac complications and assure good treatment response, especially for inhabitants living in areas with difficult accessibility.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is a serious public health problem in Latin America and its treatment remains neglected. Benznidazole (BZ), the only drug available in Brazil, presents serious side effects and low therapeutic efficacy, especially at the chronic phase. The last clinical trials demonstrated that the first generation of azole compounds were less successful than BZ in CD chemotherapy, which stimulated studies of these compounds associated to BZ and nifurtimox (NF). This study evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of BZ, itraconazole (ITZ) and their combination (BZ + ITZ) in dogs infected with the VL-10 T. cruzi strain in the acute phase of the disease. Twenty young mongrel dogs were inoculated with 2.0 x 10(3) blood trypomastigotes/kg and divided into four groups: treated with BZ, ITZ and BZ + ITZ for 60 days, and control group (INT). The parasitemia of the BZ + ITZ and BZ groups were similar and showed significant reduction compared to the INT group. The group treated with ITZ also showed significant parasitemia reduction compared to the INT group. The global analysis of hemoculture (HC), blood PCR, conventional serology (CS-ELISA), heart qPCR and histopathology techniques, used in the post-treatment evaluation, revealed that BZ + ITZ combination lead to a more reduction of parasitemia during the acute phase and heart qPCR positivity, less cardiac damage (inflammation and fibrosis in the left ventricle) and total survival. According to the classical cure criteria one animal treated with BZ + ITZ can be considered cured in its final evaluation and two other dogs, one of this group and one treated with ITZ were in process of cure. At least for BZ-resistant T. cruzi strains such as VL-10, BZ + ITZ was not effective to induce parasitological cure or a profound and sustained reduction of the parasite burden in blood and infected organs.

AB  - Molecular phylogenetic studies have revealed the growing diversity of bat trypanosomes. Here, 14 isolates from blood samples of the vampire bat Desmodus rotundus (Phyllostomidae) from Rio de Janeiro, Southeast Brazil, were cultivated, and morphologically and molecularly characterized. All isolates represent a novel species named Trypanosoma madeirae n. sp. positioned in the Neobat lineage of the clade T. cruzi. The Neobat lineage also comprises closely related trypanosomes of clades Neotropic 1, 2 and 3 from diverse phyllostomid species. Trypanosomes of Neotropic 1, found in Trachops cirrhosus and Artibeus jamaicensis (phyllostomids), likely represent a different species or genotype closely related to T. madeirae. Consistent with its phylogenetic positioning, T. madeirae differs from Trypanosoma cruzi in morphology of both epimastigote and trypomastigote culture forms and does not infect Triatoma infestans. Similar to its closest relatives of Neobat lineage, T. madeirae was unable to develop within mammalian cells. To date, PCR-surveys on archived blood/liver samples unveiled T. madeirae exclusively in D. rotundus from Southern to Northern Brazil. The description of a new species of bat trypanosome associated with vampire bats increases the repertoire of trypanosomes infecting D. rotundus, currently comprised of Trypanosoma cruzi, T. cruzi marinkellei, Trypanosoma dionisii, Trypanosoma rangeli, Trypanosoma pessoai, and Trypanosoma madeirae.

AB  - Porcelia macrocarpa (Warm.) R. E. Fries (Annonaceae) is an endemic plant in Brazil where its tasty pulp has been eaten fresh. The hexane extract from its flowers was subjected to chromatographic procedures to afford four acetylene derivatives identified as octadec-9-ynoic (stearolic acid - 1), (11E)-octadec-11en- 9-ynoic (santalbic acid - 2), 8-hydroxyoctadec-9,11-diynoic (3) and 8-hydroxyoctadec-17-en-9,11-d iynoic (isanolic acid - 4) acids by NMR and HRESIMS. Among tested compounds against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi, octadec-9-ynoic acid (1) displayed higher potential with IC50 = 27.6 mu M and a selectivity index (SI) higher than 7. Compounds 2 and 3 showed IC50 of approximately 60 mM while compound 4 was inactive. The lethal action of the compound 1 was investigated using spectrofluorometric techniques to detect ROS content, plasma membrane permeability and plasma membrane potential by flow cytometry. Compound 1 showed no alteration in the production of ROS of treated trypomastigotes and no alteration of the plasma membrane permeability was observed as detected by the fluorescent probe SYTOX-green after 120 min of incubation. However, by using the potential-sensitive fluorescent probe DiSBAC(2)(3), compound 1 caused depolarization of the plasma membrane potential when compared to untreated parasites. Our results demonstrated the anti-T. cruzi effects of compounds 1-3 isolated from flowers of P. macrocarpa and indicated that the lethal effect of compound 1 in T. cruzi could be associated to the plasma membrane disturbance of the parasite.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is a serious public health problem in Latin America and its treatment remains neglected. Benznidazole (BZ) available in Brazil, presents serious side effects and low therapeutic efficacy at chronic phase. This study evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of BZ, itraconazole (ITZ) and BZ + ITZ in dogs infected with VL-10 T. cruzi strain in the acute phase (Ethic protocol number 2013/28). Twenty young mongrel dogs were inoculated with 2.0 x 10(3) blood trypomastigotes/kg and divided into four groups: treated with BZ, ITZ and BZ + ITZ for 60 days, and control group (INT-infected not treated). The parasitemia of the BZ + ITZ and BZ groups were similar and showed significant reduction compared to the INT group. The ITZ group also showed significant parasitemia reduction compared to the INT group. For cure control the global analysis of hemoculture (HC), blood PCR, conventional serology (CS-ELISA), heart qPCR and histopathology revealed that BZ + ITZ lead to more reduction of parasitemia during the acute phase and heart qPCR positivity, less cardiac damage and total survival than BZ or ITZ. Moreover, two other dogs, one treated with ITZ and other treated with BZ + ITZ, were always negative in all parasitological tests what indicates parasitological cure or that these dogs are in process of cure.
   BZ + ITZ lead to more reduction of parasitemia, total survival, less heart qPCR positivity and cardiac damage.
   According to the classic cure criterion cure was observed only in one dog submitted to BZ + ITZ treatment.
   Two dogs, one treated with ITZ and other treated with BZ + ITZ were always parasitologically negative. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study which is part of a research project on Chagas disease (CD) among Bolivian immigrants in Sao Paulo, we describe socioeconomic characteristics, knowledge of CD and implications for acess to health care. We applied a structured questionnaire to a sample of 472 Bolivian adults (> 18 years) living in Sao Paulo and enrolled at the Barra Funda School Health Center. Participants' median age was 28.5 years, 75.0% were from the Bolivian department of La Paz, and >90% worked in the garment industry. Respondents had lived in Sao Paulo for a median of 5.8 years. Only 169 (35.8%) were familiar with CD, while roughly half (50.4%) had lived in natural materials houses in Bolivia, 225 (47.7%) indicated familiarity with the vector, 23.9% had seen the vector in their homes in Bolivia, and 6.4% reported having been bitten by a triatomine hug. Factors associated with awareness of CI) were analyzed by chi square tests, and those with p values <0.25 were included in a multivariable logistic regression model. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, having a relative with CD (OR=4.3, 95% CI=1.5-12.0), having lived in a house with mud or wood walls (OR=0.4, 95% CI=0.2-0.8), and having heard of the triatomine bug, or vinchuca, (OR=10.0, 95% CI=5.1-19.5) were significantly associated with awareness of CD. This study shows a low familiarity with CD among Bolivian migrants living in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Raising awareness of the disease through specific communication strategies should be an essential component of public health programs to reduce the burden of CD in this and other vulnerable populations.

AB  - Background: Triatomines (Hemiptera, Reduviidae) are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, one of the most important vector-borne diseases in Latin America. This study compares the environmental niche spaces of Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma melanica using ecological niche modelling and reports findings on DNA barcoding and wing geometric morphometrics as tools for the identification of these species.
   Methods: We compared the geographic distribution of the species using generalized linear models fitted to elevation and current data on land surface temperature, vegetation cover and rainfall recorded by earth observation satellites for northeastern Brazil. Additionally, we evaluated nucleotide sequence data from the barcode region of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CO1) and wing geometric morphometrics as taxonomic identification tools for T. brasiliensis and T. melanica.
   Results: The ecological niche models show that the environmental spaces currently occupied by T. brasiliensis and T. melanica are similar although not equivalent, and associated with the caatinga ecosystem. The CO1 sequence analyses based on pair wise genetic distance matrix calculated using Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) evolutionary model, clearly separate the two species, supporting the barcoding gap. Wing size and shape analyses based on seven landmarks of 72 field specimens confirmed consistent differences between T. brasiliensis and T. melanica.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that the separation of the two species should be attributed to a factor that does not include the current environmental conditions. However, as the caatinga is a biome that has existed in the area for at least the last 18,000 years, past conditions might have had an influence in the speciation process. The DNA Barcoding approach may be extended to these members of the subfamily Triatominae.

AB  - Ecoepidemiological scenarios for Chagas disease transmission are complex, so vector control measures to decrease human-vector contact and prevent infection transmission are difficult to implement in all geographic contexts. This study assessed the geographic abundance patterns of two vector species of Chagas disease: Triatoma maculata (Erichson, 1848) and Rhodnius pallescens (Barber, 1932) in Latin America. We modeled their potential distribution using the maximum entropy algorithm implemented in Maxent and calculated distances to their niche centroid by fitting a minimum-volume ellipsoid. In addition, to determine which method would accurately explain geographic abundance patterns, we compared the correlation between population abundance and the distance to the ecological niche centroid (DNC) and between population abundance and Maxent environmental suitability. The potential distribution estimated for T. maculata showed that environmental suitability covers a large area, from Panama to Northern Brazil. R. pallescens showed a more restricted potential distribution, with environmental suitability covering mostly the coastal zone of Costa Rica and some areas in Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, northern Colombia, Acre, and Rondonia states in Brazil, as well as a small region of the western Brazilian Amazon. We found a negative slope in the relationship between population abundance and the DNC in both species. R. pallecens has a more extensive potential latitudinal range than previously reported, and the distribution model for T. maculata corroborates previous studies. In addition, population abundance increases according to the niche centroid proximity, indicating that population abundance is limited by the set of scenopoetic variables at coarser scales (non-interactive variables) used to determine the ecological niche. These findings might be used by public health agencies in Latin America to implement actions and support programs for disease prevention and vector control, identifying areas in which to expand entomological surveillance and maintain chemical control, in order to decrease human-vector contact.

AB  - Natural products are a very important source of bio-molecules for drug to treat infectious diseases. The essential oil of Eugenia dysenterica DC. dried leaves (Ed-EO), of the Myrtaceae family, was analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector (GC/FID) and by mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in order to identify their volatile components. A total of 24 compounds were identified from Ed-EO. The major compounds found in Ed-EO were limonene (16.0 %), caryophyllene oxide (15.0 %), citral (9.0 %), trans-caryophyllene (8.0 %), and 1,8-cineole (7.3 %). The in vitro biological activities of Ed-EO were investigated against trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi and bacteria of the genus Streptococcus. Our results demonstrated that Ed-EO, tested against T. cruzi, affected trypomastigote growth in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 of Ed-EO was 9.5 mu g/mL, while the IC50 of benznidazole (positive control) was 9.8 mu g/mL, revealing remarkable trypanocidal action. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the broth dilution method in 96-well microplates. The Ed-EO displayed moderate antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mitis (MIC = 250 mu g/mL), S. sanguinis (MIC = 200 mu g/mL), S. sobrinus (MIC = 400 mu g/mL), and S. salivarius (MIC = 400 mu g/mL), and strong activity against S. mutans (MIC = 31.2 mu g/mL). These results suggest that the oil of E. dysenterica dried leaves could be tested in future studies for the treatment of Chagas disease and dental caries.

AB  - Background In Brazil, Triatoma maculata is only found in the State of Roraima and is a vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. It occurs in wild, peridomestic and domestic habitats, with an urban infestation in Boa Vista, the capital of this Brazilian state. The aim of this study was to assess the morphological variability of the T. maculata antennal phenotype in three populations of Roraima State, using the antennal sensilla pattern analyzed under optical microscopy. Methods The number and distribution of four antennal sensilla types (bristles, thin and thick walled trichoidea, and basiconic) of three Brazilian populations of T. maculata from Roraima State were compared. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results The antenna of T. maculata presented the four types of sensilla. According to the density and distribution of the antennal sensilla characteristics, the multivariate analyses showed that the laboratory population is morphologically structured. Urban specimens showed a pronounced phenotypic variability. The main differences were observed in the pedicel segment, and between males and females. Conclusions We determined the antennal phenotype in three Roraima populations of T. maculata. These results support the idea that the patterns of antennal sensilla are sensitive markers for distinct populations in the Triatominae. The infestations of T. maculata in different habitats reinforces the ability of this vector to become adapted to a variety of environments, which, could have eco-epidemiological implications for the T. cruzi transmission that are still not well understood.

AB  - Despite the current treatments against Chagas Disease (CD), this vector-borne parasitic disease remains a serious public health concern. In this study, we have explored the in vitro and/or in vivo trypanocidal and cytotoxic activities of the essential oils (EOs) obtained from Dysphania ambrosioides (L.) Mosyakin & Clemants (Amaranthaceae) (DA-EO), Lippia alba (Mill.) N.E. Brown (Verbenaceae) (LA-EO), and Tetradenia riparia (Hochst.) Codd (Lamiaceae) (TR-EO) grown in Brazil Southeast. DA-EO was the most active against the trypomastigote and amastigote forms in vitro; the IC50 values were 8.7 and 12.2 mu g mL(-1), respectively. The EOs displayed moderate toxicity against LLCMK2 cells, but the DA-EO showed high selectivity index (SI) for trypomastigote (SI=33.2) and amastigote (SI=11.7) forms. Treatment with 20 mg/kg DA-EO, LA-EO, or TR-EO for 20 days by intraperitoneal administration reduced parasitemia by 6.36 %, 4.74 %, and 32.68 % on day 7 and by 12.04 %, 27.96 %, and 65.5 % on day 9. These results indicated that DA-EO, LA-EO, and TR-EO have promising trypanocidal potential in vitro, whereas TR-EO has also potential trypanocidal effects in vivo.

AB  - Congenital infection of Trypanosoma cruzi allows transmission of this parasite through generations. Despite the problematic that this entails, little is known about the placenta environment genetic response produced against infection. We performed functional genomics by microarray analysis in C57Bl/6J mice comparing placentas from uninfected animals and from animals infected with two different T. cruzi strains: K98, a clone of the non-lethal myotropic CA-I strain (TcI), and VD (TcVI), isolated from a human case of congenital infection. Analysis of networks by GeneMANIA of differentially expressed genes showed that "Secretory Granule "was a pathway down-regulated in both infected groups, whereas "Innate Immune Response "and "Response to Interferon-gamma "were pathways up-regulated in VD infection but not in K98. Applying another approach, the GSEA algorithm that detects small changes in predetermined gene sets, we found that metabolic processes, transcription and macromolecular transport were down-regulated in infected placentas environment and some pathways related to cascade signaling had opposite regulation: over-represented in VD and down-regulated in K98 group. We also have found a stronger tropism to the placental organ by VD strain, by detection of parasite DNA and RNA, suggesting living parasites. Our study is the first one to describe in a murine model the genetic response of placental environment to T. cruzi infection and suggests the development of a strong immune response, parasite genotype-dependent, to the detriment of cellular metabolism, which may contribute to control infection preventing the risk of congenital transmission.

AB  - BACKGROUND The severity of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC), the most frequent clinical outcome of Chagas disease (CD), has been associated with cytokine-enriched heart tissue inflammation, and high serum levels of transforming growth factor (TGF beta), interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Conversely, increased interleukin (IL)-10 serum concentrations have been associated with asymptomatic CD. Cytokines and cytokine-related gene polymorphisms may control cytokine expression and have been proposed to contribute to CCC outcomes.
   OBJECTIVES We evaluated the association of 13 cytokine-related genes (TGFB: rs8179181, rs8105161, rs1800469; IL10: rs1800890, rs1800871, rs1800896; IFNG: rs2430561; TNF: rs1800629; BAT1: rs3853601; LTA: rs909253, rs2239704; TNFR1: rs767455; TNFR2: rs1061624) with risk and progression of CCC.
   FINDINGS Four hundred and six seropositive patients from CD endemic areas in the state of Pernambuco, north-eastern Brazil, were classified as non-cardiopathic (A, 110) or cardiopathic (mild, B1, 163; severe, C, 133). We found no evidence of TGFB, IL10, TNF, or TNFR1/2 gene polymorphisms associated with CCC risk or progression. Only BAT1 rs3853601 -22G carriers (B1 vs. C: OR = 0.5; p-value = 0.03) and IFNG rs2430561 +874AT (A vs. C: OR = 0.7; p-value = 0.03; A vs. Bl+C: OR = 0.8; p-value = 0.02) showed a significant association with protection from cardiopathy in a logistic regression analysis with adjustment for gender and ethnicity; however, the association disappeared after performing adjustment for multiple testing. A systematic review of TNF rs1800629 -308G>A publications included five studies for meta-analysis (534 CCC and 472 asymptomatic patients) and showed no consensus in pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates for A allele or A carriers (OR = 1.4 and 1.5; p-values = 0.14 and 0.15, respectively). In CD patients, TNF serum levels were increased, but not affected by the TNF rs1800629 -308A allele.
   MAIN CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest no significant contribution of the analysed gene variants of cytokine-related molecules to development/severity of Chagas heart disease, reinforcing the idea that parasite/host interplay is critical to CD outcomes.

AB  - Background
   Tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) is a disease of skin and/or mucosal tissues caused by Leishmania parasites. TL patients may concurrently carry other pathogens, which may influence the clinical outcome of TL.
   Methodology and principal findings
   This review focuses on the frequency of TL coinfections in human populations, interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens in animal models and human subjects, and implications of TL coinfections for clinical practice. For the purpose of this review, TL is defined as all forms of cutaneous (localised, disseminated, or diffuse) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, superinfection with skin bacteria, and skin manifestations of visceral leishmaniasis are not included. We searched MEDLINE and other databases and included 73 records: 21 experimental studies in animals and 52 studies about human subjects (mainly cross-sectional and case studies). Several reports describe the frequency of Trypanosoma cruzi coinfection in TL patients in Argentina (about 41%) and the frequency of helminthiasis in TL patients in Brazil (15% to 88%). Different hypotheses have been explored about mechanisms of interaction between different microorganisms, but no clear answers emerge. Such interactions may involve innate immunity coupled with regulatory networks that affect quality and quantity of acquired immune responses. Diagnostic problems may occur when concurrent infections cause similar lesions (e.g., TL and leprosy), when different pathogens are present in the same lesions (e.g., Leishmania and Sporothrix schenckii), or when similarities between phylogenetically close pathogens affect accuracy of diagnostic tests (e.g., serology for leishmaniasis and Chagas disease). Some coinfections (e.g., helminthiasis) appear to reduce the effectiveness of antileishmanial treatment, and drug combinations may cause cumulative adverse effects.
   Conclusions and significance
   In patients with TL, coinfection is frequent, it can lead to diagnostic errors and delays, and it can influence the effectiveness and safety of treatment. More research is needed to unravel how coinfections interfere with the pathogenesis of TL.

AB  - Triatomines are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, which affects between 6 and 12 million people in Latin America, with an incidence rate of 12 thousand cases per year. In the Ceara State, the predominance of the caatinga biome, coupled with a large rural area with precarious human habitations, provides several s shelters for these insects. In this study, we determined the spatiotemporal distribution of triatomine dispersion rates in the Cariri region, Southern Ceara and ascertained the possible association between these rates with socioeconomic and environmental factors. Dispersion rates (number of positive localities/number of searched localities x 100) were analyzed regarding 13 municipalities from the Ceara State, from 2009 to 2013. Socioeconomic and environmental variables collected from national research institutes were associated with the dispersion rates and their local empirical Bayesian estimates. All the municipalities recorded dispersion rates over 10% in all years, and 11 municipalities had average rates over 40% for the period of study. Significant differences were observed among the municipality means. The highest rates were observed in Antonina do Norte and Potengi. According to the correlation analysis, the proportion between the occupied population and the total population showed a significant negative correlation, as well as the percentage of the population who lives under adequate sanitary conditions. Both, the percentage of revenues from external sources and the percentage of urban households in reforested blocks had a significant positive correlation. Our results show that socioeconomic and environmental variables can be factors that contribute to both, the maintenance and the reduction of the elevated dispersion rates observed in the study area. Similar researches that encompass more municipalities from that region may reinforce Chagas disease surveillance and control in the Northeast of Brazil.

AB  - Chagas disease is responsible for more than 10,000 deaths per year and about 6 to 7 million infected people worldwide. In its chronic stage, patients can develop mega-colon, mega-esophagus, and cardiomyopathy. Differences in clinical outcomes may be determined, in part, by the genetic background of the parasite that causes Chagas disease.Trypanosoma cruzihas a high genetic diversity, and each group of strains may elicit specific pathological responses in the host. Conflicting results have been reported in studies using various combinations of mammalian host-T. cruzistrains. We previously profiled the transcriptomic signatures resulting from infection of L6E9 rat myoblasts with four reference strains ofT. cruzi(Brazil, CL, Y, and Tulahuen). The four strains induced similar overall gene expression alterations in the myoblasts, although only 21 genes were equally affected by all strains.Cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1(Clcf1) was one of the genes found to be consistently upregulated by the infection with all four strains ofT. cruzi. This cytokine is a member of the interleukin-6 family that binds to glycoprotein 130 receptor and activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which may lead to muscle cell hypertrophy. Another commonly upregulated gene was tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein theta (Ywhaq, 14-3-3 protein Theta), present in the Cell Cycle Pathway. In the present work, we reanalyzed our previous microarray dataset, aiming at understanding in more details the transcriptomic impact that each strain has on JAK/STAT signaling and Cell Cycle pathways. Using Pearson correlation analysis between the expression levels of gene pairs in biological replicas from each pathway, we determined the coordination between such pairs in each experimental condition and the predicted protein interactions between the significantly altered genes by each strain. We found that although these highlighted genes were similarly affected by all four strains, the downstream genes or their interaction partners were not necessarily equally affected, thus reinforcing the idea of the role of parasite background on host cell transcriptome. These new analyses provide further evidence to the mechanistic understanding of how distinctT. cruzistrains lead to diverse remodeling of host cell transcriptome.

AB  - Background: The rapid spread of drug-resistant strains of protozoan parasites required the urgent need for new effective drugs. Natural products offer a variety of chemical structures, which make them a valuable source of lead compounds for the development of such new drugs. Cerrado is the second largest biome in Brazil and has the richest flora of all the world savannahs. We selected Qualea grandiflora, a plant species known for its proprieties in folk medicine and its antibacterial activity. Objective: However, its antiprotozoal activity was not yet explored. Materials and Methods: We investigated the activities of fractions from the ethyl acetate extract of Q. grandiflora leaves against human life forms of Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, and for its cytotoxicity upon the rat L6-myoblast cell line. Ten fractions were produced by ethyl acetate: hexane chromatography. Results and Conclusion: The fractions showed no cytotoxicity against L-6 cells (IC50 > 100 mu g/mL) and no hemolysis propriety. Three fractions had a moderate activity against P. falciparum, anyone was active against T. cruzi but four fractions demonstrated a high activity against bloodstream forms of T. brucei gambiense (8.0< IC50 < 15 mu g/mL). Identification and characterization of the active compounds are currently under investigation.

AB  - The COVID-19 virus infection caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Brazil, in March 2020. Until the end of 2021, 504,399 COVID-19 cases were confirmed in RJ, and the total death toll reached 68,347. The Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases from Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (INI-Fiocruz) is a referral center for treatment and research of several infectious diseases, including COVID-19 and Chagas disease (CD). The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on in-hospital mortality of patients with CD during the COVID-19 pandemic period. This observational, retrospective, longitudinal study evaluated all patients with CD hospitalized at INI-Fiocruz from May 1, 2020, to November 30, 2021. One hundred ten hospitalizations from 81 patients with CD (58% women; 68 +/- 11 years) were evaluated. Death was the study's main outcome, which occurred in 20 cases. The mixed-effects logistic regression was performed with the following variables to test whether patients admitted to the hospital with a COVID-19 diagnosis would be more likely to die than those admitted with other diagnoses: admission diagnosis, sex, age, COVID-19 vaccination status, CD clinical classification, and the number of comorbidities. Results from multiple logistic regression analysis showed a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (OR 6.37; 95% CI 1.78-22.86) compared to other causes of admissions. In conclusion, COVID-19 infection had a significant impact on the mortality risk of INI-Fiocruz CD patients, accounting for one-third of deaths overall. COVID-19 presented the highest percentage of death significantly higher than those admitted due to other causes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Chagas disease has spread throughout the world mainly because of the migration of infected individuals. In Brazil, only benznidazole (Bnz) is used; however, it is toxic and not active in the chronic phase, and cases of resistance are described. This work aimed at the synthesis and the trypanocidal evaluation in vitro and in vivo of six new Bnz analogues (3-8). They were designed by exploring the bioisosteric substitution between the amide group contained in Bnz and the 1,2,3-triazole ring. All the compounds were synthesized in good yields. With the exception of compound 7, the in vitro biological evaluation shows that all Bnz analogues were active against the amastigote form, whereas only compounds 3, 4, 5, and 8 were active against trypomastigote. Compounds 4 and 5 showed the most promising activities in vitro against the form of trypomastigote, being more active than Bnz. In vivo evaluation of compounds, 3-8 showed lower potency and higher toxicity than Bnz. Although the 1,2,3-triazole ring has been described in the literature as an amide bioisostere, its substitution here has reduced the activity of the compounds and made them more toxic. Thus, further molecular optimization could provide novel therapeutic agents for Chagas' disease.

AB  - The choice of cost-effective molecular methods for diagnosing and monitoring of Chagas disease before and after treatment is crucial in endemic countries with high patients' demand and limited financial resources. To this end, a kDNA was compared to a satellite real-time quantitative PCR (sat-qPCR), both amplifications using Sybr Green instead of Taqman hydrolysis probes. Non-isogenic Swiss albino mice were infected with a small inoculum of the highly virulent and partially resistant to benznidazole Y strain, belonging to T. cruzi discrete typing unit II (DTU-II) that predominates in Atlantic and Central Brazil. DNA from EDTA-blood samples and 10 organs of mice containing high, moderate and low parasite load levels were extracted by a highly used commercial kit and tested in triplicate, showing no disagreements between the two qPCRs. The melting temperature of positive samples was 79.8 degrees C +/- 1 degrees C for satellite-DNA and 78.1 degrees C +/- 1 degrees C for kDNA. DNA from genetically-related parasites such as Leishmania sp. showed no cross-reactions, but the sympatric T. rangeli was detected by both qPCRs, more effectively by kDNA than the satellite system, which required the equivalent of 50 parasites to give a positive result. Samples from infected mice, regardless of the type of biological matrix (blood or organ samples) or the parasite load gave positive results by both qPCRs. The sensitivity of sat-qPCR was 2 x 10(-3) parasite or 240 target copies, and for kDNA, 2 x 10(-4) parasite or 24 target copies. Regarding repeatability and reproducibility, the coefficient of variation (CV) was always < 25% in both assays; linearity of sat-qPCR was 0.991 (+/-0.002) and 0.991 (+/-0.008) for kDNA qPCR. In most collection times, the median Ct values found in blood and organs provided by sat-DNA and kDNA qPCRs were similar. In conclusion, although kDNA qPCR achieved a better analytical sensitivity, sat-qPCR gave better specificity results. Nevertheless, further research is intended to test other T. cruzi DTUs and chagasic patients' samples before these cost-effective techniques are incorporated into diagnostic routines.

AB  - Triatoma sordida is a species that transmits Trypanosoma cruzi to humans. In Brazil, T. sordida currently deserves special attention because of its wide distribution, tendency to invade domestic environments and vectorial competence. For the planning and execution of control protocols to be effective against Triatominae, they must consider its population structure. In this context, this study aimed to characterise the genetic variability of T. sordida populations collected in areas with persistent infestations from Minas Gerais, Brazil. Levels of genetic variation and population structure were determined in peridomestic T. sordida by sequencing a polymorphic region of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Low nucleotide and haplotype diversity were observed for all 14 sampled areas; pi values ranged from 0.002-0.006. Most obtained haplotypes occurred at low frequencies, and some were exclusive to only one of the studied populations. Interpopulation genetic diversity analysis revealed strong genetic structuring. Furthermore, the genetic variability of Brazilian populations is small compared to that of Argentinean and Bolivian specimens. The possible factors related to the reduced genetic variability and strong genetic structuring obtained for studied populations are discussed in this paper.

AB  - Six to seven million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease transmitted mainly by triatomines. Triatoma bahiensis was recently collected in the Brazilian state of Bahia and revalidated using different approaches. The main criterion used to define a "good" biological species is reproductive isolation, so we evaluated the cytogenetics of first-generation (F1) hybrids resulting from the experimental cross between T. bahiensis females and Triatoma lenti males to possibly characterize the postzygotic isolation associated with the hybrid breakdown. All cells analyzed presented a karyotype of 2n = 22 and a pair of univalent autosomes. This chromosome behavior represents hybrid collapse and underscores the specific status of T. bahiensis. Thus, we have characterized the presence of the hybrid collapse phenomenon in an experimental cross, and we confirm the specific status of T. bahiensis, thus contributing to the Triatominae taxonomy.

AB  - Chagas disease remains highly prevalent in Chile, especially between the regions of Arica and Parinacota, and Coquimbo. Since 1999 it is considered that in Chile the vector transmission was interrupted. Under this premise, the epidemiological dynamics should be changing. We analyzed the evolution of the prevalence of Chagas' disease analyzing 64,995 xenodiagnosis performed in the laboratory of Parasitology of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Chile between 1949 and 2014. The evolution of the mortalities and incidences from the databases of the Ministry of Health in the periods in which it was analyzed. The rates of domiciliary infestation and the number of vector insects sent to the Public Health Institute and its trypano-triatomine indices were also analyzed. The prevalence of Chagas' disease in inhabitants of risk areas remained stable in this period as well as mortality. The incidence rate shows a progressive increase with a tendency towards stabilization. A significant decrease in sampling effort was found, declining by two orders of magnitude, especially since 2000. The progressive increase in morbidity had no clear relation to the interruption of the vector chain nor to the greater diagnostic effort occurred in 2009, since it was evident from before. While home infestation declines, reports of intrusion of solitary individuals and wild foci of T. infestans have increased. Trypano-triatomine indices were maintained with high values in all vector species. This study shows a worrying situation, for while on the one hand the interruption of the vector transmission and improvement in the research systems is emphasized, the concern for this disease seems to be decreasing with less diagnostic efforts and lower education at the higher level, and by the other hand the numbers show that the problem if it is not increasing, at least maintains its careless historical magnitude.

AB  - BACKGROUND: less access to appropriate care during pregnancy for immigrant/ethnic minority women can lead to worse health outcomes and higher costs for health services.
   OBJECTIVES: to conduct a systematic review of studies on the economic evaluation of maternal and child healthcare among immigrants and racial/ethnic minority groups in advanced economy countries.
   METHODS: the main biomedical/economic bibliographic databases and institutional sources were searched. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.
   RESULTS: encouraging breastfeeding and reducing inappropriate hospital use/length of hospital stay proved potentially able to reduce costs. Most studies showed a cost reduction if immigrant and ethnic minority women were included both in national and targeted programmes, such as nutritional programmes or case management. Screening campaigns targeting immigrants and ethnic minority groups were more cost-effective than broader, universal or non-screening strategies. Screenings were cost-effective when extended to newborns/relatives of pregnant women (Chagas disease) and were cost-effective for unvaccinated women in low-vaccination rates regions (rubella), immigrant women reporting no/uncertain vaccination history (varicella), and first-generation immigrants (HCV).
   DISCUSSION: promoting inclusion in pregnancy healthcare programmes or in targeted screening campaigns could be effective in cost saving for health services.

AB  - Introduction: The Housing Improvement Program for Chagas Disease Control (HIPCDC) was established in 2001 in Northwestern Rio Grande do Sul State, aiming to improve the conditions of the domiciliary and peridomiciliary environments to make them resistant to triatomine colonization. This study aimed to assess the impact of the HIPCDC on triatomine control by developing local population and authority awareness on the issue. Methods: The study was conducted by means of questionnaires applied to local authorities and the program beneficiaries. Three municipalities - Ajuricaba, Coronel Barros, and Crissiumal - were visited. Results: A program coordinator from each municipality and 62 individuals from selected households were interviewed. The authorities reported difficulties in the implementation of the program due to differences between the project development period and financial resource availability, in addition to a lack of understanding by the community not included in the program. As for the houses, most improvements were made in the peridomiciliary environments; moreover, construction of 4 new residences, as well as the renovation of others, was also reported. Regarding suggestions to the program, requests for better planning (44.9%) and renovation quality (36.7%) were highlighted. With reference to the presence of triatomine bugs, prior to the HIPCDC adaptations, 12.9% of the respondents reported coming across at least one specimen at home, as compared to 22.6% who found these insects in peridomiciliary areas. Conclusions: Despite reports of difficulties in carrying out the HIPCDC, there was an improvement in the housing conditions, with no triatomine occurrence reports after the program implementation.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi is a complex of phenotypically and genetically diverse isolates distributed in six discrete typing units (DTUs) designated as TcI-TcVI. Five years ago, T. cruzi isolates from Brazilian bats showing unique patterns of traditional ribosomal and spliced leader PCRs not clustering into any of the six DTUs were designated as the Tcbat genotype. In the present study, phylogenies inferred using SSU rRNA (small subunit of ribosomal rRNA), gGAPDH (glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and Cytb (cytochrome b) genes strongly supported Tcbat as a monophyletic lineage prevalent in Brazil, Panama and Colombia. Providing strong support for Tcbat, sequences from 37 of 47 nuclear and 12 mitochondria! genes (retrieved from a draft genome of Tcbat) and reference strains of all DTUs available in databanks corroborated Tcbat as an independent DTU. Consistent with previous studies, multilocus analysis of most nuclear genes corroborated the evolution of T. cruzi from bat trypanosomes its divergence into two main phylogenetic lineages: the basal TcII; and the lineage clustering TcIV, the clade comprising TcIII and the sister groups TcI-Tcbat. Most likely, the common ancestor of Tcbat and TcI was a bat trypanosome. However, the results of the present analysis did not support Tcbat as the ancestor of all DTUs. Despite the insights provided by reports of TcIII, TcIV and TcII in bats, including Amazonian bats harbouring TcII, further studies are necessary to understand the roles played by bats in the diversification of all DTUs. We also demonstrated that in addition to value as molecular markers for DTU assignment, Cytb, ITS rDNA and the spliced leader (SL) polymorphic sequences suggest spatially structured populations of Tcbat. Phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses, multiple molecular markers specific to Tcbat, and the degrees of sequence divergence between Tcbat and the accepted DTUs strongly support the definitive classification of Tcbat as a new DTU.

AB  - Introduction
   Chagas disease is one of the most important endemic parasitic diseases in Latin America. In its chronic phase, progression to cardiomyopathy has high morbidity and mortality. The persistence of a normal electrocardiogram (ECG) provides a similar prognosis to that of a non-diseased population. Benznidazole (BNZ) is the only drug with trypanocidal action available in Brazil.
   Materials/Methods/Results
   A group of 310 patients with chronic Chagas disease who had normal ECGs at the first medical visit performed before 2002 were included. There were 263 patients treated with BNZ and 47 untreated. The follow-up period was 19.59 years. Univariate analyses showed that those treated were younger and predominantly male. As many as 79.08% of those treated and 46.81% of those untreated continued with normal electrocardiograms (p < 0.0001). The occurrence of electrocardiographic abnormalities and relevant clinical events (heart failure, stroke, total mortality, and cardiovascular death) was less prevalent in treated patients (p < 0.001, p: 0.022, p: 0.047 respectively). In multivariate analyses, the parasiticide treatment was an independent variable for persistence of a normal ECG pattern, which was an independent variable in the prevention of significant clinical events. The immunofluorescence titers decreased with the parasitological treatment. However, the small number of tests in untreated patients did not allow the correlation of the decrease of these titers with electrocardiographic alterations.
   Conclusion
   These data suggest that treatment with benznidazole prevents the occurrence of electrocardiographic alterations. On the other hand, patients who develop ECG abnormalities present with more significant clinical events.

AB  - The female immigrant population is especially vulnerable to imported diseases. We describe the results of a prospective screening program for imported diseases performed in immigrant female patients. The protocol included tests for HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Treponema pallidum, Trypanosome cruzi, Strongyloides stercoralis and Schistosoma spp., intestinal parasites, malaria, and the detection of microfilaremia, according to the patient's origin. Six hundred eleven patients were studied. The most frequent imported diseases were intestinal parasitosis (39.4%), followed by syphilis (14.6%), HIV infection (9%), chronic HCV (5%), and HBV (3.3%). Most of the cases of HIV (78%) and HBV (85%) were diagnosed in patients aged between 16 and 45 years. Hepatitis C virus appeared mostly in patients in the 46- to 65-year range (P = 0.001; odds ratio [OD]: 3.667 [1.741-7.724]) or older than 65 years (P = 0.0001; OR: 26.350 [7.509-92.463]). Syphilis was diagnosed more frequently in patients older than 46 years (P = 0.0001; OR: 4.273 [2.649-6.893]). Multivariate analysis confirmed a greater presence of HCV infection (P = 0.049) and syphilis (P = 0.0001) in patients aged between 46 and 65 years. In 15.4% of patients, screening did not find any pathology. These data show a high prevalence of imported diseases in the female immigrant population, which may have serious consequences in terms of morbimortality and vertical transmission. Our results encourage the establishment of policies of active screening both in women of childbearing age and within the specific pregnancy screening programs.

AB  - Rhodnius Sal, 1859 is the second largest genus of Triatominae after Triatoma Laporte, 1832, and includes several important Chagas vectors. Genitalia in Reduviidae are frequently used for species identification, but the current use of terminology for it is inconsistent in Triatominae. Here, Rhodnius micki sp. nov., is described from Bolivia and considered as belonging to the pictipes group based on its morphological characters and distribution. Detailed documentation of the genitalia of Rhodnius micki sp. nov. is provided with emphasis on its everted phallus, especially the endosomal sclerites, which are potentially useful as species-level diagnostic features in Rhodnius. To further verify the validity of this species, the head shapes and wing venation patterns of five species in Rhodnius are compared with morphometric analysis. After reviewing taxonomic and comparative morphology papers of assassin bugs, a vocabulary with a terminology of morphological characters, especially of external male genitalic characters, is assembled with the preferred terms and the synonyms listed. Establishing a consistent terminological framework will greatly facilitate future research on the homology of these structures across Triatominae and will ultimately contribute to our understanding of the evolution of these groups.

AB  - Background Chagas disease (CD) continues to be a neglected infectious disease with one of the largest burdens globally. Despite the modest cure rates in adult chronic patients and its safety profile, benznidazole (BNZ) is still the drug of choice. Its current recommended dose is based on nonrandomized studies, and efficacy and safety of the optimal dose of BNZ have been scarcely analyzed in clinical trials. Methods/design MULTIBENZ is a phase II, randomized, noninferiority, double-blind, multicenter international clinical trial. A total of 240 patients with Trypanosoma CD in the chronic phase will be recruited in four different countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Spain). Patients will be randomized to receive BNZ 150 mg/day for 60 days, 400 mg/day for 15 days, or 300 mg/day for 60 days (comparator arm). The primary outcome is the efficacy of three different BNZ therapeutic schemes in terms of dose and duration. Efficacy will be assessed according to the proportion of patients with sustained parasitic load suppression in peripheral blood measured by polymerase chain reaction. The secondary outcomes are related to pharmacokinetics and drug tolerability. The follow-up will be 12 months from randomization to end of study participation. Recruitment was started in April 2018. Conclusion This is a clinical trial conducted for the assessment of different dose schemes of BNZ compared with the standard treatment regimen for the treatment of CD in the chronic phase. MULTIBENZ may help to clarify which is the most adequate BNZ regimen in terms of efficacy and safety, predicated on sustained parasitic load suppression in peripheral blood.

AB  - American trypanosomiasis or Chagas disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi affects many mammals, including humans and dogs, in all Latin American countries outside the Caribbean and increasingly also in the southern United States. Dogs are considered as reliable sentinels and have been identified as an important risk factor for the disease in humans in endemic countries. Factors that determine American trypanosomiasis in dogs may therefore have public health relevance. Associations of different environmental, locational, and pet owner socioeconomic conditions were evaluated retrospectively as potential risk factors for American trypanosomiasis status in dogs in a case-control study. Laboratory-confirmed cases received at the Texas A&M University Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital between the years 2000 and 2012 and candidate risk factor variables extracted from publicly available environmental data and 2010 US Census Bureau were used. The sample included 42 dogs serologically positive and 82 dogs serologically negative determined by indirect immunofluorescent assay. The diagnostic titer was 1:160 (case). Univariate logistic regressions followed by stepwise multivariate logistic modeling were used for variable screening and to determine the strengths of variable associations with case status. Total Edge Contrast Index (odds ratio [OR]=3.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.10, 3.62), residing in homes that had rural addresses (OR=2.48, 95% CI 2.43, 2.53), total number of owner occupied housing units in a neighborhood with a householder who is Hispanic or Latino (OR=1.66, 95% CI 1.04, 2.66), and the total number of housing units in a neighborhood that were built on or prior to year 1980 (OR=2.22, 95% CI 1.94, 2.55) were identified as risk factors. Suitable awareness campaigns and future research that considers pet owner housing and socioeconomic circumstances are necessary for effective prevention and control of this disease among dogs.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease vectors (Hemiptera-Reduviidae) comprise more than 140 blood-sucking insect species of the Triatominae subfamily. The largest genus is Triatoma, subdivided in several complexes and subcomplexes according to morphology, ecology and genetic features. One of them is the sordida subcomplex, involving four species: Triatoma sordida, T. guasayana, T. garciabesi and T. patagonica. Given the great morphological similarity of these species, their taxonomic identification, evolutionary relationships and population differentiation have been controversial for many years and even today remain under discussion.
   Methods: We simultaneously analyzed two chromosomal markers, C-heterochromatin distribution and 45S ribosomal genes chromosomal position, of 139 specimens from several sordida subcomplex populations from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Paraguay, collected both in nature and from several established insectaries. Our results were compared with COI sequences deposited in GenBank.
   Results: We recognized five chromosomal taxa with putative hybrids, which each differ in at least one chromosome marker. Most of them present significant differences in their mtDNA sequences.
   Conclusion: The chromosomal taxa here show a significant chromosome differentiation involving changes in the C-heterochromatin content and in the ribosomal clusters position. This paper identifies several erroneously classified populations by morphological methods, delimits the geographical distribution of each taxon and proposes the existence of a new cryptic species, widely distributed in Argentina. We also suggest that sordida sibling species involve closely related as well as evolutionary distant species. Taxonomic status of each chromosomal taxon is discussed considering phenotypic and genetic results previously published.

AB  - Triatoma nitida Usinger is a vector of the parasite Trypanosome cruzi (Chagas) that causes Chagas disease, with great capacity to adapt to areas with geographical and climatic differences, affecting human populations. Considering the current problem of reemerging diseases, the present study was done with the objectives of delimiting the current distribution of T. nitida in Latin America, identifying the environmental variables with the greatest influence on the distribution of the species for the future climate (2041-2060 and 2081-2100) under two climate change scenarios SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 (GtCO2), and to identify new invaded areas. A database with 55 geographic records was generated. Nineteen bioclimatic variables of the current period were downloaded with a resolution of 2.5 arc-min. For the future climate projection, the Beijing Climate Center-Climate System Model was considered for the years 2041-2060 and 2081-2100 under scenarios SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5. The model was calibrated by calculating the standardized coefficient of information from Akaike in R version 4.0.5 environment. The estimated area for Latin America was 2,089,284 km(2), 17 countries and 13 states of Mexico were identified with potential areas for the presence of the species. The estimated area for future climates presented with a decreasing trend from 205,515 km(2) for 2041-2060 and 857 km(2) for 2081-2100, being the largest distribution in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas in Mexico and the Central and South American countries Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Brazil. It can be noted that with this model the trend of decreasing the distribution area of T. nitida represents a lower epidemiological risk for the human population. Although the trend of the results show this decrease, new geographical areas of invasion were found which have ideal climatic characteristics for the establishment of the vector, which could contribute to its adaptation, increase its vectorial capacity, as well as expand the distribution of Chagas disease to new areas of Latin America; therefore, it is important to consider areas with high habitat suitability.

AB  - American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease, CD) affects circa 7 million persons worldwide. While of those persons present the asymptomatic, indeterminate chronic form (ICF), many will eventually progress to cardiac or digestive disorders. We studied a nonconcurrent (retrospective) cohort of patients attending an outpatient CD clinic in Southeastern Brazil, who were admitted while presenting the ICF in the period from 1998 through 2018 and followed until 2019. The outcomes of interest were the progression to cardiac or digestive CD forms. We were also interested in analyzing the impact of Benznidazole therapy on the progression of the disease. Extensive review of medical charts and laboratory files was conducted, collecting data up to year 2019. Demographics (upon inclusion), body mass index, comorbidities (including the Charlson index) and use of Benznidazole were recorded. The outcomes were defined by abnormalities in those test that could not be attributed to other causes. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariable Cox regression models. Among 379 subjects included in the study, 87 (22.9%) and 100 (26.4%) progressed to cardiac and digestive forms, respectively. In the final multivariable model, cardiac disorders were positively associated with previous coronary syndrome (Hazzard Ratio [HR], 2.42; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.53-3.81) and negatively associated with Benznidazole therapy (HR, 0.26; 95%CI, 0.11-0.60). On the other hand, female gender was the only independent predictor of progression to digestive forms (HR, 1.56; 95%CI, 1.03-2.38). Our results point to the impact of comorbidities on progression do cardiac CD, with possible benefit of the use of Benznidazole.
   Author summary Chagas Disease (CD) is a chronic, neglected infectious disease that affects several low-to-middle income countries. Besides its usual vector transmission, the etiological agent (Trypanosoma cruzi) can be transmitted through blood transfusion, so that migration from individuals with CD to Europe and North America. The scarcity and lack of evidence for therapeutic options is a major challenge for clinical approach of CD patients. Most of those patients are diagnosed while in asymptomatic, indeterminate chronic form (ICF). Our study aimed at identifying factors associated with progression from ICF to cardiac or digestive disorders. We studied a cohort of 379 IFC patients in inner Brazil, of which 87 and 100 developed cardiac and digestive disorders. In univariate and multivariable analyses, the use of Benznidazole (one of the few drugs used for CD therapy) was statistically protective for progression to cardiac, but not to digestive CD forms. These findings emphasize the importance of novel research aimed at developing more effective therapeutic options.

AB  - Background: Triatoma rubrofasciata is the only kissing bug species distributed globally. In the Americas, this species transmits the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, responsible for Chagas disease. The presence of T. rubrofasciata in several Asian countries has greatly increased recently. In Vietnam, it is found in large numbers, closely associated with human environments. Although T. rubrofasciata from Asia is not infected with Tryp. cruzi, it carries other parasites such as Trypanosoma lewisi and Trypanosoma conorhini. Reports of bites by T. rubrofasciata have increased significantly in several places of Vietnam, becoming a public health problem as it produces severe anaphylactic reactions.
   Methods: Specimens of T. rubrofasciata were collected from seven provinces in central Vietnam. We analyzed different biological attributes (life-cycle, starvation resistance, feeding and reproductive capacities) and genetic characteristics (chromosomes and DNA sequences) of T. rubrofasciata from Vietnam and compared them with Brazilian specimens. Natural infection with Tryp. conorhini and Tryp. lewisi were analyzed in a sample of 100 collected insects.
   Results: Species identification of T. rubrofasciata from central Vietnam was corroborated by genetic markers. Cytogenetic analyses showed that T. rubrofasciata from central Vietnam share the same chromosomal characteristics with individuals from Brazil and Hanoi. DNA sequence analyses of a mitochondrial cytochrome b gene fragment showed little variation between Old and New World specimens. Our study sample, compared with Brazilian individuals, showed a higher survival capacity revealed by a higher hatching rate (98% compared with 80.5%), a larger amount of blood taken in single meal and long-term starvation resistance. Furthermore, this species had a high natural rate of infection with Tryp. conorhini (46%) and Tryp. lewisi (27%).
   Conclusions: For T. rubrofasciata of Vietnam, a high rate of fecundity throughout the year, a high capacity for starvation, and its occurrence in synanthropic environments of urban areas with a high availability of food sources are risk factors to be taken into account by vector control campaigns. The several allergic reactions caused by their bites and their high infection with Tryp. lewisi highlight the need to implement specific control programmes for T. rubrofasciata in Vietnam.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   The role of trypanocidal therapy in patients with established Chagas' cardiomyopathy is unproven.
   METHODS
   We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized study involving 2854 patients with Chagas' cardiomyopathy who received benznidazole or placebo for up to 80 days and were followed for a mean of 5.4 years. The primary outcome in the time-to-event analysis was the first event of any of the components of the composite outcome of death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular tachycardia, insertion of a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, cardiac transplantation, new heart failure, stroke, or other thromboembolic event.
   RESULTS
   The primary outcome occurred in 394 patients (27.5%) in the benznidazole group and in 414 (29.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.07; P = 0.31). At baseline, a polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay was performed on blood samples obtained from 1896 patients; 60.5% had positive results for Trypanosoma cruzi on PCR. The rates of conversion to negative PCR results (PCR conversion) were 66.2% in the benznidazole group and 33.5% in the placebo group at the end of treatment, 55.4% and 35.3%, respectively, at 2 years, and 46.7% and 33.1%, respectively, at 5 years or more (P<0.001 for all comparisons). The effect of treatment on PCR conversion varied according to geographic region: in Brazil, the odds ratio for PCR conversion was 3.03 (95% CI, 2.12 to 4.34) at 2 years and 1.87 (95% CI, 1.33 to 2.63) at 5 or more years; in Colombia and El Salvador, the odds ratio was 1.33 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.98) at 2 years and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.45) at 5 or more years; and in Argentina and Bolivia, the odds ratio was 2.63 (95% CI, 1.89 to 3.66) at 2 years and 2.79 (95% CI, 1.99 to 3.92) at 5 or more years (P<0.001 for interaction). However, the rates of PCR conversion did not correspond to effects on clinical outcome (P = 0.16 for interaction).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Trypanocidal therapy with benznidazole in patients with established Chagas' cardiomyopathy significantly reduced serum parasite detection but did not significantly reduce cardiac clinical deterioration through 5 years of follow-up.

AB  - The wild species Rhodnius brethesi (Matta, 1919) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) is found in areas of piassabais in microregion of Rio Negro, Amazonas, Brazil. Its geographical distribution overlaps the areas of Leopoldinia piassaba palm. In areas where palm trees are found, transmission cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi is related to the extractive activity of the palm fiber, exposing workers to wild vector transmission of this parasite. The close association with the palm tree L. piassaba suggests that this wild triatomine has special features in its sensory system allowing specificity of ecotope. The objective of the study is to identify the antennal sensilla phenotype and morphologically characterize the size and shape of the wings of wild R. brethesi, and to compare with the phenotype present in individuals reared in the laboratory. From the samples taken in the field, the presence of the species R. brethesi was found on both banks of the Rio Negro. The techniques used to verify the morphological patterns are important resources for observations of the triatomine populations, be they in an artificial or natural habitat.

AB  - Background and objectives: This study provides a longitudinal scientometric analysis of global trypanosomiasis research between 1988 and 2017 as indexed in Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science (WoS). Contributions by researchers from different countries and continents are outlined based on publication productivity, international collaborations, citation analysis, and keyword analysis.
   Methods: Bibliographic records of research publications indexed by WoS were downloaded based on a broad search of related terms. The authors compared the growth of literature by continent using 5 year increments, conducted a citation and co-authorship analysis by country, and a keyword analysis by publication using the scientometric visualization software VOSviewer.
   Results: The trypanosomiasis research literature has seen more than a fourfold annual increase in production over the study period. Contributions by authors affiliated with European and South American countries proportionately account for the most research literature. The United States and Brazil, however, occupy central roles for citations and as national contributors to the literature. The terms 'trypanosomiasis cruzi' and 'chagas disease' have become more prominent, reflecting the regional growth of research from South America.
   Interpretation and conclusion: Relative contributions from regions where the disease is prevalent show mixed developments. Contributions by African authors have declined proportionately to other areas of the world. However, South American contributions have increased during the study period. The contributing countries to the literature do not necessarily represent regions in which the diseases are prevalent. The same is true of the citation relationships, where European and North American contributions are more frequently cited. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: In the past two decades, a new epidemiological profile of Chagas' disease (CD) has been registered in the Brazilian Amazon where oral transmission has been indicated as responsible for the increase of acute cases. In the Amazonas state, five outbreaks of acute CD have been registered since 2004. The cardiac manifestations in these cases may be characterized by diffuse myocarditis, with alteration in the electrocardiogram (ECG) and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).
   Objective: To perform a cardiac evaluation in autochthonous patients in the acute phase and at least one year after submitted to treatment for acute CD and evaluate the demographic variables associated with the presence of cardiac alterations.
   Methods: We evaluated patients diagnosed with acute CD through direct parasitological or serological (IgM) methods from 2007 to 2015. These patients were treated with benznidazole and underwent ECG and TTE before and after treatment. We assumed a confidence interval of 95% (CI 95%, p < 0.05) for all variables analyzed.
   Results: We observed 63 cases of an acute CD in which oral transmission corresponded to 75%. Cardiac alterations were found in 33% of the cases, with a greater frequency of ventricular repolarization alteration (13%), followed by pericardial effusion (10%) and right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block (2%). The follow-up occurred in 48 patients with ECG and 25 with TTE for a mean period of 15.5 +/- 4.1 months after treatment. Of these, 8% presented normalization of the cardiac alterations in ECG, 62.5% remained with the normal exams. All of the patients presented normal results in TTE in the post-treatment period. As for the demographic variables, isolated cases presented more cardiac alterations than outbreaks (p = 0.044) as well as cases from Central Amazonas mesoregion (p = 0.020).
   Conclusions: Although cardiac alterations have not been frequent in most of the studied population, a continuous evaluation of the clinical-epidemiological dynamics of the disease in the region is necessary in order to establish preventive measures.

AB  - We conducted a lab-based comparative study on vector capacity features of two species of triatomines: Triatoma brasiliensis and T. melanica. Both are members of the T. brasiliensis species complex. The former is the most important Chagas disease vector in the northeastern region of Brazil. To date, no transmission via T. melanica has been recorded. Immature insects exhibited distinct intermoult periods without a direct relationship to a given species. Females of T. brasiliensis consumed an average of 1.9 times more meals (mean = 12.92 vs 6.63) and survived for a shorter period (mean = 330.8 days) than T. melanica (mean = 365.2 days), probably due to the cost of reproduction (all significant at P<0.05). These data support the idea that T. brasiliensis is more adapted to lab conditions and is more able to infest domiciles than T. melanica. We also found significant distinctions in other features between these species, such as the elapsed time without eating before molting, which was higher for the second, third, and fifth nymph stages of T. melanica. Regarding features analyzed related to vector capacity, insects of all life stages of both species were considered competent to transmit Trypanosoma cruzi because they needed many feedings (mean = 1.5-3.82) to moult and because a high proportion (>39%) of insects defecated rapidly (<30 s) after feeding. Overall, results highlight the need to extend vector surveillance to T. melanica.

AB  - Trypanosoma spp. infection is a problem in many tropical countries, infecting several animal species, including humans. The aim of the present study was to identify the Trypanosoma species in Neotropical primates from Rio de Janeiro state and compare the results with other reports both phylogenetically and geographically. Molecular detection was based on the 18 SSU gene. The sequences obtained in the PCR were sequenced and compared with others previously deposited in GenBank. These sequences were used to perform phylogenetic analysis and make a distribution map of primate species infected by Trypanosoma species in Brazil. Among 34 monkeys, five capuchin monkeys (Sapajus spp.) and one marmoset (Callithrix spp.) showed Trypanosoma spp. sequences in the same clade of Trypanosoma minasense and three capuchin monkeys??? sequences were in the same clade of Trypanosoma cruzi. The Atlantic Forest and the Brazilian Amazon are the regions with the highest frequency of studies about Trypanosoma spp. and variety of Neotropical primate hosts. These are areas that deserve attention regarding the conservation of biodiversity, but it also makes evident the lack of studies with Neotropical primates in other regions of the country, as well as multidisciplinary studies to better understand the host pathogen relationships.

AB  - Objectives. Prenatal care is a pillar of public health, enabling access to interventions including prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and congenital syphilis. This paper describes social factors related to use of prenatal care in Ecuador.
   Methods. In 2011 and 2012, participant clinical history and interview information was analyzed from a national probability sample of 5 998 women presenting for delivery or miscarriage services in 15 healthcare facilities in Ecuador, to estimate prevalence of HIV, syphilis, and Chagas disease, and prenatal care coverage.
   Results. The study found that 94.1% of women had attended at least one prenatal visit, but that attendance at no less than four visits was 73.1%. Furthermore, lower educational level, greater number of pregnancies, occupation in the agriculture or livestock sector, and membership in ethnic indigenous, Afro-Ecuadorian, or other minority groups were factors associated with lack of use (no prenatal visits) or insufficient use of prenatal care (fewer than four visits or first visit at > 20 weeks gestation) in Ecuador.
   Conclusions. These results point to persistence of marked inequalities in access to and use of prenatal health services attributable to socioeconomic factors and to the need to strengthen strategies to address them, to reach the goal of universal prenatal care coverage.

AB  - Background: Triatomine bugs transmit Chagas disease across Latin America, where vector control-surveillance is increasingly decentralized. Locally run systems often deal with highly diverse native-vector faunas-plus, in some areas, domestic populations of non-native species. Flexible entomological-risk indicators that cover native and non-native vectors and can support local decision-making are therefore needed.
   Methods: We present a local-scale entomological-risk score ("TriatoScore") that leverages and builds upon information on the ecology-behavior and distribution-biogeography of individual triatomine bug species. We illustrate our approach by calculating TriatoScores for the 417 municipalities of Bahia state, Brazil. For this, we (i) listed all triatomine bug species recorded statewide; (ii) derived a "species relevance score" reflecting whether each species is native/non-native and, if native, whether/how often it invades/colonizes dwellings; (iii) mapped each species' presence by municipality; (iv) for native vectors, weighted presence by the proportion of municipal territory within ecoregions occupied by each species; (v) multiplied "species relevance score" x "weighted presence" to get species-specific "weighted scores"; and (vi) summed "weighted scores" across species to get municipal TriatoScores. Using standardized TriatoScores, we then grouped municipalities into high/moderate/low entomological-risk strata.
   Results: TriatoScores were higher in municipalities dominated by dry-to-semiarid ecoregions than in those dominated by savanna-grassland or, especially, moist-forest ecoregions. Bahia's native triatomines can maintain high to moderate risk of vector-borne Chagas disease in 318 (76.3%) municipalities. Historical elimination of Triatoma infestans from 125 municipalities reduced TriatoScores by similar to 27% (range, 20-44%); eight municipalities reported T. infestans since Bahia was certified free of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission by this non-native species. Entomological-risk strata based on TriatoScores agreed well with Bahia's official disease-risk strata, but TriatoScores suggest that the official classification likely underestimates risk in 42 municipalities. Of 152 municipalities failing to report triatomines in 2006-2019, two and 71 had TriatoScores corresponding to, respectively, high and moderate entomological risk.
   Conclusions: TriatoScore can help control-surveillance managers to flexibly assess and stratify the entomological risk of Chagas disease at operationally relevant scales. Integrating eco-epidemiological, demographic, socioeconomic, or operational data (on, e.g., local-scale dwelling-infestation or vector-infection frequencies, land-use change and urbanization, housing conditions, poverty, or the functioning of control-surveillance systems) is also straightforward. TriatoScore may thus become a useful addition to the triatomine bug control-surveillance toolbox.

AB  - The state of Rondo<SIC>nia in the Brazilian Amazon is prone to diseases transmitted by insect vectors because of the environmental and population changes resulting from large hydroelectric projects and the expansion of agricultural and livestock industries. The first case of Chagas disease by vectorial transmission was recorded in 2019 in a rural area in Rondo<SIC>nia, reinforcing the need for entomological surveillance. Hence, our goal was to estimate the abundance of Rhodnius spp. in palm trees located in rural and periurban areas and in Brazil-Bolivia border regions, perform domiciliary searches, and check for possible associations between triatomines and the presence/ absence of palm-inhabiting fauna and outdoor farming, domestic animals, and buildings. The sampling took place in five municipalities of Rondo<SIC>nia in 2014 (June to August) and 2015 (April to June). Triatomines were collected by active searches during the selective pruning of palm tree crowns. Domiciliary inspections lasted from 30 to 60 min. A set of captured triatomines was analyzed for Trypanosoma cruzi and T. rangeli infection by PCR. Overall, 496 insects were captured during sampling of 150 palms in rural areas and 150 in periurban areas. No triatomine was found during active searches of 59 dwelling either indoors or outdoors. The majority of triatomines caught in the palm trees were identified as Rhodnius robustus (98.6%), and seven specimens were R. pictipes. Triatomine infestation was observed in only 20% of the sampled palms (61/300) in the vicinity of 26/ 59 households. Nearly half of the infested palm trees had only one or two triatomines, and few palms presented more than 15 triatomines. The municipality of Buritis had the highest triatomine abundance and percentage of infested palms; however, the highest triatomine density per infested palm was observed in Alvorada D'Oeste, where a quarter of the palms were infested. Ants, arachnids, termites, reptiles, and rodents were frequently found in palm trees. Dogs were the predominant domestic animals in households, whereas hens and cattle were the main farming animals. Model estimates showed that the number of triatomines was affected by the presence of henhouses and varied strongly between localities. No relationships were detected between the average number of triatomines and palm fauna and/or palm height. Overall, approximately half of the triatomines were infected with T. cruzi (51.4%) and/or T. rangeli (47.2%), reinforcing the need for continuous entomological surveillance and implementation of community-based approaches because the Brazilian state of Rondo<SIC>nia borders areas experiencing reinfestation by domiciled species and potential colonization of animal shelters by triatomines.

AB  - The Rhodniini tribe is one of the five tribes in the subfamily Triatominae and is notorious for its domestic blood-sucking pests and vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi across Latin America. The human and economic costs of the Chagas disease in the American tropics are considerable, and these insects are of unquestionable importance to humans. We used mitochondrial rDNA (16S), nuclear ribosomal RNA (28S) and wingless (Wg) sequences to perform phylogenetic analysis to derive trees based on parsimony and maximum likelihood. Nucleotide sequences were used in molecular-clock analyses to estimate time divergence between species of Rhodniini. The potential distribution of each species was modeled and compared with Kappa statistic. Multivariate niches with bioclimatic variables were used to describe differences between the species using discriminant analysis. The results of this study indicate that the Rhodniini originated 17.91 Mya ago. Rhodnius domesticus is the oldest species having its origin at 9.13 Mya. Rhodniini are closely related to Salyavatinae that are specialist termite predators and diverged from this subfamily 30.43 Mya. Most species are clearly allopatric and have distinct bioclimatic niches. The colonization of bromeliads, palms trees and bird nests represent important events for the speciation of these taxa. The hematophagous habit can be described as a scenario where Rhodniini's ancestor could be pre-adapted for the invasion of bromeliads, palm trees, and bird nests where they would find significant water availability and thermal damping. These environments are widely used by vertebrate inquilines that would be the source of food for the species of Rhodniini. Lastly, our results show an alternative position of Psammolestes in the phylogenetic tree.

AB  - Context: 'Carnauba' wax is a natural product obtained from the processing of the powder exuded from Copernicia prunifera (Miller) H. E. Moore (Arecaceae). This material is widely used in the Brazilian folk medicine, including the treatment of rheumatism and syphilis.
   Objective: To investigate the antiprotozoal activity of hexane and EtOH extracts from the 'carnauba' wax as well as from the isolated compounds from the bioactive extracts.
   Material and methods: Two different samples of 'carnauba' (C. prunifera) waxes-types 1 and 4-were individually extracted using hexane (EH) and EtOH (EE). Aliquots of hexane (type 1-EH-1 and EH-4) and EtOH (type 4-EE-1 and EE-4) extracts were tested against promastigote (2-200 mu g/mL in DMSO during 48 h at 24 degrees C) and amastigote (3-150 mu g/mL in DMSO during 120 h at 37 degrees C) forms of Leishmania infantum as well as against trypomastigote (3-150 mu g/mL in DMSO during 24 h at 37 degrees C) forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Bioactive extracts EH-1 and EE-4 were subjected to a bioactivity-guided fractionation to afford three dammarane-type triterpenoids (1-3). The in vitro antiprotozoal activities of the obtained compounds were evaluated as described above. Additionally, the cytotoxicity activity of compounds 1-3 against mammalian conjunctive cells (NCTC-2-200 mu g/mL in DMSO during 48 h at 37 degrees C) was determined.
   Results: From the bioactive hexane and EtOH extracts from the 'carnauba' (C. prunifera) wax, were isolated three dammarane-type triterpenoids: (24R*)-methyldammar-25-ene-3 beta, 20-diol (carnaubadiol, 1), (24R*)-methyldammara-20,25-dien-3-one (2) and (24R*)-methyldammara-20,25-dien-3 alpha-ol (3). These compounds were identified based on the analysis of NMR and MS spectroscopic data. Compounds 1-3 were effective against the intracellular amastigotes of L. infantum, with IC50 values ranging from 8 to 52 mu M, while compounds 1 and 3 displayed activity against trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi with IC50 values of 15 and 35 mu M, respectively. The mammalian cytotoxicity assay demonstrated no damage to NCTC conjunctive cells up to 200 mu M, except for compound 1, which demonstrated a CC50 value of 34 mu M.
   Conclusion: Based on the results, it was possible to conclude that the detected antiprotozoal bioactivity of 'carnauba' (C. prunifera) wax extracts could be related to the presence of the natural dammarane triterpenoid derivatives. The results suggested that these compounds could be used as promising scaffolds for drug design studies for leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.

AB  - Bats are well-known hosts of trypanosomatids, though information about their role as reservoirs of these protozoans in the Brazilian savanna is poorly known. We aimed to analyze the occurrence of trypanosomatid species in bats occurring in remnants of gallery forests of Brasilia, Federal District of Brazil. We sampled bats using mist nets in six sites, and we collected blood, wing fragments and oral swab samples from all captured individuals. Trypanosomatids were identified in the captured bats through sequencing of the SSUrRNA region and kDNA qPCR. We found no parasite in blood smears of 146 individuals of 14 species captured, but blood cultures were positive for nine bats. We detected trypanosomatids molecularly in 111 (76%) specimens of all bat species in the studied areas. Most of the infected bats had Leishmania-like DNA detected in blood and swab samples of the oral mucosa. We distinguished three species of Trypanosoma (Trypanosoma dionisii, T. rangeli and T. cruzi) in Corolla perspicillata. SSUrRNA PCR of oral samples is a non-invasive and practical method for identification of trypanosomatid specie's in bats. Our results support our belief that bats could be potential reservoirs for Trypanosoma and Leishmania-like species in the enzootic cycle of these parasites in gallery forests of the Brazilian Cerrado biome.

TI  - In Search of Congenital Chagas Disease in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
LA  - English
AB  - Chagas disease remains a major impediment to sustainable socioeconomic development in Latin America. Transplacental transmission explains the persistence of transmission in urban areas, in non-endemic regions, and in areas with an established interrupted vectorial transmission. One of every five cases of congenital Chagas disease in the world occurs in Colombia and Venezuela. The massive migration of impoverished populations from neighboring Venezuela has worsened the situation creating a humanitarian crisis in Northeastern Colombia, including the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The prevalence of Chagas infection among pregnant women in these areas is higher than the national average, and the public health resources are insufficient. This perspective discusses the associated increased morbidity and mortality of congenital Chagas in this region, where stigmatization contributes to the impression among health authorities and the general population that it affects indigenous communities only. The monitoring and control of congenital Chagas disease in the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta is a public health necessity that demands urgent and effective interventions.

AB  - Aim: Chagas disease is a serious public health problem, endemic in 21 countries in Latin America. A future vaccine can contribute to decreasing the number of cases and its complications. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with residents of the northern region of Brazil, on the willingness to pay for a hypothetical vaccine against Chagas disease (effective protection of 80%). Results: We interviewed 619 individuals and seven were excluded from the analysis and the value of willingness to pay was US$23.77 (100.00 BRL). Conclusion: The Northern region of Brazil is one of the largest markets for this vaccine, due to its epidemiological relevance, so economic studies with this vaccine will be important to assist in the assessment of technologies.

AB  - Reports of triatomine infestation in urban areas have increased. We analysed the spatial distribution of infestation by triatomines in the urban area of Diamantina, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Triatomines were obtained by community-based entomological surveillance. Spatial patterns of infestation were analysed by Ripley's K function and Kernel density estimator. Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land cover derived from satellite imagery were compared between infested and uninfested areas. A total of 140 adults of four species were captured (100 Triatoma vitticeps, 25 Panstrongylus geniculatus, 8 Panstrongylus megistus, and 7 Triatoma arthurneivai specimens). In total, 87.9% were captured within domiciles. Infection by trypanosomes was observed in 19.6% of 107 examined insects. The spatial distributions of T. vitticeps, P. geniculatus, T. arthurneivai, and trypanosome-positive triatomines were clustered, occurring mainly in peripheral areas. NDVI values were statistically higher in areas infested by T. vitticeps and P. geniculatus. Buildings infested by these species were located closer to open fields, whereas infestations of P. megistus and T. arthurneivai were closer to bare soil. Human occupation and modification of natural areas may be involved in triatomine invasion, exposing the population to these vectors.

AB  - ProblemTrypanosoma cruzi and Toxoplasma gondii present, respectively, low and high congenital transmission rates. The placenta as an immune regulatory organ expresses TLRs, leading to the secretion of cytokines. Both parasites are recognized by TLR-2, TLR-4, and TLR-9. Here, we studied if the parasites induce differences in TLR protein expression, cytokine profiles, and whether receptor inhibition is related to parasite infection.
   Method of studyPlacental tissue explants were infected ex vivo with each parasite, TLRs protein expression, cytokine profile and parasite infection were determined by Western blotting, ELISA and qPCR.
   ResultsTrypanosoma cruzi and Toxoplasma gondii infection is related to TLR-2 and TLR-4/TLR-9, respectively. Trypanosoma cruzi elicits an increase in TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 cytokine secretion whereas T.gondii only increases the secretion of IL-8.
   ConclusionThe susceptibility of the placenta to each parasite is mediated partially by the innate immune response.

AB  - Chagas disease continues to be an important cause of morbidity, mortality and disability in several Latin American countries, including Brazil. Using findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD, 2016), we present years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life years due to Chagas disease in Brazil, by sex, age group, and Brazilian states, from 1990 to 2016. Results are reported in absolute numbers and age-standardized rates (per 100,000 population) with 95% uncertainty intervals. In 2016, 141,640 disability-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty intervals: 129,065-155,941) due to Chagas disease were estimated in Brazil, with a relative reduction of 36.7% compared with 1990 (223,879 disability-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty intervals: 209,372-238,591)). Age-standardized disability-adjusted life year rates declined at the national level (-69.7%) and in all Brazilian states between 1990 and 2016, but with different regional patterns. The decrease in the disability-adjusted life year rates was driven primarily by a consistent reduction in the years of life lost rates, the main component of total disability-adjusted life years for Chagas disease. The highest fatal and non-fatal burden due to Chagas disease was observed among males, the elderly, and in those Brazilian states encompassing important endemic areas for vector transmission in the past. Despite the consistent reduction in its burden during the period, Chagas disease is still an important and neglected cause of health lost due to premature mortality and disability in Brazil. Efforts should be made to maintain the political interest and sustainability of surveillance and control actions for Chagas disease, prevent the risk of re-emergence of vector transmission in endemic areas, and provide health care to chronically infected individuals, including early diagnosis and treatment interventions.

AB  - A brief overview of the evolution of knowledge about Chagas disease since its discovery by Carlos Chagas in 1909 until the mid-1940s is presented. The trajectory of physician Pedreira de Freitas and his growing involvement in research in the area led to his contributions to laboratory diagnosis - which lent consistency and security to epidemiological surveys of Chagas disease - and the redefinition of the scale of the disease in Brazil and the Americas with its terrible social and economic impact. His proposal for the disease prevention model - based on selective purging in the application of insecticide - was adopted nationally and internationally and made it possible to bring the disease under control in Brazil and other countries. He devoted himself with equal intensity to enhancing the teaching of medical practices in the community and was a pioneer in the implementation of preventive medicine in medical education in Brazil.

AB  - BACKGROUND Didelphis spp. are a South American marsupial species that are among the most ancient hosts for the Trypanosoma spp.
   OBJECTIVES We characterise a new species (Trypanosoma janseni n. sp.) isolated from the spleen and liver tissues of Didelphis aurita in the Atlantic Rainforest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   METHODS The parasites were isolated and a growth curve was performed in NNN and Schneider's media containing 10% foetal bovine serum. Parasite morphology was evaluated via light microscopy on Giemsa-stained culture smears, as well as scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Molecular taxonomy was based on a partial region (737-bp) of the small subunit (18S) ribosomal RNA gene and 708 bp of the nuclear marker, glycosomal glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) genes. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods were used to perform a species coalescent analysis and to generate individual and concatenated gene trees. Divergence times among species that belong to the T. cruzi clade were also inferred.
   FINDINGS In vitro growth curves demonstrated a very short log phase, achieving a maximum growth rate at day 3 followed by a sharp decline. Only epimastigote forms were observed under light and scanning microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy analysis showed structures typical to Trypanosoma spp., except one structure that presented as single-membraned, usually grouped in stacks of three or four. Phylogeography analyses confirmed the distinct species status of T. janseni n. sp. within the T. cruzi clade. Trypanosoma janseni n. sp. clusters with T. wauwau in a well-supported clade, which is exclusive and monophyletic. The separation of the South American T. wauwau + T. janseni coincides with the separation of the Southern Super Continent.
   CONCLUSIONS This clade is a sister group of the trypanosomes found in Australian marsupials and its discovery sheds light on the initial diversification process based on what we currently know about the T. cruzi clade.

AB  - Chagas disease is among the 21 neglected diseases according to the World Health Organization. This study aimed to investigate the morbidity and mortality distribution of Chagas disease for identifying areas with greater prevalences and deaths of the disease in Northeast Brazil. A population-based ecological study was performed from 2016 to 2018 using data on acute Chagas disease patients from the Disease Notification Information System, chronic cases from the Chagas Disease and the referral Heart Failure Outpatient Clinic in Pernambuco, and Chagas disease-related mortality from the Mortality Information System. The unit of analysis were Pernambuco State mesoregions. The indicators were spatialized into thematic maps on the occurrence and mortality of the disease per 100,000 inhabitants. No cases of acute disease were reported in the period analyzed. Data on 801 chronic Chagas disease patients were analyzed. The population showed an average age of 62 years, with female predominance. The most prevalent comorbidity was systemic arterial hypertension and cardiologic involvement without ventricular dysfunction. The average chronic disease occurrence rate was 3.2/ 100,000 people/ year. As for deaths in the mortality system; in total, 350 deaths were recorded, showing male predominance, age >= 60 years, and chronic disease with cardiac involvement as the main mortality cause. The annual average mortality proportion was 1.6/100,000 people. The chronic case distribution showed spatial heterogeneity, with the highest rates of chronic disease and deaths observed in two mesoregions, with the main cause of death being heart-related. This highlights the need for more specialized services in areas with higher burden of the disease to avoid delay in the patients' care.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first officially described in Brazil on February 26th, 2020. The accumulation of reports of concomitant infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and pathogens that cause diseases endemic to tropical countries, such as dengue and chikungunya fever, has started to draw attention. Chagas disease and leprosy remain public health problems in many developing countries, such as Brazil. In this manuscript, we describe a case of concomitant leprosy, Chagas disease, and COVID-19, highlighting the cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the clinical behavior of household contacts who previously received prophylactic Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccines.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease in Chile has increased in research, especially in pregnant women and donors in general, but remains neglected in Latin America. The environmental epidemiology of the vector points out the Coquimbo region is a greatest risk area. Aim: To analyze the time series of mortality and incidence rate Chagas disease national; regional and communal according to age. Method: Population-based study, time series of mortality (1997 to 2017) and incidence rate (2011 to 2017), country, region and 15 communes. Use of gross and adjusted rates, calculating ch2, T test, ANOVA, p value < 0.05. Results: Mortality; 49.37% (668) of the National deaths (1353) were Coquimbo region's residents, mainly male patients and over 60 years old people with cardiac and digestive complications, residents from Salamanca, Combarbala and Illapel. Incidence: Of 6.173 accumulated cases, 6% are under 20 years old, higher incidence of women (61.4%) with an average age of 50 years old versus 56 years old men (T test = 29.19 p-value = 0.000), residents from Ovalle, Andacollo, Monte Patria and Illapel. Conclusions: Half of Chagas' disease deaths reside in the Coquimbo region, new cases, under 20 years old, are 6%.

AB  - Introduction: This study describes the occurrence of trypanosomatids in phlebotomines in Brasilia, Brazil. Methods: Two hundred and ten females of 13 sand fly species were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using different molecular markers (D7 24S alpha rRNA, kDNA, and ITS1) and sequencing. Results: PCR revealed trypanosomatid-positive samples from Nyssomyia whitmani and Evandromyia evandroi, which were negative by kDNA and ITS1 Leishmania-specific PCRs. DNA sequence analysis of D7 24Sa rRNA amplicons indicated the occurrence of Blastocrithidia sp. and Trypanosoma sp. in Nyssomyia whitmani and Evandromyia evandroi, respectively. Conclusions: Two trypanosomatid species other than Leishmania sp. were found to circulate in sand flies in Central Brazil.

AB  - Studies on the effects of azadirachtin treatment, ecdysone supplementation and ecdysone therapy on both the ultrastructural organization of the rectum in 5th-instar nymph of Rhodnius prolixus and the ex vivo attachment behavior of Trypanosoma cruzi under these experimental conditions were carried out. Control insects had a typical and significant organization of the rectum cuticle consisted of four main layers (procuticle, inner epicuticle, outer epicuticle, and wax layer) during the entire period of the experiment. Both azadirachtin treatment and ecdysone supplementation avoid the development of both outer epicuticle and wax layer. Oral therapy with ecdysone partially reversed the altered organization and induce the development of the four main rectal cuticle layers. In the same way, the ex vivo attachment of T. cruzi to rectal cuticle was blocked by azadirachtin treatment but ecdysone therapy also partially recovered the parasite adhesion rates to almost those detected in control insects. These results point out that ecdysone may be a factor responsible - directly or indirectly - by the modulation of rectum ultrastructural arrangement providing a superficial wax layer to the attachment followed by metacyclogenesis of T. cruzi in the rectum of its invertebrate hosts.

AB  - Despite the decline in prevalence of Chagas disease in Brazil, the Northeast region of the country has favorable conditions for its resurgence. The study aimed to analyze positive Chagas disease serology rates among blood donors in Piaui State from 2004 to 2013. Prevalence of positive Chagas disease serology in blood donor screening was 1%, ranging from 0.4% in the Urucui Regional Health District to 2.4% in the Sao Raimundo Nonato Regional Health District. Of the state's 220 municipalities, 58.6% reported cases. Only 34.5% of the positive samples in screening were referred for complementary tests, and 84.4% of these showed negative results. Our findings suggest the possibility of persistent vector-borne transmission in areas of Piaui State and the need for measures to improve complementary testing in positive cases detected by screening.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an endemic parasitic disease frequently found in Northeast Brazil and may cause acute kidney injury (AKI) and glomerulonephritis. After appropriate treatment, renal function recovery may occur. We describe the rare case of a patient with VL, who developed severe AKI requiring dialysis and was subsequently diagnosed with Chagas disease coinfection. After specific treatment for VL, there was partial recovery of the renal function, followed by the onset of Chagas disease cardiomyopathy.

AB  - People with Chagas disease are at a higher risk of death due to cardiac arrest (CA). Considering that Chagas disease remains a serious health problem in Latin America, studies in this regard are still needed. The aim of this study was to present 2 patients with Chagas that developed CA and were treated at the emergency department of a reference hospital in Brazil (Sao Paulo city). Case one: Male (73 years old and Caucasian) with a history of systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, and Chagas disease associated with megacolon and megaesophagus. After cardiac collapse and 30 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), unfortunately the patient died. Case two: A female patient (64 years old and Caucasian), with a history of systemic arterial hypertension, obesity, and Chagas disease. After 23 days of hospitalization, pharmacological therapy, and implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator, the patient was discharged. People with Chagas disease are at a higher risk of CA. The researchers believe that a prompt and efficient treatment (advanced life support) allied with educational programs on CA recognition targeted at health professionals and caregivers (basic life support knowledge) could improve the prognoses of these patients.

AB  - Background
   Individuals in the indeterminate phase of Chagas disease are considered to have mortality rates similar to those of the overall population. This study compares mortality rates among blood donors seropositive for Chagas disease and negative controls in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   Methodology/principal findings
   This is a retrospective cohort study of blood donors from 1996 to 2000: 2842 seropositive and 5684 seronegative for Chagas disease. Death status was ascertained by performing probabilistic record linkage (RL) with the Brazil national mortality information system (SIM). RL was assessed in a previous validation study. Cox Regression was used to derive hazard ratios (HR), adjusting for confounders. RL identified 159 deaths among the 2842 seropositive blood donors (5.6%) and 103 deaths among the 5684 seronegative (1.8%). Out of the 159 deaths among seropositive donors, 26 had the 10th International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) indicating Chagas disease as the underlying cause of death (B57.0/B57.5), 23 had ICD-10 codes (I42.0/I42.2/I47.0/I47.2/I49.0/I50.0/I50.1/I50.9/I51.7) indicating cardiac abnormalities possibly related to Chagas disease listed as an underlying or associated cause of death, with the others having no mention of Chagas disease in part I of the death certificate. Donors seropositive for Chagas disease had a 2.3 times higher risk of death due to all causes (95% Confidence Interval (95% CI), 1.8-3.0) than seronegative donors. When considering deaths due to Chagas disease or those that had underlying causes of cardiac abnormalities related to Chagas disease, seropositive donors had a risk of death 17.9 (95% CI, 6.3-50.8) times greater than seronegative donors.
   Conclusions/significance
   There is an excess risk of death in donors seropositive blood for Chagas disease compared to seronegative donors. Chagas disease is an under-reported cause of death in the Brazilian mortality database.

AB  - Neighborhood dogs may act as reservoirs for several zoonotic protozoan infections, particularly in urban areas, thus constituting a potential public health threat. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the exposure of neighborhood dogs to four protozoan pathogens in public areas with high levels of human movement in Curitiba, southern Brazil. Blood samples from 26 neighborhood dogs were screened by means of the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) for Leishmania spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi and Neospora caninum, and a questionnaire was answered by the respective keeper. A total of 8/26 dogs (30.7%) seroreactive to T. gondii, 3/26 (11.5%) to N. caninum and 2/26 (7.7%) to both were identified. All the samples were seronegative for T. cruzi and Leishmania spp. Pathogen seroreactivity was not associated with the daily human movements or other epidemiological variables investigated (p > 0.05). In conclusion, the low seroprevalence for T. gondii and N. caninum indicated low environmental and food risk for animal infection and the seronegativity for Leishmania spp. and T. cruzi may reflect the absence of these pathogens in urban areas of Curitiba. Moreover, neighborhood dogs may be used as environmental sentinels for the presence of protozoan pathogens and their vectors.

AB  - In this study, the karyometry of different Triatoma infestans populations from different states of Brazil was analyzed and compared with those of a population from Cochabamba. No significant differences were found between the population from Cochabamba and those from Brazil. These results are consistent with the origin of the T. infestans populations of Brazil by a founder effect from Cochabamba. Moreover, these findings also confirm that a founder effect occurred during the dispersal of T. infestans populations in different Brazilian states.

AB  - Objectives
   Chagas disease (CD) represents a growing problem in Europe; Italy is one of the most affected countries but there is no national framework for CD and access-to-care is challenging. In 2012 Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) started an intervention in Bergamo province, where many people of Latin American origin (PLAO) are resident. A new model-of-care for CD, initiated by Centre for Tropical Diseases of Sacro Cuore Hospital, Negrar (CTD), the NGO OIKOS and the Bolivian community since 2009 in the same area, was endorsed. Hereby, we aim to describe the prevalence of CD and the treatment management outcomes among PLAO screened from 1st June 2012 to 30th June 2013.
   Methods
   Retrospective cohort study using routine program data. Screening sessions were done in Bergamo at OIKOS outpatient service and serological confirmation, staging and treatment for CD was offered at the CTD. MSF provided health education on CD, awareness generation prior to screening days, pre-test and post-test counselling through cultural mediators of Latin American origin.
   Results
   Of 1305 PLAO screened, 223(17%) had CD. Among 210 patients eligible for treatment, 102 (49%) were lost-to-follow-up before treatment. The median delay from diagnosis to treatment was 4 months (range 0.7-16.6 months). Among 108 started on treatment, 63(58%) completed treatment, 36(33%) interrupted treatment, (33 for drug side-effects, two for patients decision and one due to pregnancy), 6(6%) were lost-to-follow-up and 3(3%) were on treatment at study censuring.
   Conclusion
   In this first study focusing on process of care for CD in Italy, less than 30% of patients completed treatment with drop-outs along the cascade of care. There is an urgent need to involve affected communities and local regional health authorities to take part to this model-of-care, adapting it to the local epidemiology. The Italian health authorities should take steps in advocating for a change in the current paradigm.

AB  - The Trypanosoma comprises flagellates able to infect many mammalian species and is transmitted by several groups of invertebrates. The order Chiroptera can be infected by the subgenera Herpetosoma, Schizonypanum, Megatrypanum and Trypanozoon. In this study, we described the diversity of bats trypanosomes, inferring the phylogenetic relationships among the trypanosomes from bats caught Belo Monte Hydroeletric area (Brazilian Amazonia). Trypanosomes from bats were isolated by haemoculture, and the molecular phylogeny based on small subunit rDNA (SSU rDNA) and glycosomal-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) gene sequences. Morphological characterization included light and scanning electron microscopy. A total of 157 bats were caught in the area belonging 6 Families (Emballonuridae, Furipteridae, Mormoopidae, Natalidae, Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae) and 34 species. The bat trypanosome prevalence, as evaluated through haemoculture, was 5,7%. Phylogenetic trees grouped the isolates in T. cruzi branch (TCI and TCbat lineage), T. cruzi marinkellei and Trypanosoma wauwau from Pteronotus parnellii. This is the first isolate from T. wauwau in Para state. The occurrence of T. cruzi in the Belo Monte Hydroeletric area (UHE Belo Monte) in Amazon/Brazil attentive to the risk of migration human population required for the works of the dam and new cities that grow in the vicinity of these businesses, but it is a zoonosis already known to the Amazon region, and the presence of unclassified Trypanosoma species, attend to the large parasitic biodiversity still unknown.

AB  - Background and purposeChagas disease and ischemic stroke (IS) have a close but poorly understood correlation. In endemic settings, continued transmission over time has resulted in increasing prevalence of both asymptomatic infection and cardiomyopathy with increasing age. Latin America has made substantial progress towards Chagas disease control. Although several epidemiological studies have been conducted, information regarding epidemiology and distribution of IS in Chagas disease is still lacking.MethodsWe retrospectively studied the electronic medical record data of all patients with both IS and Chagas disease admitted at SARAH Hospitals across Brazil from 2009 to 2013 to make epidemiological quantifications and statistical inferences.ResultsA total of 279 patients with Chagas disease and IS were analyzed from 7729 IS-related admissions, indicating a median prevalence of 3.6% of Chagas disease in IS patients in our cohort. Mean age was 60 years, with female predominance (65%). Most of the cases were from Bahia (61%), followed by Minas Gerais (19%) and Goias (9.7%). Low-income cities, with decreased access to healthcare, showed the highest number of cases. Distribution of vascular risk factors and outcome after stroke differed among the units. According to current guidelines, secondary prevention was inadequate in 60% of patients.ConclusionsChagas disease was common in IS patients; prevalence of concurrent Chagas disease and IS was high in some regions of the country. However, the infection frequency seems to be reduced in the last few years. Public health issues for improving the treatment of Chagas disease and IS are urgently needed.

AB  - Introduction: Control strategies to eliminate the transmission of Chagas disease by insect vectors have significantly decreased the number of reported acute cases in Brazil. However, data regarding the incidence and distribution of acute Chagas disease cases in the State of Pernambuco are unavailable in the literature. Methods: A geographical information system was used to delineate the spatiotemporal distribution profile of the cases from 2002 to 2013 in 185 municipalities of Pernambuco based on the municipality where notification occurred. The results were presented in digital maps generated by the TerraView software (INPE). Results: A total of 302 cases of acute disease were recorded in 37.8% of the municipalities, for a total of 0.13 cases per 1,000,000 inhabitants per year. Out of the 302 cases, 99.3% were reported between 2002 and 2006. The most affected municipalities were Carnaubeira da Penha, Mirandiba and Terra Nova. The risk maps showed a significant decrease in the number of notifications and a concentration of cases in the Midwest region. Conclusions: This study highlights a significant decrease in new cases of acute Chagas disease in Pernambuco starting in 2006 when Brazil received an international certification for the interruption of vectorial transmission by Triatoma infestans. However, control strategies should still be encouraged because other triatomine species can also transmit the parasite; moreover, other transmission modes must not be neglected.

AB  - The expansion of urbanization on natural areas is increasing contact between human populations with wild animals. Wild carnivores can act as sentinel hosts or environmental health indicators. Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the exposure of two major species of wild canids from Southern Brazil to selected pathogens. For that, we live-trapped free-ranging Cerdocyon thous and Lycalopex gymnocercus in five localities and determined the frequency of animals with antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania infantum, Neospora caninum, and Leptospira spp. Among the canids sampled, 23% (12/52) (95%CI: 13-36%) had antibodies against T. gondii, with titers ranging from 64 to 512. For T. cruzi, 28% (15/52) (95%CI: 18-42%) of sampled canids were seropositive, with titers ranging from 8 to 64. Concerning the protozoan pathogen N. caninum, a total of 5% (3/52) (95%CI: 2-15%) of wild canids had antibodies against it. None of the sampled canids showed the presence of antibodies against L. infantum. On the other hand, 44% (23/52) (95%CI: 31-57%) of the wild canids showed antibodies against Leptospira spp. The set of results presented here, show that freeranging neotropical wild canids are exposed and have antibodies against to T. gondii, T. cruzi, Leptospira spp., and to a lesser degree to N. caninum. We found no evidence of L. infantum circulation among the studied populations. These results highlight some of the major pathogens which may represent risks for populations of these wild canids.

AB  - Objectives: Leishmaniasis, one of the most significant neglected diseases around the world, is caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus. Nowadays, the available aetiological treatments for leishmaniasis have variable effectiveness and several problems such as serious side effects, toxicity, high cost and an increasing number of resistance cases. Thus, there is an urgent need for safe, oral and cost-effective drugs for leishmaniases. Previously, our group has shown the effect of the ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors on Leishmania amazonensis. Herein, we showed the effect of ravuconazole against L. amazonensis; ravuconazole is a second-generation triazole antifungal drug that has good bioavailability after oral administration and a long terminal half-life in humans, a broad activity spectrum, high effectiveness in treatment of mycosis and negligible side effects.
   Methods: Several methodologies were used: cell culture, fluorescence and electron microscopy, high-resolution capillary GC coupled with MS, fluorimetry and flow cytometry.
   Results: Our results showed that ravuconazole was able to inhibit the proliferation of L. amazonensis promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes in vitro, with single-digit to sub-micromolar IC50 values, causing several alterations in the morphology, ultrastructure, cell viability and physiology of the parasites. The mitochondrion was significantly affected by the treatment, resulting in a collapse of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential that consequently led to inhibition of ATP production, combined with an increase in reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial superoxide production; by transmission electron microscopy, the organelle displayed a completely altered ultrastructure. The treatment changed the lipid profile, showing a profound depletion of the 14-desmethyl endogenous sterol pool.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that ravuconazole could be an alternative option for the treatment of leishmaniasis.

AB  - As the official journal of the Goias Medical Association, the Revista Goiana de Medicina transcended its original frontiers and became a vehicle for disseminating medical research by doctors from Central Brazil, giving them a high level of visibility. The editorial emphasis on Chagas disease, a serious rural endemic that threatened the interior of the country in the mid-twentieth century, is identified as a determining factor in the prominence achieved by them. Setting out from an analysis of articles and institutional correspondence, and taking the journal in question as both the source and object of research, the article reflects simultaneously on the importance of the Goias medical journal for the institutionalization of local medicine and its relevance among scholars of American trypanosomiasis.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas disease can be transmitted by blood transfusion. Herein, we assessed the seropositivity for Chagas disease in blood donors from Alagoas, during 2010-2020. Methods: Data were requested from the Alagoas blood center. Time trend analysis was performed using a joinpoint regression model. Results: Seropositivity rate during the study period was 0.35%, which decreased from 2014 to 2020, (annual percentage change, APC = -29.38; p-value <0.05), while the total number of tests performed remained stable (APC = 6.5). Conclusions: Despite the drop in the seropositivity for Chagas infection in donors, it is imperative to maintain the screening of donors for the epidemiological control.

AB  - Urbanization results in loss of natural habitats and, consequently, reduction of richness and abundance of specialist to the detriment of generalist species. We hypothesized that a greater richness of trypanosomatid inDidelphis albiventriswould be found in fragments of urban forests in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, that presented a larger richness of small mammals. We used parasitological, molecular, and serological methods to detectTrypanosomaspp. infection inD. albiventris(n = 43) from forest fragments. PCR was performed with primers specific for 18S rDNA, 24S alpha rDNA, mini-chromosome satellites, and mini-exon genes. IFAT was used to detect anti-Trypanosoma cruziIgG. All hemoculture was negative. We detected trypanosomatid DNA in blood of 35% of opossum. Two opossums were seropositive forT. cruzi. The trypanosomatid species number infectingD. albiventriswas higher in the areas with greater abundance, rather than richness of small mammals. We foundD. albiventrisparasitized byT. cruziin single and co-infections withLeishmaniaspp., recently described molecular operational taxonomic unit (MOTU) named DID, andTrypanosoma lainsoni. We concluded that (i) trypanosome richness may be determined by small mammal abundance, (ii)D. albiventrisconfirmed to be bio-accumulators of trypanosomatids, and (iii)T. lainsonidemonstrated a higher host range than described up to the present.

AB  - Due to migration and international travels, obstetricians are increasingly faced with a globalized obstetric setting and should adapt their daily clinical and diagnostic approach to the modifications of tropical and subtropical infections epidemiology.
   This paper is focused on five emerging infectious diseases, namely Chagas disease, HTLV-1 infection, malaria, schistosomiasis and Zika virus infection, having a high prevalence in migrant populations and which can affect international travelers. These diseases frequently pass unrecognized since they are characterized by few or no symptoms during pregnancy, however they may cause a relevant maternal, fetal and neonatal impact. Specific and reliable diagnostic and treatment options are available but are rarely used during routine obstetrical practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Benznidazole is used for treating Chagas disease (CD). This cross-sectional study aimed to characterize the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of benznidazole at a public hospital in Brazil's Federal District. Methods: Medical records were analyzed and ADRs were categorized by type. intensity, seriousness, and causality. Results: Of the 62 patients who started benznidazole treatment for CD, 41 (66%) presented with 105 ADRs; 23 (37%) discontinued the treatment. Most reactions were classified as probable (81%). severe (63%), serious (67%), and dose-dependent (56%). Conclusions: The high incidence of ADRs because of treatment withdrawal revealed the need for safer alternatives for CD treatment.

AB  - In rural Ecuador pregnant women face complex challenges navigating the terrain between traditional and biomedical maternal health care services. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in three rural communities in Southern Ecuador that have presented active Chagas disease transmission with women who were pregnant or have given birth within the last five years. This study was conducted to identify and understand the experiences of mothers in these communities and the decisions they make to maintain the wellness of themselves and their children. The researchers recorded women's maternal health stories, analyzed their access to maternal health care, and explored factors influencing their birth location preferences and health seeking behaviors. The researchers found that women in this region are utilizing medical pluralism to sustain maternal health and the well-being of their children.

AB  - The scope of this article is to analyze the trajectory of Emmanuel Dias (1908-1962), a researcher at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (OCI) and director of the Center for Studies and Prophylaxis of Chagas Disease (OCI outpost established in 1943 in the city of Bambui, Minas Gerais), as a key actor in the acknowledgement of Chagas disease as a public health problem in Brazil and the Americas. It seeks to show that the conquest of this acknowledgement, the cornerstone of which was the staging of the first campaign to combat the disease in Brazil in 1950, was made possible by the intense political mobilization of Dias together with the various social groups, such as physicians, politicians and residents of rural areas, public health officials, governments and international organizations. This mobilization occurred during the 1940s and 1950s in a historical context marked by intense debate about the relationship between health and development and helped to construct a network of alliances that was critical for the recognition of Chagas disease as a chronic cardiopathy, which threatened the productivity of rural workers and represented a medical and social problem that merited public health actions and programs geared to get it under control.

AB  - Trypanosoma (Megatrypanum) theileri is a flagellated protozoan that infects ruminants and it displays high genetic diversity. In this study, we investigated the prevalence rates of this protozoan based on hemoculture and molecular diagnosis. The isolates of T theileri thus obtained were characterized by molecular markers SSU rDNA and gGAPDH and molecular diagnosis based on Cathepsin L-like gene (PCR-TthCATL). The PCR-TthCATL and hemoculture indicated an overall prevalence rate of 8.13%, and the CATL derived sequence named IB was identified for the first time in cattle in the western Amazon region, as well as IF in Brazil. We also describe a possible new PCR-TthCATL derived sequence in cattle, designated IL.

AB  - Migration provoke changes in epidemiological profiles impinging on the health care systems of reception countries. Immigrants come to Brazil from neighbor countries usually having precarious insertion in metropolitan areas. Chagas disease is endemic in Bolivia, something that has to be taken into account by the SUS. This paper analyzes both action and limits regarding health professionals who provide services to Bolivians in SUS with a focus on Chagas disease. Interviews were applied to primary, secondary and tertiary health services in the central region of Sao Paulo, the main destination of Bolivian immigrants. The precarious living conditions of Bolivians are the cause of health inequities. Language and culture also hamper their understanding about care. There is a lack of knowledge about clinic and epidemiology aspects of Chagas disease among the professionals who attend these immigrants. It is necessary to rethink strategies of health care and control of Chagas disease.

AB  - Chagas cardiomyopathy is the most prevalent non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy in Latin America, with high morbidity and mortality even today. Treatment of these patients is based on the use of medications for heart failure. This study evaluated a case series of patients with Chagas heart disease who used sacubitril/valsartan at a referral hospital for this disease in Brazil. After 6 months, there was a symptomatic improvement in these individuals assessed by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, with a 44.3% reduction in the absolute number of patients classified as III-IV in the period (P = 0.035), but without changes in the parameters on the echocardiogram for reverse ventricular remodelling. There was a high mortality rate and number of hospitalizations. These results emphasize the importance of studying the use of sacubitril/valsartan in Chagas heart disease to better describe its effectiveness considering the particularities of these individuals.

AB  - Objective To analyse spatial patterns and the temporal tendency of mortality related to Chagas disease, in order to identify priority control areas in the state of Sergipe, Northeast Brazil. Methods We conducted an ecological and time-series study with spatial analysis techniques on deaths from Chagas disease in the state of Sergipe (1996-2016). We used data from the Mortality Information System (SIM). The temporal analysis was performed using a statistical technique capable of describing changes in the trend pattern for the period. Thematic maps were elaborated from point and polygonal analyses. Results There were 247 deaths related to Chagas disease, with a mean of 11.7 deaths/year, most of them male (64%), and aged 50-59 years (21%) and 60-69 years (26%). Two segments with increasing, non-constant and significant trends were identified: 1996-2005 (APC = 21.6%;P = 0.01) and 2005-2016 (APC = 4.4%;P = 0.01), with APPC = 11.8% (P = 0.01). A positive and significant spatial autocorrelation with areas of higher risk of death was found in the southern region of the state. Conclusions The trend of mortality related to Chagas disease in the state of Sergipe was increasing during the period analysed, with a heterogeneous distribution of cases. A main risk area was identified in the southern region of the state.

AB  - Orally-transmitted acute Chagas disease (CD) is emerging as an important public health problem. The prognosis of acute infection following oral transmission is unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze and summarize data on orally-transmitted acute CD. We searched for publications from 1968 to 31 January 2018. We included studies and unpublished data from government sources that reported patients with acute orally-transmitted CD. We identified 41 papers and we added 932 unpublished cases. In all, our study covered 2470 cases and occurrence of 97 deaths. Our meta-analysis estimated that the case-fatality rate was 1.0% (95% CI 0.0-4.0%). Lethality rates have declined over time (P = .02). In conclusion, orally-transmitted acute CD has considerable lethality in the first year after infection. The lethality in symptomatic cases is similar to that from other routes of infection. The lethality rate of orally-acquired disease has declined over the years.

AB  - Callithrix jacchus and C. penicillata marmosets are invasive to the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, threatening the native and vulnerable C. aurita. Both invasive species can be hosts of Trypanosoma cruzi, T. minasense, T. rangeli and T. devei. We aim to investigate the occurrence of trypanosomatids in Callithrix sp. from Jardim Botanico do Rio de Janeiro, located in a central and populous area of the city. Fifteen marmosets were captured. Blood samples were collected for light microscopy and molecular genetics analysis. Parasites morphometric values were evaluated for species identification. DNA was extracted from blood samples by phenol-chloroform method, for partial amplification of the 18S rRNA gene. PCR products were sequenced and aligned using BLAST (R). A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed to analyze the proximity between the observed sequences. By light microscopy, trypomastigotes were detected in five of the fifteen marmosets. Morphometric measurements and size polymorphism corresponded to those previously described for T. minasense. The DNA sequences of approximately 600 base pairs of the 18S rRNA gene were obtained for three samples with 99% identity with T. minasense sequence, forming a cluster in the phylogenetic tree and corroborating morphometric analysis. Trypanosoma minasense is a highly specific parasite to non-human primates considered as non-pathogenic. There is no evidence of infection in humans and these parasite findings from invasive marmosets do not support additional risks for the native species.

AB  - The objective is to map the scientific publications of research involving stem cells associated with Chagas disease. We used bibliometric and social network analysis techniques to analyze scientific data collected in the Web of Science. Most of the articles were published in 2014 and 2015. The organizations and authors with the largest number of publications and research collaborations are located in america, specifically in Brazil and the United States, which are responsible for 62% of all publications. FIOCRUZ, UFRJ, and Hospital Sao Rafael together account for approximately 55% of the studies related to stem cells associated with Chagas disease. Most of the studies focus on developing new strategies for treating Chagas disease using stem cells. This suggests that the research agenda in this area is still under development, highlighting the importance of continuing to pursue existing research avenues and expanding the range of strategies for the treatment of the disease.

AB  - Background
   Chagas disease has become a challenge for non-endemic countries since population mobility has increased in recent years and it has spread to these regions. In order to prevent vertical transmission and improve the prognosis of the disease, it is important to make an early diagnosis. And to develop strategies that improve access to diagnosis, it is important to know the factors that most influence the decision of the population to know their serological status. For this reason, this study uses Andersen's Behavioural Model and its proposed strategies to explore the health behaviours of Bolivian population.
   Methods
   Twenty-three interviews, two focus groups, and two triangular groups were performed with Bolivian men and women, involving a total of 39 participants. In addition, four interviews were conducted with key informants in contact with Bolivian population to delve into possible strategies to improve the Chagas diagnosis.
   Results
   The most relevant facts for the decision to being diagnosed pointed out by participants were having relatives who were sick or deceased from Chagas disease or, for men, having their pregnant wife with a positive result. After living in Spain more than ten years, population at risk no longer feels identified with their former rural origin and the vector. Moreover, their knowledge and awareness about diagnosis and treatment still remains low, especially in younger people. Limitations on access to healthcare professionals and services were also mentioned, and proposed strategies focused on eliminating these barriers and educating the population in preventive behaviours.
   Conclusions
   Based on Andersen's Behavioural Model, the results obtained regarding the factors that most influence the decision to carry out Chagas diagnosis provide information that could help to develop strategies to improve access to health services and modify health behaviours related to Chagas screening.

AB  - Purpose We have established a prospective cohort of 1959 patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy to evaluate if a clinical prediction rule based on ECG, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, and other biomarkers can be useful in clinical practice. This paper outlines the study and baseline characteristics of the participants.
   Participants The study is being conducted in 21 municipalities of the northern part of Minas Gerais State in Brazil, and includes a follow-up of 2years. The baseline evaluation included collection of sociodemographic information, social determinants of health, health-related behaviours, comorbidities, medicines in use, history of previous treatment for Chagas disease, functional class, quality of life, blood sample collection, and ECG. Patients were mostly female, aged 50-74years, with low family income and educational level, with known Chagas disease for >10years; 46% presented with functional class >II. Previous use of benznidazole was reported by 25.2% and permanent use of pacemaker by 6.2%. Almost half of the patients presented with high blood cholesterol and hypertension, and one-third of them had diabetes mellitus. N-terminal of the prohormone BNP (NT-ProBNP) level was >300pg/mL in 30% of the sample.
   Findings to date Clinical and laboratory markers predictive of severe and progressive Chagas disease were identified as high NT-ProBNP levels, as well as symptoms of advanced heart failure. These results confirm the important residual morbidity of Chagas disease in the remote areas, thus supporting political decisions that should prioritise in addition to epidemiological surveillance the medical treatment of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy in the coming years. The SAo Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical Medicine Research Center (SaMi-Trop) represents a major challenge for focused research in neglected diseases, with knowledge that can be applied in primary healthcare.
   Future plans We will continue following this patients' cohort to provide relevant information about the development and progression of Chagas disease in remotes areas, with social and economic inequalities.

AB  - We surveyed infection by Trypanosoma spp. and Leishmania spp. in small wild mammals from Cumari, Goias State aiming to investigate the diversity of trypanosomatid in a modified landscape of the Brazilian Cerrado (and possible infection overlapping with canids from the same area). Blood, skin, spleen, and liver samples were collected for parasitological, serological, and molecular assays. Gracilinanus agilis was the most abundant species (N = 70; 48.6%) and it was the only one with patent parasitemia. Characterization by mini-exon and 18SrDNA targets were achieved in 7/10 hemocultures with positive fresh blood examination, which confirmed the T. cruzi infection by Discrete Typing Units (DTU) TcI in single (N = 2) and mixed infections with other DTUs (N = 5). T. rangeli and T. dionisii were detected in skin fragments from Didelphis albiventris and Oecomys cleberi, respectively. G. agilis were found to be infected by L. braziliensis and L. guyanensis, while Leishmania sp. DNA was detected in the liver of Oligoryzomys nigripes and Calomys expulsus. Subpatent infection by T. cruzi and Leishmania sp. was serologically detected in 15% and 9% of the small mammal fauna, respectively. Small mammals from Cumari are included in T. cruzi and Leshmania spp. transmission cycles, showing a higher diversity of trypanosomatid species and/or genotypes than that observed in canids of the same agroecosystem.

AB  - After the United States, Spain comes second in the list of countries receiving migrants from Latin America, and, therefore, it is the European country with the highest expected number of infected patients of Chagas disease. We have studied the National Health System's Hospital Discharge Records Database (CMBD) in order to describe the disease evolution from 1997 to 2011 in Spain. We performed a retrospective descriptive study using CMBD information on hospitalizations including Chagas disease. Data was divided in two periods with similar length in time: 1997-2004 and 2005-2011. Hospitalization rates were calculated and clinical characteristics were described. We used multivariable logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds-ratio (aOR) for the association between various conditions and being hospitalized with organ affectation. A total of 1729 hospitalization records were identified. Hospitalization rates for the two periods were 18 and 242.8/100000 population, respectively. The median age was 35 years (range 0-87), 74% were female and the 16-45 age-group was mostly represented (69.8%). Overall, 23.4% hospitalizations included the diagnosis of Chagas disease with organ complications. Being male [aOR: 1.3 (1.00-1.77)], aged 45 and 64 years [ aOR: 2.59 (1.42-4.71)], and a median hospitalization cost above 3,065 euro [aOR: 2.03 (3.73-7.86)] were associated with hospitalizations with organ affectation. Since 2005, the number of detected infections increased in Spain. The predominant patients' profile (asymptomatic women at fertile age) and the conditions associated with organ affectation underlines the need for increased efforts towards the early detection of T cruzi.

AB  - Background and Aims: Chagas disease is a common cause of heart failure (HF) and death in developing countries. Although stroke is known to occur in these patients, an accurate estimate of stroke incidence is lacking. We aimed to determine the incidence of stroke and death in patients with HF, comparing Chagas and non-Chagas etiologies.
   Methods: Cohort of stroke-free patients with HF (Framingham criteria) followed in a university-based outpatient clinic in Brazil. Baseline characteristics included sociodemographic, risk factor assessment, echocardiographic and electrocardiographic findings. Chagas disease was defined by appropriate serologic tests. Cause-specific Cox regression was used to search for predictors of stroke or death as separate outcomes.
   Results: We studied 565 patients with HF between January 2003 and December 2018, mean age 54.3 +/- 12.9 years, 305 (54.0%) females, 271/535 (50.7%) with Chagas disease. Chagas patients were older (55.5 vs. 53.1 years), more frequently women (60.5% vs. 47.3%), less frequently harbored coronary artery disease (14.5% vs. 34.1%) when compared to non-Chagas patients. Echocardiography showed more severe disease among non-Chagas patients [median left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) 37.3% vs. 47.0%]. Over a mean 42.9 (+/- 34.4) months, we followed 404 (71.5%) patients, completing 1442 patient-years of follow-up. Stroke incidence was higher in Chagas when compared to non-Chagas patients (20.2 vs. 13.9 events per 1000 patient-years), while death rate was similar (41.6 vs. 43.1 deaths per 1000 patient-years). In the multivariable analysis for stroke outcome adjusted for LVEF and arrhythmias, cause-specific hazard ratio (CSHR) for Chagas was 2.54 (95% confidence interval 1.01-6.42, p = 0.048). Chagas disease was also associated with increased risk of death (CSHR 1.83; 95% confidence interval 1.04-3.24, p = 0.037).
   Conclusion: Chagas disease is associated with increased risk of stroke and death when compared to other etiologies of HF, independently of HF severity or cardiac arrhythmias, suggesting other factors contribute to increased stroke risk and mortality in Chagas disease. Early prevention and treatment of Chagas disease is imperative to reduce a later risk of stroke in endemic areas.

AB  - Severe fetal growth restriction (FGR) affects 1 in 500 pregnancies, is untreatable, and causes serious neonatal morbidity and death. Reduced uterine blood flow (UBF) is one cause. Transduction of uterine arteries in normal and FGR animal models using an adenovirus (Ad) encoding VEGF isoforms increases UBF and improves fetal growth in utero. Understanding potential adverse consequences of this therapy before first-in-woman clinical application is essential. The aims of this study were to determine whether Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C (1) transfers across the human placental barrier and (2) affects human placental morphology, permeability and primary indicators of placental function, and trophoblast integrity. Villous explants from normal term human placentas were treated with Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C (5x10(7-10) virus particles [vp]/mL), or virus formulation buffer (FB). Villous structural integrity (hematoxylin and eosin staining) and tissue accessibility (LacZ immunostaining) were determined. Markers of endocrine function (human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] secretion) and cell death (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] release) were assayed. Lobules from normal and FGR pregnancies underwent ex vivo dual perfusion with exposure to 5x10(10) vp/mL Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C or FB. Perfusion resistance, para-cellular permeability, hCG, alkaline phosphatase, and LDH release were measured. Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C transfer across the placental barrier was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in DNA extracted from fetal-side venous perfusate, and by immunohistochemistry in fixed tissue. Villous explant structural integrity and hCG secretion was maintained at all Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C doses. Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C perfusion revealed no effect on placental permeability, fetoplacental vascular resistance, hCG secretion, or alkaline phosphatase release, but there was a minor elevation in maternal-side LDH release. Viral vector tissue access in both explant and perfused models was minimal, and the vector was rarely detected in the fetal venous perfusate and at low titer. Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C did not markedly affect human placental integrity and function in vitro. There was limited tissue access and transfer of vector across the placental barrier. Except for a minor elevation in LDH release, these test data did not reveal any toxic effects of Ad.VEGF-D-Delta N Delta C on the human placenta.

AB  - After more than one century since its discovery, Chagas disease is still extremely prevalent in 21 Latin American countries. Chagas disease is one of the most concerning public health problems in Latin America; the overall cost of CD treatment is approximately 7 billion United States dollars per year and it has a strong social impact on populations. Little progress has been made regarding the access to diagnosis and treatment at the primary health care level, calling into question the current policies to ensure the right to health and access to essential medications. In this article, diverse dimensions of access to treatment for Chagas disease are reviewed, illustrating the present state of benznidazole medication in relation to global production capacity, costs, and needs. The findings are based on an investigation requested by Medecins Sans Frontieres Brazil through a consultancy in 2015, aiming to estimate the current costs of benznidazole production.

AB  - Background: Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) prevail in conditions of poverty and contribute to the maintenance of social inequality. Out of the NTDs prioritized by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, four parasitic infections require mandatory notification: acute Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, malaria, and schistosomiasis. Data on the behaviour of these NTDs in the young population are currently limited. This study seeks to analyse the epidemiological aspects of these parasitic infections in children and adolescents in Brazil.
   Methods: A retrospective exploratory ecological study was conducted. A spatial analysis of the cases reported between 2009 and 2013 in individuals aged between 0 and 19 years that were notified through the Health Notification Aggravation Information System (SINAN) was performed.
   Results: In total, 64,567 cases of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, malaria, schistosomiasis, and acute Chagas disease were recorded in the SINAN database, representing a rate of 20.15 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The average age of the cases was 12.2 years and 62.32% were male. Four hundred and three deaths related to these obligatorily reported parasites were recorded, indicating a case fatality rate of 0.62%. Visceral leishmaniasis and acute Chagas disease had the highest rates of lethality. A heterogeneous spatial distribution of the studied parasites was observed.
   Conclusions: The number of cases and the lethality rate described in this study show that these diseases still represent a serious problem for public health in Brazil. This points to the need to encourage new research and the reformulation of social, economic, and public health policies aimed at ensuring better health and living conditions for all individuals, especially those among the populations considered vulnerable, as is the case of the young.

AB  - The aim of this article was to confirm and describe an outbreak of acute Chagas disease involving oral transmission in the western region of Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil. This was a descriptive case series study in which the data sources were medical records and interviews with suspected cases from September 16 to November 19, 2015. An entomological investigation was conducted in the probable sites of infection for acute Chagas disease cases. Eighteen cases of acute Chagas disease were confirmed in residents of four municipalities (counties) in Rio Grande do Norte State. The most frequently reported signs and symptoms were fever and weakness (n = 18), followed by myalgia (n = 17), prostration, loss of appetite, and edema of the lower limbs (n = 15). Median duration of fever was 20 days (range: 6 to 45 days). Fifteen cases were confirmed by the laboratory criterion and three by epidemiological link with consistent clinical characteristics. All confirmed cases reported having consumed sugar cane juice from the same mill. A total of 110 triatomines were captured on the plantation where the sugar cane had been crushed for juice. The insects were found in the peridomicile, in stacks of firewood and close to the sugar cane mill. The majority of the captured specimens were Triatoma brasiliensis and showed a natural infection rate of 63%. The Chagas disease outbreak was confirmed with oral transmission via ingestion of sugar cane juice contaminated with infected triatomines, as evidenced by the epidemiological link between the investigated cases and the entomological survey in the probable site where the infection occurred.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected disease and endemic in Brazil. In the Brazilian Northeast Region, it affects millions of people. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the spatiotemporal trends of CD mortality in the Northeast of Brazil. This ecological study was designed, in which the unit of analysis was the municipality of the Brazilian northeast. The data source was the Information System of Mortality. It was calculated relative risk from socioeconomic characteristics. Mortality rates were smoothed by the Local Empirical Bayes method. Spatial dependency was analysed by the Global and Local Moran Index. Scan spatial statistics were also used. A total of 11 287 deaths by CD were notified in the study. An expressive parcel of this number was observed among 70-year-olds or more (n = 4381; 38.8%), no schooling (n = 4381; 38.8%), mixed-race (n = 4381; 62.3%), male (n = 6875; 60.9%). It was observed positive spatial autocorrelation, mostly in municipalities of the state of Bahia, Piaui (with high-high clusters), and Maranhao (with low-low clusters). The spatial scan statistics has presented a risk of mortality in 24 purely spatial clusters (P < 0.05). The study has identified the spatial pattern of CD mortality mostly in Bahia and Piaui, highlighting priority areas in planning and control strategies of the health services.

AB  - Objectives: This paper presents the results of the design and implementation process for the policy of compulsory notification of chronic Chagas disease in the Brazilian state of Goias (Resolution No. 004/2013-GAB/SES-GO). Methods: The narrative was based on information provided by key actors that were part of the different stages of the process, built on contextual axes based on participants' reflections about the establishment of the most accurate and coherent notification mechanisms. Results: The notification policy addressed the absence of historical data from patients in the state Chagas program, an increase in cases identified through serology, and weaknesses in vector control. Two key challenges involved human resources capacity and dissemination to public agencies and health care workers. Effective training and communication processes were key ingredients for successful implementation. Conclusions: The lack of public health measures aimed at the epidemiological surveillance of chronic Chagas cases constitutes a significant barrier for patients to access appropriate diagnosis, management and follow-up, and hampers the planning of necessary activities within health systems. The implementation of the notification policy in Goias allows authorities to determine the real magnitude of Chagas disease in the population, so that an appropriate public health response can be mounted to meet the needs of affected people, thereby ending the epidemiological silence of Chagas disease.

AB  - Chagas disease represents one of the major health issue in Latin America. Epidemiological control is focused on disease vectors, so studies on the ecology of triatomine vectors constitute a central strategy. Recently, research at large spatial scale has been produced, and authors commonly rely on the assumption that geographical regions presenting good environmental conditions for most vector species are also those with high risk of infection. In the present work, we provide an explicit evaluation for this assumption. Employing species distribution models and epidemiological data for Chagas disease in Brazilian territory, our results show that species richness is a poor predictor for the observed pattern of Chagas disease occurrence. Species composition proved to be a better predictor. We stress that research on macroecology of infectious diseases should go beyond the analysis of biodiversity patterns and consider human infections as a central part of the focal ecological systems.

AB  - Objectives This manuscript aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of Chagas's disease in the population of rural communities at Campinas do Piaui city, State of Piaui, Brazil.
   Methods The techniques of the indirect immunofluorescence reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect reagent samples for Chagas disease and estimate its prevalence in the rural population. Blood samples were collected on filter paper through digital and venipuncture. Blood samples with reactive or indeterminate results were re-evaluated and subjected to the test by ELISA.
   Results In total, 763 blood samples were analysed from 161 residences of 18 rural communities, collected in residents aged between 2 and 92 years. In the indirect immunofluorescence reaction technique, 44 (5.8%) of the results were positive, being 40 (5.2%) confirmed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Among the communities surveyed, we observed reactive cases in 15 of them, these cases being distributed, according to the age group, as follows: 1 case from 0 to 10 years; 13 cases from 11 to 60 years old; and 30 cases over 61 years.
   Conclusion The results indicate that Chagas's disease remains with active transmission in the Campinas do Piaui city according to the occurrence of a case in a resident under 10 years of age. The region is endemic for Chagas's disease, as observed by the high prevalence of positive cases.

AB  - The present study aimed to diagnose the natural infection of captive and free-living procyonids with Trypanosoma evansi in the states of Amapa and Para, Brazil. From February 2012 to August 2013, whole blood samples and blood smears were obtained from 45 free-living procyonids and from nine procyonids kept in captivity in wild life refuges and zoobotanical parks in the states of Amapa and Para. Whole blood samples were collected and kept at -20 degrees C for the detection of T. evansi DNA by PCR using the RoTat 1.2 forward and RoTat 1.2 reverse primers. In addition, the blood smears were processed and examined for the presence of trypomastigote forms of T. evansi. T. evansi DNA was detected in 18.52% (10/54) of the procyonids, namely, in captive crabeating raccoons and captive and free-living coatis in Para State. No trypomastigote forms were observed in the blood smears. DNA from T. evansi was detected in P. cancrivorus and N. nasua in Para State, being this the first such report in P. cancrivorus.

AB  - Introduction: Studying the feeding preferences of triatomines is an important entomological surveillance tool, since continuous surveillance of the disease is necessary. Methods: The precipitin reaction was used to describe the feeding preferences of triatomines along with their natural infection by flagellates similar to Tyrpanosoma cruzi. Six hundred eighty-seven insects were examined, including Triatoma brasiliensis, Triatoma pseudomaculata, and Panstrongylus lutzi. Results: Sixty-nine (10%) of 687 triatomines examined tested positive for flagellates similar to T. cruzi, and 8 (1.2%) of these fed on human blood. Conclusions: This study found potential transmitters of Chagas disease both inside and outside the domiciliar environment.

AB  - Introduction: Triatomines are targeted for the control of Chagas disease in endemic areas of Brazil. Methods: Data regarding triatomines captured during 2001-2008 in 34 municipalities in the Northeast of Minas Gerais were analyzed. Results: In total, 11,187 triatomines from eight species were captured, mostly in henhouses and bedrooms. Trypanosomes were found in 203 samples. Main species were Triatoma sordida, Panstrongylus megistus, and Triatoma vitticeps. The number of P. megistus adults was positively correlated with temperature and precipitation, whereas the number of nymphs followed the inverse pattern. Conclusions: Occurrence of triatomines in domiciles indicates the need for sustained entomological surveillance.

AB  - Trypanosoma rangeli is a generalist hemoflagellate that infects mammals and is transmitted by triatomines around Latin America. Due to its high genetic diversity, it can be classified into two to five lineages. In Brazil, its distribution outside the Amazon region is virtually unknown, and knowledge on the ecology of its lineages and on host species diversity requires further investigation. Here, we analyzed 57 T. rangeli samples obtained from hemocultures and blood clots of 1392 mammals captured in different Brazilian biomes. The samples were subjected to small subunit (SSU) rDNA amplification and sequencing to confirm T. rangeli infection. Phylogenetic inferences and haplotype networks were reconstructed to classify T. rangeli lineages and to infer the genetic diversity of the samples. The results obtained in our study highlighted both the mammalian host range and distribution of T. rangeli in Brazil: infection was observed in five new species (Procyon cancrivorous, Priodontes maximum, Alouatta belzebul, Sapajus libidinosus, and Trinomys dimidiatus), and transmission was observed in the Caatinga biome. The coati (Nasua nasua) and capuchin monkey (S. libidinosus) are the key hosts of T. rangeli. We identified all four T. rangeli lineages previously reported in Brazil (A, B, D, and E) and possibly two new genotypes.

AB  - Propolis is known for its biological properties and its preparations have been continuously investigated in an attempt to solve the problem of their standardization, an issue that limits the use of propolis in food and pharmaceutical industries. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiparasitic, and cytotoxic effects of extracts of red, green, and brown propolis from different regions of Brazil, obtained by ethanolic and supercritical extraction methods. We found that propolis extracts obtained by both these methods showed concentration-dependent antioxidant activity. The extracts obtained by ethanolic extraction showed higher antioxidant activity than that shown by the extracts obtained by supercritical extraction. Ethanolic extracts of red propolis exhibited up to 98% of the maximum antioxidant activity at the highest extract concentration. Red propolis extracts obtained by ethanolic and supercritical methods showed the highest levels of antimicrobial activity against several bacteria. Most extracts demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. None of the extracts analyzed showed activity against Escherichia coli or Candida albicans. An inhibitory effect of all tested ethanolic extracts on the growth of Trypanosoma cruzi Y strain epimastigotes was observed in the first 24 h. However, after 96 h, a persistent inhibitory effect was detected only for red propolis samples. Only ethanolic extracts of red propolis samples R01Et.B2 and R02Et.B2 showed a cytotoxic effect against all four cancer cell lines tested (HL-60, HCT-116, OVCAR-8, and SF-295), indicating that red propolis extracts have great cytotoxic potential. The biological effects of ethanolic extracts of red propolis revealed in the present study suggest that red propolis can be a potential alternative therapeutic treatment against Chagas disease and some types of cancer, although high activity of red propolis in vitro needs to be confirmed by future in vivo investigations.

AB  - Introduction: Triatomine bugs are hematophagous insects that are extremely important in public health because they are natural vectors of Thpanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. In this study, we aimed to assess the occurrence of triatomine species and the natural T cruzi infection in the Guaribas Valley territory', an endemic region for Chagas disease in northeastern Brazil. Methods: Insects were actively captured from July 2017 to October 2019 in the intra- and peridomiciles of 16 municipalities of the Guaribas Valley territory, in the southeast area of Piaui state. Triatomine species were identified following a taxonomic key, and natural infection was investigated through insects' fresh feces exams. Results: A total of 430 triatomines were collected, including 211 nymphs and 219 adults. Of all collected specimens, 39 (9.1%) were from the intradomiciles and 391 (90.9%) from peridomiciles. Nine species, including two subspecies, could be identified: Triatoma brasiliensis brasiliensis, T. brasiliensis macromelasoma, T. pseudomaculata, T. sordida, T. juazeirensis, T. melanocephala, Panstrongylus lutzi, Rhodnius domesticus, R. nasutus, and R. robustus. T. brasiliensis were the most frequently collected bugs, representing 72% of all the identified insects. None of the examined invertebrates presented flagellate forms of T. cruzi. Conclusions: This is the first report of T. b. macromelasoma and T. juazeirensis in the Guaribas Valley territory. The persistence of triatomine species in the domiciles in an endemic area for Chagas disease emphasizes the relevance of entomological surveillance and vector control measures in the studied area.

AB  - Introduction: This communication reports the occurrence of Rhodnius neglectus in the State of Acre, Brazil. Methods: An adult male R. neglectus specimen was collected from the Catuaba Experimental Reserve, which is located in the municipality of Senador Guiomard. Results: This increases the number of triatomine species reported from the State of Acre to eight and is also the first report of R. neglectus from the Brazilian Western Amazon Region. Conclusions: The occurrence of R. neglectus is alarming because even though the species is wild, it can invade and colonize human dwellings and peridomiciles, thereby increasing Chagas disease transmission.

AB  - The emerging vector of Chagas disease, Triatoma maculata (Hemiptera, Reduviidae), is one of the most widely distributed Triatoma species in northern South America. Despite its increasing relevance as a vector, no consistent picture of the magnitude of genetic and phenetic diversity has yet been developed. Here, several populations of T. maculata from eleven Colombia and Venezuela localities were analyzed based on the morphometry of wings and the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) gene sequences. Our results showed clear morphometric and genetic differences among Colombian and Venezuelan populations, indicating high intraspecific diversity. Inter-population divergence is suggested related to East Cordillera in Colombia. Analyses of other populations from Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil from distinct eco-geographic regions are still needed to understand its systematics and phylogeography as well as its actual role as a vector of Chagas disease.

AB  - Objective: To assess the quality of triatomine identification in the laboratory network of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Methods: The participating laboratories received support material with dichotomous keys and a panel made up of seven triatomine insects known in the Pernambuco, in order to identify specimen status on receipt (intact or damaged structure), as well as species and sex. Results: Nine out of 12 laboratories took part of the study. The proportion of correct answers was 56/63 for sex identification, and 45/63, for species. The answers did not present a direct relationship with occurrence of damage to morphological structures during insect transportation. Panstrongylus megistus identification was correct for all specimens (9/9 laboratories), while correct identification of species of the Rhodnius genus was the lowest (3/9 laboratories). Conclusion: Despite the good performance in entomological identification, the weaknesses observed may guide improvements in the laboratory network and will be essential for Chagas disease vector control programs.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is recognized by the World Health Organization as one of the thirteen most neglected tropical diseases in the world. Self-perceived health is considered a better predictor of mortality than objective measures of health status, and the context in which one lives influences this predictor. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and individual and contextual factors associated with poor self-rated health among CD patients from an endemic region in Brazil. It is a multilevel cross-sectional study. The individual data come from a cross-section of a cohort study named SaMi-Trop. Contextual data was collected from publicly accessible institutional information systems and platforms. The dependent variable was self-perceived health. The analysis was performed using multilevel binary logistic regression. The study included 1,513 patients with CD, where 335 (22.1%) had Poor self-rated health. This study revealed the influence of the organization/ offer of the Brazilian public health service and of individual characteristics on the self-perceived health of patients with CD.

AB  - It is well documented that Chagas disease (CD) can pose a public health problem to countries. As one of the World Health Organization Neglected Tropical Diseases undoubtedly calls for comprehensive healthcare, transcending a restricted biomedical approach. After more than a century since their discovery, in 1909, people affected by CD are still frequently marginalised and/or neglected. The aim of this article is to tell the story of their activism, highlighting key historical experiences and successful initiatives, from 1909 to 2019. The first association was created in 1987, in the city of Recife, Brazil. So far, thirty associations have been reported on five continents. They were created as independent non-profit civil society organisations and run democratically by affected people. Among the common associations' objectives, we notably find: increase the visibility of the affected; make their voice heard; build bridges between patients, health system professionals, public health officials, policy makers and the academic and scientific communities. The International Federation of Associations of People Affected by CD - FINDECHAGAS, created in 2010 with the input of the Americas, Europe and the Western Pacific, counts as one of the main responses to the globalisation of CD. Despite all the obstacles and difficulties encountered, the Federation has thrived, grown, and matured. As a result of this mobilisation along with the support of many national and international partners, in May 2019 the 72nd World Health Assembly decided to establish World Chagas Disease Day, on 14 April. The associative movement has increased the understanding of the challenges related to the disease and breaks the silence around Chagas disease, improving surveillance, and sustaining engagement towards the United Nations 2030 agenda.

AB  - By controlling the transmission of Chagas disease, the challenge of providing assistance to millions of infected patients that reach old age arises. In this study, the socioeconomic, demographic and comorbidity records of all elderly chagasic patients followed at the Pharmaceutical Care Service of the Chagas Disease Research Laboratory were assessed. The information related to the clinical form of the disease was obtained from medical records provided by the Walter Cantidio University Hospital. The profile of the studied population was: women (50.5%); mean age of 67 years; retired (54.6%); married (51.6 %); high illiteracy rate (40.2%); and family income equal to the minimum wage (51.5%). The predominant clinical forms of Chagas disease were cardiac (65.3%) and indeterminate (14.7%). The main electrocardiographic changes were the right bundle branch block (41.0%), associated or not with the anterosuperior left bundle branch block (27.4%). The average number of comorbidities per patient was 2.23 +/- 1.54, with systemic arterial hypertension being the main one found (67.0%). It was found that the elderly comprise a vulnerable group of patients that associate aging with cardiac and/or digestive disorders resulting from the evolution of Chagas disease and other comorbidities, which requires special attention from health services to ensure more appropriate medical and social care.

AB  - Objective: To analyze temporal trends and spatial patterns of mortality due to neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in Piaui, Brazil 2001-2018. Methods: This was a mixed ecological study, with risk ratio (PR) calculation, spatiotemporal trend analysis, Poisson join point regression, using data from the Mortality Information System. Results: There were 2,609 deaths due to NTDs in the period (460/700,000 inhabitants), 55.2% were due to Chagas' disease. There was a higher risk of death in male (RR=7.76; 95%CI 7.25;2.46), being aged >= 60 years (RR=40.71; 95%CI 10.01;16553), municipalities with medium vulnerability social (RR=1.76; 95%CI 1.09;2.84), smaller population size (RR=1.99; 95%CI 7.28;3.10) and the Cerrados macro-region (RR=4.57; 95%CI 257;8.77). There was an upward trend in mortality rates from 2001-2008 and a falling trend from 2009-2078. Conclusion: Mortality due to NTDs in Piaui remains high, particularly due to Chagas' disease, among groups with greater vulnerability, with concentration of higher rates in the southwest of the Semiarid macro-region and the northeast and south of the Cerrados macro-region.

AB  - Approaching from the perspective of the history and social studies of science, the article analyses some aspects of the early history of Chagas disease, from its discovery through initial research. It is our goal to show that historians of science can explore this topic as a way not only of remembering and narrating past events but also of examining the processes through which science is produced. To this end, we present five basic precepts that have guided historical and sociological studies of "science in action": science as a collective endeavor, as a social activity, as a set of practices, as a process that involves controversies, and as a formative process. By examining the topic in the light of these five points, we demonstrate how the history of this successful research tradition can lead us to broader reflections about the complex dynamics interweaving science and society.

AB  - Despite the drastic decrease in the incidence of Chagas disease in Brazil, past cases still greatly impact health services in the country. Thus, this study aimed to characterize Chagas disease cases regarding their cardiac staging and death prognosis and, based on that, to propose primary healthcare (PHC) case follow-ups. This is a cross-sectional study based on secondary data from the medical records of patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC). A logistic regression was applied to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR). A total of 433 medical records were evaluated. More severe CCC cases were associated with a greater number of hospitalizations (OR = 3.41; 95%CI: 1.59-7.30) and longer hospitalization (OR = 3.15; 95%CI: 1.79-5.53). Cases with a higher risk of death were associated with a higher number of hospitalizations (OR = 1.92; 95%CI: 1.09-3.37), longer hospital stays (OR = 2.04; 95%CI: 1.30-3.18), and visits to the outpatient clinic (OR = 2.18; 95%CI: 1.39-3.41) and the emergency department of the assessed hospital (OR = 3.12; 95%CI: 1.27-7.66). Analyzing the medical records at two moments, 72.9% of the cases remained in the stages in which they were initially evaluated. Overall, 44.4% of cases were classified as mild to moderate risk of death and 68.3% as low ones. The cases classified in the most severe stages of CCC and with high or intermediate risk of death were associated with greater hospital dependence. However, most cases were classified as milder forms of the disease, with a low risk of death and clinical stability. These findings aim to promote the role of PHC as a protagonist in the longitudinal follow-up of CCC cases in Brazil.

AB  - Context: Croton cajucara Benth has been widely used in folk medicine, especially in the Amazonian region of Brazil, to treat several illnesses. Objectives: The objective of the study is to evaluate the stem bark hydroalcoholic extract (CC-EHA) of C. cajucara and their clerodane-type diterpene fractions (F1-7, F25-27, and F28) on promastigotes and axenic amastigotes of Leishmania amazonensis and trypomastigotes and epimastigotes of Trypanosoma cruzi. Materials and Methods: The extract was obtained in ethanol: water and the fractions with solvents of increasing polarity. The antiparasitic activities were assessed by 3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method against promastigotes and axenic amastigotes from L. amazonensis in 24-h cultures and trypomastigotes and epimastigotes of T. cruzi in 72-h cultures. The experiments in triplicate were made in quadruplicate way in each time. The statistical tests used were t-Students and ANOVA. Results: Among those evaluated samples, the CC-EHA extract showed the higher antileishmanial activity of promastigote cultures (IC50 = 18.00 +/- 0.01 mu g/mL at 24 h). However, against axenic amastigotes, the polar fraction (F28), rich in diterpene transdehydrocrotonin (t-DCTN), showed the highest effect with an IC50 = 6.18 +/- 0.02 mu g/mL in culture of 24 h. In the T. cruzi assays, F28 also showed the greatest effect against trypomastigotes and epimastigotes, IC50 = 0.43 +/- 0.02 mu g/mL and 0.27 +/- 0.02 mu g/mL, respectively, at 72 h of culture. The results showed that the diterpene t-DCTN is the most important antiparasitic component in the hydroalcoholic extract obtained from C. cajucara, specifically against L. amazonensis and T. cruzi. Conclusion: Our results contribute to knowledge of these folk medicinal species as a promising antiparasitic phytotherapeutic alternative.

AB  - Background In the Brazilian Amazon, a new epidemiological profile of Chagas disease transmission, the oral route, has been detected and cited as being responsible for the increase in acute cases in Brazil. The clinical evaluation of acute Chagas disease (ACD) has been a challenge since it can progress to a chronic phase with cardiac alterations, and the follow-up by modern diagnostic methods is very difficult due to the socio-geographical characteristics of the Brazilian Amazon. Thus, alternatives should be sought to alleviate this problem. We conducted a study to evaluate subjects with ACD using the 12-lead ECG QRS score (Selvester score) as an estimative of myocardial injury progression before and after ACD treatment. Methods The study included indigenous subjects from the Amazon region with ACD in clinical follow-up at the Fundacao de Medicina Tropical Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) Chagas Disease outpatient clinic in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. The control group consisted of 31 healthy volunteers with no history of heart disease and no reactive serology for Chagas disease. Baseline ECG was performed in all subjects. The Selvester scoring method was performed according to the standardized guide (< 3 points: no myocardial injury,> 3: points x 3% = % of the predicted LV infarction). Results A total of 62 subjects were included, 31 as cases and 31 as controls. The mean follow-up of the case group was 17 months. The control group presented normal ECG. The case group presented 13 alterations before treatment and 11 after. Nineteen individuals presented scores > 3 points, 6 before and 13 after. In 19.36% of subjects, myocardial injury was found before treatment and in 41.94% after treatment. Conclusion This is the first study that uses the Selvester score (SS) to predict myocardial injury in subjects with ACD. The results of this study suggest the significant presence of myocardial injury from the beginning of treatment to the period post treatment of ACD, which demonstrates that the SS can be applied for stratification and follow-up of Chagas disease in the Amazon region.

AB  - Introduction: Studies on Chagas disease-related mortality assist in decision-making health policies. We analyzed the epidemiological characteristics, temporal trends, and regional differences in Chagas disease-related mortality in Colombia from 1979 to 2018. Methods: A time-series study was conducted using death records and population data from the National Administrative Department of Statistics, using categorizations from the International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 systems. All deaths with Chagas disease as an underlying or associated cause of death were included. Crude and age-sex standardized mortality rates per 100,000 inhabitants and the annual percent change (APC) were calculated. Results: Of the 7,287,461 deaths recorded in Colombia during 1979-2018, 3,276 (0.04%) deaths were related to Chagas disease-2,827 (86.3%) as an underlying cause and 449 (13.7%) as an associated cause. The average annual age-sex standardized mortality rate was 0.211 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.170-0.252) deaths/100,000 inhabitants, with a significant upward trend (APC = 6.60%; 95% CI: 5.9-7.3). The highest Chagas disease-related death rates were in males (0.284 deaths/100,000 inhabitants), those >= 65 years old (1.296 deaths/100,000 inhabitants), and residents of the Orinoco region (1.809 deaths/100,000 inhabitants). There was a significant increase in mortality in the Orinoco (APC = 8.28%; 95% CI: 6.4-10.2), Caribbean (APC = 5.06%; 95% CI: 3.6-6.5), and Andean (APC = 4.63%; 95% CI: 3.9-5.3) regions. Conclusions: Chagas disease remains a major public health issue in Colombia with high mortality rates in older age groups, a wide geographic distribution, regional differences, and the potential to increase.

AB  - The pathological processes resulting from parasitic infection are known to have important impacts on the mother child dyad during pregnancy. The roles of parasite transmission and the maternal immune response have been described in diseases such as malaria, toxoplasmosis, and trypanosomiasis. However, the impact of parasites of the genus Leishmania, etiological agents of the neglected tropical diseases tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is comparatively less well known, though it is an increasingly recognized concern for infected mothers and their fetuses. In this review, we first consider the pathophysiology of placental infection and transplacental transmission of this parasite, and then discuss the role and mechanisms of the maternal immune system in simultaneously mediating maternal-fetal infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - Several species of trypanosomes can infect bats (Chiroptera), but current information about bat trypanosomes in Colombia is scarce. The objectives of this study were to estimate the infection rate and to characterize the trypanosome species infecting bats from three rural regions near the municipality of Cumaribo in Vichada, Colombia. Blood samples were collected from 39 bats. DNA was extracted from the blood samples and analyzed using nuclear genetic markers (SSU rDNA, ITS rDNA, and cathepsin genes) to discriminate among trypanosome species. Trypanosomes were detected in 66.7 % (26/39) of blood samples using PCR; 61.5 % (24/39) of infections were identified as Trypanosoma theileri and 5.1 % (2/39) as T. wauwau-like parasites. The phylogeographic analysis revealed that our T. theileri sequences were associated with the TthIIB genotype from cattle in Brazil and Venezuela. The T. wauwau-like parasites represent a new genotype of the species and were found in Molossus molossus and Platyrrhinus helleri bats. These data represent the first evidence of this trypanosome in both Colombia, and in these species of bats. Bat infections with T. theileri suggest an important role of these hosts in maintaining this genotype, probably acquired by ingesting insect vectors. The T. wauwau-like genotype in new mammalian host species supports the 'bat seeding' hypothesis of the T. cruzi clade. The epidemiological and evolutionary implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Author summary The results demonstrate the ecological potential ofTriatoma brasiliensisin the northeastern caatinga and how this species uses the resources available in nature or in the modified environment by man. Triatomines were collected in peridomestic, sylvatic, and intradomicile habitats. House infestations were evaluated on five occasions, with spraying of infested houses.T.brasiliensiswas responsible for the high rates of dispersal, infestation, colonization andTrypanosoma cruziinfection in all catches and environments studied here. Spraying strongly reduced the infestation, but the number of triatomines rapidly returned to previous levels. Peridomicile represents a complex set of overlapping infested sites forming a network of shelters that favor the establishment and proliferation of triatomine colonies. Molecular characterization ofT.cruziisolated from triatomines and identification of their food sources emphasize the overlap of habitats and interaction among triatomines, synanthropic reservoirs and humans, increasing the risk of parasite transmission. Therefore, it is clear the need for maintenance of vector control fully and systematically with the use of appropriate strategies where interventions should consider regional ecoepidemiologic differences and the influence of environmental, socioeconomic and cultural factors inT.cruzytransmission process into domicile environment.
   The northeastern semiarid region stands out in the Brazilian context regarding the eco-epidemiology of Chagas disease, in whichTriatoma brasiliensisis the main vector ofTrypanosoma cruzi. Persistent house invasion threatens the relative levels of progress achieved over previous decades. We conducted an intervention trial with a five-year follow-up to assess the impacts of residual spraying with pyrethroid insecticides on house infestation withT.brasiliensisin 18 rural villages (242 houses) located in the Taua, Ceara. House infestations were assessed by systematic manual searches for triatomines in every domestic and peridomestic habitat on five occasions. Triatomines were collected in peridomestic (57.5%), sylvatic (35.8%), and intradomiciliary (6.7%) habitats. The most important ecotopes ofT.brasiliensiswere containing roofing tiles, bricks or rocks (23.4% +/- 9.1). Residual insecticide spraying substantially reduced baseline house infestation rates from 27.9% to 5.9% by 6 months post first spraying (MPS). The decline was substantially greater in intradomiciles (11.2% to 0.8%) than in peridomiciles (16.7% to 5%). The mean relative density of triatomines recovered its preintervention values at 14 MPS in intradomiciles, and in the main peridomestic ecotopes. The house infestation levels recorded at 14 MPS persisted thereafter despite all reinfested houses were selectively sprayed on every occasion. Overall average bug infection rates withT.cruziin the five occasions were in intradomiciles (11.1%), peridomiciles (4.7%) and wild habitats (3.3%). In peridomicileT.cruziinfection rates decreased significantly at all stages after chemical intervention. In intradomicile, the only significant difference occurred at 20 MPS (7.7% to 30.8%). The vectorial capacity ofT.brasiliensis, combined with its invasive potential from sylvatic sources and the limited effectiveness of chemical control in the harshcaatingalandscape, pose serious obstacles to the definite elimination of domestic transmission risks. Systematic vector surveillance supported by community participation and locally adapted environmental management measures are needed to reduce the risks of establishment of domestic transmission withT.cruziin this region.

AB  - Simple Summary Triatomines are vector insects capable of transmitting the protozoan that causes Chagas disease, thus representing a health risk in several countries, especially in Central and South America. Triatoma brasiliensis brasiliensis, the main triatomine vector in northeastern Brazil, needs frequent monitoring as it is able to colonize various natural and artificial ecotopes as well as to infest domiciles. This research uses geometric morphometrics as a tool to evaluate changes in the morphology and analyze a large temporal dataset of 102 years of collections of T. b. brasiliensis. Finding novelty results which indicate a morphological stasis in the morphology. Triatoma brasiliensis brasiliensis Neiva, 1911 is one of the most important vectors of Chagas disease in the Brazilian semiarid regions in the north-east. The risk imposed by T. b. brasiliensis to the human populations, due to frequent invasions and/or colonization of the domiciles, demands constant monitoring and control actions as well as an understanding of its evolutionary process. In this context, the following research studies the pattern of shape adaptation over time using a large dataset from 102 years of specimen collections in order to identify the morphological plasticity of this vector in Brazil. This dataset was analyzed using geometric morphometrics tools and the timescale was divided into eight different groups, containing specimens from 1912 to 2014. Geometric morphometrics analysis showed an interesting morphological stasis in the wing shape of T. b. brasiliensis, which allowed us to understand the high capacity of adaptation to changes in climate condition through time, and the invasive status which Triatoma species have around the world. Moreover, these results showed novel findings as an interesting phenotypic pattern, with no modifications in more than 100 years, leading us to understand the shape evolution in Triatominae as a vector species of diseases.

AB  - Background
   Rhodnius nasutus, a vector of the etiological agent Trypanosoma cruzi, is one of the epidemiologically most relevant triatomine species of the Brazilian Caatinga, where it often colonizes rural peridomestic structures such as chicken coops and occasionally invades houses. Historical colonization and determination of its genetic diversity and population structure may provide new information towards the improvement of vector control in the region. In this paper we present thoughtful analyses considering the phylogeography and demographic history of R. nasutus in the Caatinga.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   A total of 157 R. nasutus specimens were collected from Copernicia prunifera palm trees in eight geographic localities within the Brazilian Caatinga biome, sequenced for 595-bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cyt b) and genotyped for eight microsatellite loci. Sixteen hap lotypes were detected in the cyt b sequences, two of which were shared between different localities. Molecular diversity indices exhibited low diversity and a haplotype network revealed low divergence among R. nasutus sequences, with two central haplotypes shared by five of the eight populations analyzed. The demographic model that better represented R. nasutus population dynamics was the exponential growth model. Results of the microsatellite data analyses indicated that the entire population is comprised of four highly differentiated groups, with no obvious contemporary geographic barriers that could explain the population substructure detected. A complex pattern of migration was observed, in which a western Caatinga population seems to be the source of emigrants to the eastern populations.
   Conclusions/Significance
   R. nasutus that inhabit C. prunifera palms do not comprise a species complex. The species went through a population expansion at 12-10 ka, during the Holocene, which coincides with end of the largest dry season in South America. It colonized the Caatinga in a process that occurred from west to east in the region. R. nasutus is presently facing an important ecological impact caused by the continuous deforestation of C. prunifera palms in northeast Brazil. We hypothesize that this ecological disturbance might contribute to an increase in the events of invasion and colonization of human habitations.

AB  - Leishmania spp. is a protozoan that maintains its life cycle in domestic and wild animals and it may include bats, a population that has increased in urban environments. This study aimed to investigate the presence of Leishmania spp. in bats captured strictly in urban areas that are endemic for visceral leishmaniasis. The spleen and skin samples of 488 bats from 21 endemic cities in northwestern sao Paulo State, Brazil, were tested for the presence of Leishmania kDNA using real-time PCR. Differentiation from Trypanosoma spp. was achieved by amplifying a DNA fragment of the ribosomal RNA gene. The presence of Leishmania spp. kDNA was verified in 23.9% of bats and Trypanosoma spp. DNA was identified in 3.9%. Leishmania species differentiation revealed the presence of Leishmania amazonensis in 78.3% of the bats; L. infantum in 17.4%, and 1 sample (4.3%) showed a mix pattern of L. infantum and L amazonensis. We also detected, for the first time, L infantum and L. amazonensis DNA in Desmodus rotundus, the hematophagous bat. The presence of Leishmania spp. DNA in bats strictly from urban areas endemic for visceral leishmaniasis in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil indicates that these wild and abundant animals are capable of harboring Leishmania spp. in this new scenario. Due to their longevity, high dispersion capacity and adaptability to synanthropic environments, they may play a role in the maintenance of the life cycle of Leishmania parasites.

AB  - Background: The effects of exercise training on Chagas heart disease are still unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of exercise training over functional capacity, cardiac function, quality of life, and biomarkers in Chagas heart disease.
   Methods: The PEACH study is a superiority randomized clinical trial which will include subjects who meet the following criteria: Chagas heart disease with a left ventricular ejection fraction below 45 % with or without heart failure symptoms; clinical stability in the last 3 months; adherence to clinical treatment; and age above 18 years. The exclusion criteria are: pregnancy; neuromuscular limitations; smoking; evidence of non-chagasic heart disease; systemic conditions that limit exercise practice or cardiopulmonary exercise test; unavailability to attend the center three times a week during the intervention period; and practitioners of regular exercise. The intervention group will perform an exercise training intervention three times per week during 6 months and will be compared to the control group without exercise. Both groups will undergo the same monthly pharmaceutical and nutritional counseling as well as standard medical treatment according to the Brazilian consensus on Chagas disease. The primary outcome is functional capacity based on peak exercise oxygen consumption during cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Secondary outcomes are: cardiac function; body composition; muscle respiratory strength; microvascular reactivity; cardiac rhythm abnormalities; autonomic function; biochemical; oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers; and quality of life. Subjects will be evaluated at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months after randomization. Thirty patients will be randomly assigned into exercise or control groups at a ratio of 1:1.
   Discussion: Findings of the present study will be useful to determine if physical exercise programs should be included as an important additional therapy in the treatment of patients with Chagas heart disease.

AB  - Trypanosome is considered as one of important parasites in almost all mammalian species, which occurs in Chiroptera throughout the world. Although numerous trypanosome species have been identified in bats in Asia, Africa, South America and Europe, little is known about the genetic diversity and pathogenicity of trypanosomes in Chinese bat. Recently, some human Trypanosoma cruzi infection attributed to a bat-related T. cruzi (TcBat) from the Noctilio spp., Myotis spp. and Artibeus spp was found. Consequently, it is a necessity to know trypanosome species in bats from China.
   In order to determine the prevalence and genotypes in bat from southwestern China, wehere detected trypanosomes prevalence 227bat brain tissue samples, including 60 Rousettus leschenaultia, 58 Hipposideros Pomona, 69 Rhinolophus pusillus, 40 Myotis daubentonni in Yunnan Province of China using nested PCR based on 18S rRNA. 14 (6.2%) of them were trypanosmes positive including 13 insect-eating bats and 1 fruit bat. The prevalence of trypanosome in R.leschenaultia, H. Pomona, and R.pusillus was 1.67%(1/60), 6.90%(4/58) and 13.0%(9/69), respectively (P < 0.01), suggesting R. pusillus was a main-vector host bat. The positive rate of T.sp, T. dionisii, T.brucei brucei and T.sp ZY-2 was 4.8% (11/227), 0.4%(1/227), 0.4%(1/227), and 0.4% (1/227), resepectively. These results showed that T.sp-Yunnan is the predominant genospecies. To our knowledge, this is the first report about Trypanosome species in bats in Yunnan Province, southwestern China.

Methods: We analyzed phenotypic (connexivum color patterns, wing morphometrics) and genetic variation (16S mtDNA) of three Brazilian T. costalimai populations. We compared 16S sequences with those of putative Bolivian T. costalimai and its sister species, T. jatai. Results: Brazilian populations had different connexivum color patterns and forewing shapes. A 16S mtDNA haplotype network showed a clear separation of Brazilian T. costalimai from both T. jatai and Bolivian T. costalimai. Conclusions: We report considerable variability in T. costalimai populations.

AB  - Community participation is the main strategy to sustainability of Chagas disease entomological surveillance. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of knowledge on triatomine insects and Chagas disease among the residents from eight localities of Diamantina, in Minas Gerais, with a view to observing any associations between their knowledge and infestations by triatomines. In order to evaluate this knowledge, questionnaires were used containing both closed and open questions. They were applied to 583 residents who were ten years old or over. To establish if they could recognize the triatomine insect, they were given samples to look at. The responses to the closed questions were analyzed with reference to any frequencies of and associations with infestations involving this insect. The responses to the questions were organized into different thematic areas and were descriptively analyzed. Although the resident's ability to recognize the triatomine insect was not associated with the infestation of the localities, the residents in the areas that had higher infestations showed that they had a good knowledge of the available support services and the need to send the insects to them. We did not observe any associations between triatomine infestations and knowledge of Chagas disease. The results of this study can provide guidance on education that can be given by the health services to the community in order to encourage them to provide notifications of the triatomine insects.

AB  - Background: Neglected Tropical Diseases are a set of communicable diseases that affect the population so low socioeconomic status, particularly 1.4 billion people who are living below the poverty level. This study has investigated the magnitude and mortality time trends for these diseases in the state of Sergipe, Northeast Region of Brazil.
   Methods: We conducted an ecological study of time series, based on secondary data derived from the Mortality Information System of the Ministry of Health. The mortality rates (crude, age-standardized rates and proportional ratio) were calculated from the deaths due to Neglected Tropical Diseases in the state of Sergipe, from 1980 to 2013. The time trends were obtained using the Joinpoint regression model.
   Results: Three hundred six thousand and eight hundred seventy-two deaths were certified in the state and Neglected Tropical Diseases were mentioned as the underlying cause in 1,203 certificates (0.39%). Mean number of deaths was 35.38 per year, and crude and age-standardized mortality rates were, respectively: 2.16 per 100 000 inhabitants (95% CI: 1.45-2.87) and 2.87 per 100 000 inhabitants (95% CI: 1.93-3.82); the proportional mortality ratio was 0.41% (95% CI: 0.27-0.54). In that period, Schistosomiasis caused 654 deaths (54.36%), followed by Chagas disease, with 211 (17.54%), and by Leishmaniases, with 142 (11.80%) deaths. The other diseases totalized 196 deaths (16.30%). There were increasing mortality trends for Neglected Tropical Diseases, Schistosomiasis and Chagas disease in the last 15 years, according to the age-standardized rates, and stability of the mortality trends for Leishmaniases.
   Conclusions: The Neglected Tropical Diseases show increasing trends and are a real public health problem in the state of Sergipe, since they are responsible for significant mortality rates. The following diseases call attention for showing greater number of deaths in the period of study: Schistosomiasis, Chagas disease and Leishmaniases. We finally suggest that public managers take appropriate actions to develop new strategies in epidemiological and therapeutic surveillance, and in the follow-up of these patients.

AB  - Background: The search for new drug compounds is always challenging and there are several different strategies that involve the most varied and creative approaches in medicinal chemistry. One of them is the technique of molecular hybridisation: forming a hybrid compound from two or more pharmacophoric subunits. These hybrids may maintain the characteristics of the original compound and preferably show improvements to its pharmacological action, with reduced side effects and lower toxicity when compared to the original components. This study specifically focuses on synthesising hybrid molecules which demonstrate trypanocidal activity against the epimastigote and trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Methods: In this context, this study centres on the synthesis of a novel structural scaffold via molecular hybridisation; by using a triazole species to link a metronidazole unit to a eugenol analogue unit, the objective being to combine their therapeutic properties into a new molecular structure. The resulting hybrid molecules were evaluated against T cruzi which is responsible for high incidences of trypanosomiasis in tropical countries such as Brazil. Results: The results of this study showed an improvement in the anti-parasitic activity of the hybrid compounds with the best result coming from hybrid compounds [8] and [9], which present an activity similar to the control drug benznidazole. The new compounds, utilising a triazole species as a coupling connector, demonstrated promising results and has highlighted the path for planning similar structural patterns to investigate new compounds. Conclusions: In summary, we can conclude that the synthesised hybrid compounds demonstrate that using a triazole to link metronidazole with natural phenols, produces hybrid molecules that are promising as a new class of compounds of therapeutic interest for further investigation.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is an endemic disease present in 98 countries. In Brazil, the northeast region accounts for approximately half of the cases in humans, and has experienced an increased number of positive cases in dogs. In this study, we investigated the epidemiology of canine leishmaniasis in the city of Ilheus, Bahia, using serological and molecular techniques and evaluated the possible environmental risk factors and associated clinical signs. Blood samples were collected from 560 dogs in urban and peri-urban areas in Ilheus, northeastern Brazil. Genomic DNA was extracted from the selected animals and subjected to molecular analysis using Leishmania species-specific primers and diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi. A total of 54.72% of dogs were positive for Leishmania braziliensis, and animals positive for both Leishmania infantum and T. cruzi were not identified. Hematologic variables were not statistically associated with cases of L. braziliensis. However, the positive animal group showed lower red blood cell and platelet counts and higher levels of urea and serum creatinine. Few dogs presented clinical signs compatible with the presence of Leishmania. Age of more than 2 years and specific hair colors were associated with positive results for L. braziliensis. The geoclimatic characteristics of the region may improve parasite survival, reproduction, and vectors. This may explain the higher rate of dogs identified as positive in this study.

AB  - In semi-arid areas of northeastern Brazil, Chagas disease vectors of Triatoma brasiliensis species complex comprise a monophyletic group of kissing bugs that inhabit rock outcrops. Most of them exhibit allopatric or parapatric distribution; the exception is T. petrocchiae, which is found in cohabitation with T. brasiliensis in rock outcrops. We used vertebrate mitochondrial gene sequencing applied to DNA isolated from bug midgut to identify the insect blood meal sources via BLAST procedure. Fourteen sylvatic insects from four geographic districts in the states of Rio Grande do Norte and Paraiba had their blood meal sources detected. While T. brasiliensis is recorded to be associated mainly (52-71%) with rodents, T. petrocchiae samples were strongly associated (86%) with reptiles of Tropidurus and Hemidactylus genera. We suggest that T. petrocchiae is the single member within this complex to be associated with reptiles, indicating a distinct niche occupation related to the trophic resources.

AB  - In Brazil, the Trypanosoma sp. 858 was isolated from a toad (Anura: Bufonidae: Rhinella ictericus) and successfully maintained in cultures. We previously demonstrated that this trypanosome is different but tightly clustered phylogenetically with other trypanosomes from anurans. In this study, we addressed the ultrastructural features of cultured epimastigotes of this new trypanosome. Our results showed very long and thin free motile forms exhibiting a long flagellum and remarkable large and loose K-DNA network. In addition, the anterior portion contained many acidocalcisomes and a well-developed spongiome tubules-contractile vacuole system. One of the main morphological features of this anuran trypanosome was the presence of a complex cytostome-cytopharynx with a specialized membrane coating at the entrance, which is often hidden by the flagellum. Other conspicuous features are the presence of lipid-like droplets, lamellar membrane limited inclusions, and one very large reservosome, all at the posterior portion of the cell body. This new trypanosome may constitute an excellent model for organelles studies related to endocytosis and lipid storage, as demonstrated herein using scanning and transmission electron microscopy and three-dimensional models obtained by either electron microscopy tomography or dual-beam slice and view series.

AB  - Chagas disease is one of the most important insect-vectored diseases in Brazil. The entomopathogenic fungusMetarhizium anisopliaewas evaluated against nymphs and adults ofPanstrongylus megistus, Triatoma infestans, andT. sordida. Pathogenicity tests at saturated humidity demonstrated high susceptibility to fungal infection. The shortest estimates of 50% lethal time (LT50) forP. megistusvaried from 4.6 (isolate E9) to 4.8 days (genetically modified strain 157p). ForT. infestans, the shortest LT(50)was 6.3 (E9) and 7.3 days (157p). ForT. sordida, the shortest LT(50)was 8.0 days (157p). The lethal concentration sufficient to kill 50% ofT. infestans(LC50) was 1.9 x 10(7)conidia/ml for strain 157p. In three chicken coops that were sprayed withM. anisopliae, nymphs especially were well controlled, with a great population reduction of 38.5% after 17 days. ThereforeM. anisopliaeperformed well, controlling Triatominae in both laboratory and field studies.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the quality of life (QoL) of patients with Chagas disease (CD) and the association between QoL domains and several clinical, socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics of this population. Methods Results Cross-sectional observational study conducted from March 2014 to March 2017 including a total of 361 outpatients followed at Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Disease, Brazil. QoL was assessed using the Portuguese shorter version of the original WHO Quality of Life questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF). Information about clinical CD presentation, presence of comorbidities, functional class, previous benznidazole treatment, socioeconomic profile and lifestyle was also obtained. Environment and physical domains presented the worst QoL scores, while the social relationship domain presented the highest score. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that variables independently associated with QoL were functional class, sex, clinical presentation of CD, sleep duration, schooling, physical activity level, smoking, income per capita and residents by domicile. Conclusions Objectifs The low socioeconomic status and the physical limitations imposed by the disease presented an important impact on the QoL reduction among CD patients, especially on environment and physical domains. Strategies to improve QoL among CD patients should be tailored and consider many different variables to maximise improvements not only of patients' physical but also of their mental health.

AB  - Background Dogs are considered sentinels in areas of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission risk to humans. ELISA is generally the method of choice for diagnosing T. cruzi exposure in dogs, but its performance substantially depends on the antigenic matrix employed. In previous studies, our group has developed four chimeric antigens (IBMP-8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4) and evaluated their potential for diagnosing T. cruzi exposure in humans. For human sera, these chimeric antigens presented superior diagnostic performances as compared to commercial tests available in Brazil, Spain, and Argentina. Therefore, in this study we have evaluated the potential of these antigenic proteins for detection of anti-T. cruzi IgG antibodies in dog sera.
   Methodology/Principal findings The IBMP-ELISA assays were optimized by checkerboard titration. Subsequently, the diagnostic potential was validated through analysis of ROC curves and the performance of the tests was determined using double entry tables. Cross-reactivity was also evaluated for babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, dirofilariosis, anaplasmosis, and visceral leishmaniosis. Best performance was shown by IBMP-8.3 and IBMP-8.4, although all four antigens demonstrated a high diagnostic performance with 46 positive and 149 negative samples tested. IBMP-8.3 demonstrated 100% sensitivity, followed by IBMP-8.4 (96.7-100%), IBMP-8.2 (73.3-87.5%), and IBMP-8.1 (50-100%). The highest specificities were achieved with IBMP-8.2 (100%) and IBMP-8.4 (100%), followed by IBMP-8.3 (96.7-97.5%) and IBMP 8.1 (89.1-100%).
   Conclusions/Significance The use of chimeric antigenic matrices in immunoassays for anti-T. cruzi IgG antibody detection in sera of infected dogs was shown to be a promising tool for veterinary diagnosis and epidemiological studies. The chimeric antigens used in this work allowed also to overcome the common hurdles related to serodiagnosis of T. cruzi infection, especially regarding variation of efficiency parameters according to different strains and cross-reactivity with other infectious diseases.
   Author summary Despite dogs being considered T. cruzi's most important domestic sentinel/reservoir and also suffering from the outcomes of the infection, there has never been a commercially available test to diagnose T. cruzi infection in dogs. As such, our group's objective was to develop a state-of-the-art serological diagnostic test utilizing four chimeric antigens (IBMP-8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4) in an ELISA platform to accurately identify canine anti-T. cruzi IgG antibodies. The IBMP-ELISA assays were optimized, evaluated for cross-reactivity towards multiple canine parasite's, including Leishmania spp., its diagnostic potential was validated and the test's performance was determined using double entry tables. The IBMP-8.3 antigen demonstrated 100% sensitivity, followed by IBMP-8.4, whereas the highest specificities were achieved with IBMP-8.2 (100%) and IBMP-8.4 (100%). Therefore, we've concluded that the serodiagnosis through anti-T. cruzi IgG detection in dogs, utilizing chimeric antigenic matrices in immunoassays is a promising tool for veterinary diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance. Furthermore, the use of chimeric antigens efficiently addressed common hurdles related to T. cruzi serodiagnosis, especially regarding efficiency variation in response to different strains and cross-reactivity.

AB  - Wild animals have been recognized as potential reservoirs of vector-borne pathogens. Proximity between these animals and urban areas increases the need to know which pathogens these are and whether they can infect domestic animals and humans. In Mangabeiras Municipal Park in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, coatis live near the urban area, which is mainly occupied by human residents and their domestic animals. Therefore, the objective of this study was to detect, through molecular and direct methods, the presence of ectoparasites and hemoparasites in coatis. A total of 216 samples were collected, of which 209 samples were from first-captures and seven were from recaptures. The following parasites were found: ticks of the genus Amblyomma, lice of the species Neotrichodectes pallidus and fleas of the species Rhopalopsyllus Iutzi Iutzi and Ctenocephalides felis felis. All the samples were negative for the family Anaplasmataceae and the species Leishmania sp. and Trypanosoma cruzi. The hemoparasites Trypanosoma evansi, Hepatozoon procyonis, Babesia sp. and Sarcocystis neuron were found. The area of the present study is not endemic for T. evansi, which therefore suggests that these coatis may be acting as reservoirs or sentinels of this parasite. This finding is of great epidemiological importance and should be investigated more closely. Thus, this study showed that there is a great variety of pathogens in the park that transit among coatis and, probably, among other animals that inhabit or live close to the park.

AB  - Objectives To assess the correlation between the burden of seven priority neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) included in the Brazilian National Agenda of Priorities in Health Research - tuberculosis, Chagas disease, leprosy, malaria, leishmaniasis, dengue and schistosomiasis - and their respective research funding and output. Methods This retrospective review obtained data on disease burden from the Global Burden of Disease Study and funding data from open access sources. Publications were retrieved from Scopus and SciELO, and characterised according to the type of research conducted. Correlation between funding, research output and burden was assessed by comparing the 'expected' and 'observed' values for funding and publications relative to the proportional burden for each disease. Results There was an emphasis in basic biomedical research (average 30% of publications) and a shortage of health policy and systems (average 7%) and social sciences research (average 3%). Research output and funding were poorly correlated with disease burden. Tuberculosis, Chagas disease and schistosomiasis accounted for more than 75% of total NTD-related DALYs, but accounted for only 34% of publications. Leprosy, leishmaniasis and malaria, together, received 49% of NTD-related funding despite being responsible for only 9% of DALYs. Conclusions The analysis evidenced a lack of correlation between disease burden, research output and government funding for priority NTDs in Brazil. Our findings highlight the importance of monitoring health needs, research investments and outputs to inform policy and optimise the uptake of evidence for action, particularly in developing countries, where resources are scarce and the research capacity is limited. The results contribute to health policy by highlighting the need for improving coordination of scientific activities and public health needs for effective impact.

AB  - Background
   Risk stratification of Chagas disease patients in the limited-resource setting would be helpful in crafting management strategies. We developed a score to predict 2-year mortality in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy from remote endemic areas.
   Methods and Results
   This study enrolled 1551 patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy from Minas Gerais State, Brazil, from the SaMi-Trop cohort (The Sao Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical Medicine Research Center). Clinical evaluation, ECG, and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) were performed. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to develop a prediction model based on the key predictors. The end point was all-cause mortality. The patients were classified into 3 risk categories at baseline (low, <2%; intermediate, >= 2% to 10%; high, >= 10%). External validation was performed by applying the score to an independent population with Chagas disease. After 2 years of follow-up, 110 patients died, with an overall mortality rate of 3.505 deaths per 100 person-years. Based on the nomogram, the independent predictors of mortality were assigned points: age (10 points per decade), New York Heart Association functional class higher than I (15 points), heart rate >= 80 beats/min (20 points), QRS duration >= 150 ms (15 points), and abnormal NT-proBNP adjusted by age (55 points). The observed mortality rates in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups were 0%, 3.6%, and 32.7%, respectively, in the derivation cohort and 3.2%, 8.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in the validation cohort. The discrimination of the score was good in the development cohort (C statistic: 0.82), and validation cohort (C statistic: 0.71).
   Conclusions
   In a large population of patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy, a combination of risk factors accurately predicted early mortality. This helpful simple score could be used in remote areas with limited technological resources.

AB  - We described the phylogenetic affiliation, development in cultures and ultrastructural features of a trypanosome of Leptodacylus chaquensis from the Pantanal biome of Brazil. In the inferred phylogeny, this trypanosome nested into the Anura clade of the basal Aquatic clade of Trypanosoma, but was separate from all known species within this clade. This finding enabled us to describe it as Trypanosoma herthameyeri n. sp., which also infects other Leptodacylus species from the Pantanal and Caatinga biomes. Trypanosoma herthameyeri multiplies as small rounded forms clumped together and evolving into multiple-fission forms and rosettes of epimastigotes released as long forms with long flagella; scarce trypomastigotes and glove-like forms are common in stationary-phase cultures. For the first time, a trypanosome from an amphibian was observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy, revealing a cytostome opening, well-developed flagellar lamella, and many grooves in pumpkin-like forms. Transmission electron microscopy showed highly developed Golgi complexes, relaxed catenation of KDNA, and a rich set of spongiome tubules in a regular parallel arrangement to the flagellar pocket as confirmed by electron tomography. Considering the basal position in the phylogenetic tree, developmental and ultrastructural data of T. herthameyeri are valuable for evolutionary studies of trypanosome architecture and cell biology.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is still a neglected disease. Infected individuals are diagnosed late, being treated in worse clinical conditions. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the prevalence and the factors associated with new confirmed cases of CD identified by serological screening in an endemic region of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. This is an analytical crosssectional study with data from a project of the Research Center in Tropical Medicine of Sao Paulo- Minas Gerais (SaMi-Trop) conducted in two municipalities. Data collection included a questionnaire with closed questions, a venous blood collection and an ELISA serological test for CD. A total of 2,038 individuals with no previous diagnosis of CD participated in the study. The result of the serological test for CD was adopted as the dependent variable. The independent variables addressed personal issues, health conditions and lifetime housing. A descriptive analysis of individual variables was performed. Subsequently, a bivariate analysis was performed using the Pearson's chi-square test. Households sheltering individuals positive for CD were georeferenced, and the analysis of spatial distribution was performed using the quartic function to estimate the density of the nucleus. Among the participants, 188 (9.2 %) were positive for CD. The profile of participants with CD was associated with place of residence, age, relative/family member with CD and living conditions. It is noteworthy that there are still patients with CD who are unaware of their diagnosis in both, rural and urban areas.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare pulmonary function among patients with different clinical forms and scores for risk of death and stroke. Patients were recruited from the Chagas Disease Ambulatory Service at the University of Rio Grande do Norte State (Mossoro, Brazil). The evaluation of pulmonary function was performed through spirometry techniques using a digital spirometer, and information about the clinical forms (cardiac, cardiodigestive, digestive and undetermined) and scores for risk of death (Rassi's risk-of-death score) and stroke was subsequently collected. Upon completion of the evaluation, comparisons of the values obtained between the groups for different clinical forms, risk stratification of stroke and Rassi's risk-of-death were made. The study cohort consisted of 72 patients. Individuals with a low risk of death had significantly higher values in the Tiffeneau index and individuals with a low risk of stroke presented with higher percentage values for forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in 1 sec. In addition, individuals with heart disease had worse percentage values for FVC and FEV1. In conclusion, the results showed that spirometry was an effective analytical technique and was associated with clinical forms, and death and stroke risk scores, in patients with Chagas disease, adding an important prognostic tool to those currently available.

AB  - This study aimed to describe the spatial distribution and assess entomological indicators of synanthropic triatomines in Piaui State, Northeastern Brazil. We used surveillance data on the detection, identification and assessment of natural infection with trypanosomatids from triatomines in the State from 2014 to 2017. The State was divided into four macroregions. In relation to the dispersion rates of triatomines, they were much lower in the North, when compared to Southwest, Southeast and Central North macroregions. Infestation rates were higher in the Southwest and Southeast and intradomicile infestation rates varied during the study period, reaching high values in all regions. Insects belonging to the species Triatoma brasiliensis complex. Triatoma pseudomaculata, Triatoma sordida, and to the genus Panstrongylus spp. and Rhodnius spp. were collected during this period. T. brasiliensis was collected from all four regions of the State, but more frequently in those located in the Southeast. A similar pattern was observed for T. pseudomaculata. T. sordida was detected in the municipalities in the Southeast and Southwest regions, and less frequently in the Central North municipalities. Rhodnius spp. was detected in the Central North and North regions, and Panstrongylus spp. in the Central North and Southeast regions. The highest trypanosomatid-positivity rate of T. brasiliensis and Panstrongylus spp. was in the Southeast region. A significant proportion of the municipalities of Piaui State presents entomological parameters that indicate a risk of Chagas disease by vector transmission.

AB  - Introduction: We aimed to describe the sociodemographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of patients with chronic Chagas disease (CD) at an infectious disease referral center. Changes in patient profiles over time were also evaluated. Methods: This retrospective study included patients with CD from November 1986-December 2019. All patients underwent an evaluation protocol that included sociodemographic profile; epidemiological history; anamnesis; and physical, cardiologic, and digestive examinations. Trend differences for each 5-year period from 1986 to 2019 were tested using a nonparametric trend test for continuous and generalized linear models with binomial distribution for categorical variables. Results: A total of 2,168 patients (52.2% women) were included, with a mean age of 47.8 years old. White patients with low levels of education predominated. The reported transmission mode was vectorial in 90.2% of cases. The majority came from areas with a high prevalence (52.2%) and morbidity (67.8%) of CD. The most common clinical presentation was the indeterminate form (44.9%). The number of patients referred gradually decreased and the age at admission increased during the study period, as did the patients' levels of education. Conclusions: The clinical profile of CD is characterized by a predominance of the indeterminate form of the disease. Regarding the patients who were followed up at the referral center, there was a progressive increase in the mean age and a concomitant decrease in the number of new patients. This reflects the successful control of vector and transfusion transmission in Brazil as well as the aging population of patients with CD.

Methods: In 2002, a male specimen of P. tertius was collected in the municipality of Porto Rico, Parana, Brazil. Results: This finding adds to the data on the geographical distribution of P. tertius from 14 to 15 known occurrences in Brazilian states and, therefore, reports the increase in the diversity of triatomines in Parana. Conclusions: The presence of P. tertius in the state of Parana demonstrates that the biodiversity of these insects may have been underestimated.

AB  - Chagas disease affects approximately 10 million people in South America and 1.5 million in Argentina. Congenital transmission is most important in urban areas. There are two drugs approved for treatment: nifurtimox (Bayer) and benznidazole (BNZ) (Roche, LAFEPE, Elea), developed more than 40 years ago. Their pharmacology and metabolism in humans have been seldom studied. The information available on children and pregnant women is virtually non-existent. The aim of this study is to provide systematic studies towards a rational pharmacotherapeutic sin children, which has been empirically proven to be highly effective. Bioanalytical methods were developed for plasma, urine and breast milk for parent drugs and for the identification of their metabolites in samples of patients under treatment. The pediatric population pharmacokinetics described here for BNZ is conclusive about their differences from adult pharmacokinetics. Three compounds presented as BNZ metabolites were identified. The transfer of this drug to the breast milk does not present a risk to the infant. These evidences offer information to improve the existing treatment protocols, seeking a pharmacotherapy adapted to the age and a safer use of the drugs in children and eventually in adults.

AB  - Background-Patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC) have high mortality, and CC is a common indication for heart transplantation (HTx) in endemic countries. Chagas disease reactivation (CDR) is common after transplantation and is likely to cause adverse outcomes unless detected and treated appropriately. This study reviews our experiences with HTx among patients with CC, and the use of benznidazole (BZ) before transplantation. Methods-During the 18-year period from 1996 through 2014, 70 of 353 patients who underwent HTx (19.8%) had CC, and 53 patients met the inclusion criteria. The effectiveness of prophylactic treatment with BZ (dose of 5 mg/kg/day, two times per day, for at least four weeks and for a maximum of eight weeks) was determined based on the observed reduction in the incidence of CDR during the post-HTx period. Results-Prophylactic therapy was administered to 18/53 patients (34.0%). During the follow-up period, the incidence rate of CDR in our study was 34.0% (18/53). Based on logistic regression analysis, only prophylaxis (OR = 0.12; CI 0.02-0.76;p= 0.025) was considered to protect against CDR. Conclusion-Our study suggests that the use of BZ may reduce the incidence of CDR in patients undergoing HTx and warrants further investigation in a prospective, randomized trial.

AB  - Introduction: Implementation of prevention and control measures for communicable diseases in border regions can be challenging and lead to inefficient attempts to control them. We describe evidences on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges regarding implementation of health interventions for control, prevention and treatment of selected neglected tropical diseases (NTD), a group of transmissible diseases typically prevalent in tropical countries and vulnerable populations, in the tri-border between Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. Methodology: A systematic literature review of observational and experimental studies was conducted, using PubMed and Bireme databases. Eligibility criteria were location (tri-border area) and subject (health interventions). Results: Of a total of 595 references identified, 34 studies were included (18 pertaining to leishmaniasis, 11 to dengue, 2 to leprosy, 2 to soil transmitted helminthiases and 1 to Chagas' disease), with an inclusion rate of 6.4%. The main strengths were the similarity of health interventions between countries and easiness of mobility and communication flows. The main weaknesses were access to rural areas and discrepancies in the number of studies between countries. As for opportunities, we identified increased tourism, economic development and recent increasing research in this field. The main challenges were the absence of studies regarding other prevalent NTD in the region and movement of goods, animals and people across borders. Conclusions: Although epidemiological studies are still needed to better understand and assess the prevalence of NTD in the area, mainly in Paraguay, these findings can inform decision-makers and health managers to plan a common strategy to address NTD.

AB  - Neglected tropical diseases constitute a heterogeneous group of diseases that have as a common characteristic to affect poor and unassisted populations with little vocalization capacity and political power. As a result, they receive little attention from the pharmaceutical industry and academia. The present study aimed to summarize the state of the art regarding vaccine development for three relevant neglected tropical diseases in Brazil: Chagas disease, schistosomiasis (Schistosoma mansoni), and leishmaniasis. To this end, we conducted a narrative review of the scientific literature, including publications that allowed us to outline a current overview on the vaccine development for the three diseases. Vaccines against the three diseases are in different stages of development. Vaccine development projects against American trypanosomiasis have yet to reach the clinical evaluation phase. For schistosomiasis, we have candidates for the vaccine in the advanced phase of clinical evaluation. For leishmaniasis, there are already licensed veterinary vaccines, and product candidates for human vaccine in the intermediate stage of clinical evaluation. The reduced funding for these projects has contributed to slow product development.

AB  - In this article, we comment on the main features of infectious diseases in Brazil in the last 50 years, highlighting how much of this path Revista de Saude Publica could portray. From 1967 to 2016, 1,335 articles focusing on infectious diseases were published in Revista de Saude Publica. Although the proportion of articles on the topic have decreased from about 50.0% to 15.0%, its notability remained and reflected the growing complexity of the research required for its control. It is noteworthy that studies design and analysis strategies progressively became more sophisticated, following the great development of epidemiology in Brazil in the recent decades. Thus, the journal has followed the success of public health interventions that permitted to control or eliminate numerous infectious diseases - which were responsible, in the past, for high rates of morbidity and mortality -, and also followed the reemergence of diseases already controlled and the emergence of until then unknown diseases, with a strong impact on the Brazilian population, establishing a little predictable and very challenging path.

In this study, we used an experimental murine model of chronic infection with T. cruzi to evaluate the changes in the expression of inhibitory receptors and the polyfunctionality of T cells during gestation and their association with congenital transmission rate of T. cruzi infection. The results showed that pregnant naive mice had a higher percentage of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells that expressed inhibitory receptors than cells from non-pregnant naive mice. However, in mice chronically infected with T. cruzi, gestation induced a significant decrease in the frequency of T cells that expressed or co-expressed inhibitory receptors, as well as an increase in the frequency of polyfunctional CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. This different behavior may be due to the breakdown in the infected mice of the gestation-induced immune homeostasis, probably to control the parasite load. Remarkably, it was observed that the mothers that transmitted the parasite had a higher frequency of T cells that expressed and co-expressed inhibitory receptors as well as a lower frequency of polyfunctional parasite-specific T cells than those that did not transmit it, even though the parasitemia load was similar in both groups. All together these data suggest that the maternal immune profile of the CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells could be a determining factor in the congenital transmission of T. cruzi.

AB  - Objective To describe mortality from neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in Brazil, 2000-2011.
   Methods We extracted information on cause of death, age, sex, ethnicity and place of residence from the nationwide mortality information system at the Brazilian Ministry of Health. We selected deaths in which the underlying cause of death was a neglected tropical disease (NTD), as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and based on its International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes. For specific NTDs, we estimated crude and age-adjusted mortality rates and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We calculated crude and age-adjusted mortality rates and mortality rate ratios by age, sex, ethnicity and geographic area.
   Findings Over the 12-year study period, 12 491 280 deaths were recorded; 76 847 deaths (0.62%) were caused by NTDs. Chagas disease was the most common cause of death (58 928 deaths; 76.7%), followed by schistosomiasis (6319 deaths; 8.2%) and leishmaniasis (3466 deaths; 4.5%). The average annual age-adjusted mortality from all NTDs combined was 4.30 deaths per 100 000 population (95% CI: 4.21-4.40). Rates were higher in males: 4.98 deaths per 100000; people older than 69 years: 33.12 deaths per 100000; Afro-Brazilians: 5.25 deaths per 100000; and residents in the central-west region: 14.71 deaths per 100000.
   Conclusion NTDs are important causes of death and are a significant public health problem in Brazil.There is a need for intensive integrated control measures in areas of high morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is considered as one of the major neglected tropical diseases due to its magnitude and wide geographic distribution. Leishmania braziliensis, responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis, is the most prevalent species in Brazil. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) belongs to the antioxidant pathway of the parasites and human host. Despite the differences between SOD of Leishmania braziliensis and human make this enzyme a promising target for drug development efforts. No medicinal chemistry effort has been made to identify LbSOD inhibitors. Herein, we show that thermal shift assays (TSA) and fluorescent protein-labeled assays (FPLA) can be employed as primary and secondary screens to achieve this goal. Moreover, we show that thiazole derivatives bind to LbSOD with micromolar affinity.

AB  - The detection and inference of arbitrarily shaped spatial clusters in aggregated geographical areas is described here as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. A multi-objective dynamic programming algorithm, the Geo Dynamic Scan, is proposed for this formulation, finding a collection of Pareto-optimal solutions. It takes into account the geographical proximity between areas, thus allowing a disconnected subset of aggregated areas to be included in the efficient solutions set. It is shown that the collection of efficient solutions generated by this approach contains all the solutions maximizing the spatial scan statistic. The plurality of the efficient solutions set is potentially useful to analyze variations of the most likely cluster and to investigate covariates. Numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the algorithm. A study case with Chagas' disease clusters in Brazil is presented, with covariate analysis showing strong correlation of disease occurrence with environmental data.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is a complex of zoonotic diseases caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania,which can develop in domestic as well as wild animals and humans throughout the world. Currently, this disease is spreading in rural and urban areas of non-endemic regions in Brazil. Recently, bats have gained epidemiological significance in leishmaniasis due to its close relationship with human settlements. In this study, we investigated the presence of Leishmania spp. DNA in blood samples from 448 bats belonging to four families representing 20 species that were captured in the Triangulo Mineiro and Alto Paranaiba areas of Minas Gerais State (non-endemic areas for leishmaniasis), Brazil. Leishmania spp. DNA was detected in 8.0% of the blood samples, 41.6% of which were Leishmania infantum, 38.9% Leishmania amazonensis and 19.4% Leishmania brasiliensis. No positive correlation was found between Leishmania spp. and bat food source. The species with more infection rates were the insectivorous bats Eumops perotis; 22.2%(4/18) of which tested positive for Leishmania DNA. The presence of Leishmania in the bat blood samples, as observed in this study, represents epidemiological importance due to the absence of Leishmaniasis cases in the region.

AB  - Chagas disease discovered more than a century ago remains an incurable disease. The objective of this work was to investigate the therapeutic potential of cardiomyocytes derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (CM-mESC) in a model of chronic Chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC). Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) were characterized, transduced with luciferase, and submitted to cardiac differentiation. CM-mESC were labeled with superparamagnetic iron oxide particles. To induce CCC, mice were infected with Brazil strain trypomastigotes. At 150 days post-infection (dpi), infected animals were treated with CM-mESC or PBS. Cells were detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bioluminescence. Cardiac function was evaluated by MRI and electrocardiogram at 150 and 196 dpi. CCC mice showed significant differences in MRI and ECG parameters compared to non-infected mice. However, no differences were observed in contractile and electrical parameters between cell and PBS injected groups, 45 days after cell transplantation. Cells were detected 24 h after transplantation by MRI. CM-mESC bioluminescence tracking demonstrated over 90% decrease in signal 8 days after treatment. Nevertheless, the Infected + CM-mESC group showed a significant reduction in the percentage of collagen fibers when compared to the Infected + PBS group. In conclusion, CM-mESC therapy was not effective in reversing cardiac functional changes induced by Chagas disease despite some improvement in myocardial fibrosis.

AB  - In this study, the in vitro antimicrobial, antiparasitic, antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities of essential oil from Baccharis parvidentata Malag. (EO-Bp) and Lippia origanoides Kunth (EO-Lo) were explored. The relevant effects were observed against the parasitic protozoans Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania amazonensis (ranging 0.6 to 39.7 mu g/mL) and malignant MCF-7, MCF-7/HT, 22Rv1, and A431 cell lines (ranging 6.1 to 31.5 mu g/mL). In parallel, EO-Bp showed better selective indexes in comparison with EO-Lo against peritoneal macrophages from BALB/c mice and MRC-5 cell line. In conclusion, EO-Lo is known to show a wide range of health benefits that could be added as another potential use of this oil with the current study. In the case of EO-Bp, the wide spectrum of its activities against protozoal parasites and malignant cells, as well as its selectivity in comparison with non-malignant cells, could suggest an interesting candidate for further tests as a new therapeutic alternative.

AB  - Trypanosoma caninum is a parasite recently described in dogs, whose life cycle is rather unknown. Here, we performed a genetic study with T. caninum samples obtained in different Brazilian regions. The study was based on PCR assays target to small and large subunit ribosomal DNA (rDNA) (18S rDNA and 24S alpha rDNA), cytochrome B (Cyt b), and internal transcribed spacer 1 rDNA (ITS1 rDNA) following by the sequence analysis. Additionally, we used primers for the variable regions of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) minicircles and endonucleases restriction in the ITS1 rDNA amplification product. T. caninum samples displayed the same patterns. Tree construction confirmed the close relationship between T. caninum samples, regardless of the molecular target used and endonuclease restriction digestion revealed that all samples have the same restriction profile. Therefore, T. caninum seems to be a genetically homogeneous specie. In the kDNA assay, T. caninum possessed a different molecular size profile with respect to others trypanosomes, 330 and 350 bp. This study provides nucleotide sequences from different regions of the genome of T. caninum that certainly facilitate future studies.

AB  - The goal of this work was to explore the thermal relationship between foraging Triatoma brasiliensis and its natural habitat during the hottest season in the state of Ceara, Brazil. The thermal profiles were determined using infrared analysis. Although the daily temperature of rock surfaces varied in a wide range, T. brasiliensis selected to walk through areas with temperatures between 31.7-40.5 degrees C. The temperature of T. brasiliensis body surface ranged from 32.8-34.4 degrees C, being higher in legs than the abdomen. A strong relationship was found between the temperature of the insect and the temperature of rock crevices where they were hidden (r: 0.96, p < 0.05). The species was active at full sunlight being a clear example of how the light-dark rhythm may be altered, even under predation risk. Our results strongly suggest a thermal borderline for T. brasiliensis foraging activity near 40 degrees C. The simultaneous determination of insect body and rock temperatures here presented are the only obtained in natural habitats for this or other triatomines.

AB  - To complement the epidemiological data and assist in the prophylaxis of Chagas disease in the State of Sao Paulo, we examined entomological lifting conducted in 40 municipalities of the Western region of the state from 2004 to 2008, highlighted the main vector species in this region, and reanalyzed the cytogenetic characteristics of Rhodnius neglectus from 3 different Brazilian states (Formoso/GO, Frutal/MG, Guaira/SP, and Pitangueiras/SP). The municipalities of Castilho and Santo Antonio do Acarangua registered the highest relative amounts of notifications. The main species notified in Western Sao Paulo were Triatoma sordida and R. neglectus. We collected a large number of T. sordida in 2005 and noted the absence of notification of infected insects in 2008. We observed no variation in chromosomal characteristics of R. neglectus of different states. These data are complementary to the survey presented from 1990 to 1999, as the vector species were the same (T. sordida and R. neglectus), with emphasis on T. sordida. We corroborate the future colonization domiciliary initially proposed for T. sordida in the region and underscore the importance of vector control programs in the prophylaxis of Chagas disease. Furthermore, we observed that the populations of R. neglectus in Brazil showed no intraspecific variation and we corroborated the chromosomal patterns originally described. These data are important for understanding the evolution of these hematophagous insects, which are vectors of Chagas disease.

AB  - Background: In general, there was a large reduction in the occurrence of cases of Chagas disease in the last decades in Brazil. However, despite all of these efforts, there have been various reports of persistent reinfestations of T. sordida in a large part of the state of Minas Gerais, for reasons still little investigated. Thus, this purpose of this study was to characterize the deltamethrin susceptibility profile of peridomestic T. sordida populations from North of Minas Gerais - Brazil.
   Methods: Susceptibility to deltamethrin was assessed in seventeen peridomestic populations of T. sordida from North region of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Serial dilutions of deltamethrin in acetone (0.2 mu L) were topically applied in first instar nymphs (F1, five days old, fasting, weight 1.2 +/- 0.2 mg). Dose response results were analyzed with POLO program, determining the lethal doses, slope and resistance ratios (RR).
   Results: Susceptibility profile characterization of T. sordida populations revealed resistance ratios (RR50) ranging from 2.50 to 7.08.
   Conclusions: In fact, we know very little about the real impact of the resistance ratios obtained in the laboratory bioassays on the effectiveness of the vector control activities in the field. Thus, we prefer to refer to the populations with RR > 5 as populations with altered susceptibility. For these populations, the realization of laboratory and field trials, simultaneous and complementary, permitting the evaluation of both, is recommended.

AB  - High throughput sequencing (HTS) provides new research opportunities for work on non-model organisms, such as differential expression studies between populations exposed to different environmental conditions. However, such transcriptomic studies first require the production of a reference assembly. The choice of sampling procedure, sequencing strategy and assembly workflow is crucial. To develop a reliable reference transcriptome for Triatoma brasiliensis, the major Chagas disease vector in Northeastern Brazil, different de novo assembly protocols were generated using various datasets and software. Both 454 and Illumina sequencing technologies were applied on RNA extracted from antennae and mouthparts from single or pooled individuals. The 454 library yielded 278 Mb. Fifteen Illumina libraries were constructed and yielded nearly 360 million RNA-seq single reads and 46 million RNA-seq paired-end reads for nearly 45 Gb. For the 454 reads, we used three assemblers, Newbler, CAP3 and/or MIRA and for the Illumina reads, the Trinity assembler. Ten assembly workflows were compared using these programs separately or in combination. To compare the assemblies obtained, quantitative and qualitative criteria were used, including contig length, N50, contig number and the percentage of chimeric contigs. Completeness of the assemblies was estimated using the CEGMA pipeline. The best assembly (57,657 contigs, completeness of 80 %, < 1 % chimeric contigs) was a hybrid assembly leading to recommend the use of (1) a single individual with large representation of biological tissues, (2) merging both long reads and short paired-end Illumina reads, (3) several assemblers in order to combine the specific advantages of each.

AB  - A rich, collaborative program funded by the US NIH Fogarty program in 2004 has provided for a decade of remarkable opportunities for scientific advancement through the training of Brazilian undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students from the Federal University and Oswaldo Cruz Foundation systems at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The focus of the program has been on the development of trainees in the broad field of Infectious Diseases, with a particular focus on diseases of importance to the Brazilian population. Talented trainees from various regions in Brazil came to Einstein to learn techniques and study fungal, parasitic and bacterial pathogens. In total, 43 trainees enthusiastically participated in the program. In addition to laboratory work, these students took a variety of courses at Einstein, presented their results at local, national and international meetings, and productively published their findings. This program has led to a remarkable synergy of scientific discovery for the participants during a time of rapid acceleration of the scientific growth in Brazil. This collaboration between Brazilian and US scientists has benefitted both countries and serves as a model for future training programs between these countries.

AB  - The scientific community of Latin America (LA) has developed international leadership in tropical medicine research which has influenced the decline of diseases such as Chagas and malaria. Contributions of authors, institutions and scientific journals from Brazil and Colombia stand out in the struggle of more than 100 years to eradicate tropical diseases. Our aim in the present paper is to study how this international leadership has influenced the communication patterns of two of the regional journals that have aided in the construction of this prestige: Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (MIOC) from Brazil and Biomedica from Colombia, during the period of greatest international visibility of LA scientific journals, 2007-2015. The texts of the mentioned journals are used to study the relations of intertextuality between references and citations. Authors, references and citations of each text were classified according to three geographical origins: local, regional, and external. Resulting correlations are identified and compared. MIOC and Biomedica have improved their editorial policies and increased the international visibility of their papers without commercial publishing alliances and without changing their historical institutional mandate. The role played by Biomedica and MIOC has matured as accreditation sources of papers originating from the three geographical regions explored in the present work. We hope that this trend will continue and that both journals will play an increasingly more active role in the international system of scientific communication.

AB  - Introduction: we seek to quantify the returns on investment associated with an intervention in the public health system of a Municipality of the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. This intervention consists of strengthening the strategy for the Elimination of Mother-to-Child Transmission of HIV Infection, Syphilis, Congenital Chagas Disease and Perinatal Hepatitis B Infection, a strategy called ETMI-PLUS. Methodology: the study (quantitative) is based on the Social Return on Investment (RSI) methodology. Ad-hoc definitions are established for the measurement of returns based on the information available from various sources: primary information from the Ministry of Health of the MAB; rates of congenital transmission of each disease reported to the National Health Surveillance System; detailed budgets of the resources assigned to the project by Fundacion Mundo Sano and costs of treatments and supplies from official nomenclators. Results: for each argentinean peso invested in strengthening the ETMI-PLUS in the MAB, a return of almost 4 pesos would have been obtained thanks to the improvements in the vertical elimination of the 4 diseases and the reduction of cardiac complications in pregnant women. Conclusions: these results suggest the existence of a return / investment relationship favorable to the intervention, analyzed under a conservative analysis since savings for the health system are exclusively included and other dimensions of returns associated with improvements in results are excluded.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease that affects individuals in almost every country in Latin America. There are two available drugs with antiparasitic profiles; however, only benznidazole (BZN) has been approved for commercialization in Brazil. The usefulness of prescribing BZN for patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC) is controversial. There are no studies in the literature describing the extent of BZN use at this stage or the profile of patients using this drug. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with previous BZN use among individuals with CCC. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 1,812 individuals with CCC from 21 Brazilian cities endemic for CD. The dependent variable was "prior use of BZN" (no vs. yes). The independent variables were grouped into socioeconomic, lifestyle and medical history aspects. Binary logistic regression (alpha >= 0.05) was used. Among the evaluated individuals, 27.2% reported previous use of BZN. The likelihood of prior use of BZN was higher among younger individuals (OR = 2.7), individuals with a higher education (OR = 2.7), individuals with a lower monthly per capita income (OR = 1.3), individuals who practiced physical exercise (OR = 1.5), individuals who had prior knowledge of the CD diagnosis (OR = 2.5), individuals without hypertension (OR = 1.3) and individuals with a longer time to the CD diagnosis (OR = 6.1). The present study revealed a small proportion of therapeutic BZN use among Brazilian CCC patients. This finding suggests a late diagnosis and undertreatment of the disease. BZN use was higher among individuals with better clinical and demographic conditions but with a lower income and a longer time to the CD diagnosis. Knowledge of the BZN usage profile may help reduce the current state of neglect of this disease and pave the way for future studies.

AB  - Presence of Leishmania spp. was evaluated in the blood of nine red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus) from a specific area of French Guiana, located in the northeast of the Amazon. The molecular detection was performed based on PCR targeting the markers 18S rRNA, kDNA and ITS2 genes, as well as rapid immunomigration tests. Two monkeys were positive for Leishmania infantum and one for Leishmania guyanensis. While L. guyanensis cutaneous leishmaniasis is common, visceral leishmaniasis (human and canine) caused by L. infantum has never been described in this area. The howler monkey proved to be a sentinel and a potential reservoir of a serious zoonosis. These results must be carefully considered by public health officials and veterinarians in the future.

AB  - Author summary Chagas disease (CD) infection is a debilitating and neglected disease that occurs in 21 Latin America countries. CD has two distinct phases: acute and chronic. The generally asymptomatic acute phase begins shortly after infection and can last up to four months. When symptoms do appear, they are typically mild and unspecific. Following this phase, infected individuals evolve to a long-lasting chronic phase, which can be either symptomatic or asymptomatic. In Brazil, only acute cases are mandatorily notifiable in the Brazilian Notifiable Diseases Information System (Brazilian Ministry of Health). Most chronic cases are unknown and untreated. Considering that epidemiological data related to ACD is publicly available, we have analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution of notified cases of ACD and evaluated relevant epidemiological indicators throughout Brazil from 2001 to 2018. The data present here may contribute to surveillance actions designed at preventing new CD cases. We observed 5,184 cases of ACD during the period under study. The annual incidence rate in Brazil was 0.16 per 100,000 inhabitants/year. Three distinct epidemiological periods were identified: a rapid increase prior to 2005 (Period 1), a stable drop from 2005 to 2009 (Period 2), followed by another increasing trend after 2009 (Period 3). Vectorial transmission was the main route reported during Period 1, while oral transmission was found to increase significantly in the North during the other periods. Despite regional differences, over time cases of ACD decreased significantly nationwide. An increasing trend was noted in the North (especially after 2007). In light of the newly identified epidemiological profile of CD transmission in Brazil, we emphasize the need for strategically integrated entomological and health surveillance actions.
   Background In Brazil, acute Chagas disease (ACD) surveillance involves mandatory notification, which allows for population-based epidemiological studies. We conducted a nationwide population-based ecological analysis of the spatiotemporal patterns of ACD notifications in Brazil using secondary surveillance data obtained from the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) maintained by Brazilian Ministry of Health. Methodology/Principal findings In this nationwide population-based ecological all cases of ACD reported in Brazil between 2001 and 2018 were included. Epidemiological characteristics and time trends were analyzed through joinpoint regression models and spatial distribution using microregions as the unit of analysis. A total of 5,184 cases of ACD were recorded during the period under study. The annual incidence rate in Brazil was 0.16 per 100,000 inhabitants/year. Three statistically significant changes in time trends were identified: a rapid increase prior to 2005 (Period 1), a stable drop from 2005 to 2009 (Period 2), followed by another increasing trend after 2009 (Period 3). Higher frequencies were noted in males and females in the North (all three periods) and in females in Northeast (Periods 1 and 2) macroregions, as well as in individuals aged between 20-64 years in the Northeast, and children, adolescents and the elderly in the North macroregion. Vectorial transmission was the main route reported during Period 1, while oral transmission was found to increase significantly in the North during the other periods. Spatiotemporal distribution was heterogeneous in Brazil over time. Despite regional differences, over time cases of ACD decreased significantly nationwide. An increasing trend was noted in the North (especially after 2007), and significant decreases occurred after 2008 among all microregions other than those in the North, especially those in the Northeast and Central-West macroregions. Conclusions/Significance In light of the newly identified epidemiological profile of CD transmission in Brazil, we emphasize the need for strategically integrated entomological and health surveillance actions.

AB  - Background: Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has become the preferred alternative treatment to standard Heller myotomy for patients with esophageal achalasia, in Latin American countries. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a POEM in the management of achalasia with and without Chagas disease in patients receiving POEM. Methods: Patients who underwent POEM from tertiary centers in Latin America were included in a dedicated registry. Countries included Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. Patients enrolled needed to have a preoperative manometry and swallow contrast study confirming achalasia. Clinical success was defined as significant improvement in Eckardt score after therapy. Results: POEM was technically successful in 81/89 (91%) patients (mean age, 44 y). There was a significant decrease in preprocedure and postprocedure Eckardt score from 8.7 (range, 3 to 12) to 2.15 (0 to 10) (P<0.001), preprocedure and postprocedure barium swallow evaluation (98% vs. 89%; P=0.017), and preprocedure and postprocedure lower esophageal sphincter pressure measurement (from 35 to 13.8 mm Hg; P<0.001). Clinical success was achieved in 93% of patients. Patients with Chagas disease (n=58) were 9.5 times more likely to respond to POEM (P=0.0020; odds ratio, 9.5). Conclusions: POEM is an efficacious and safe therapeutic modality for treatment of achalasia in Latin America. Chagas disease-related achalasia seems to particularly respond better to POEM when it is performed by experienced endoscopists.

AB  - Nectandra leucantha (Lauraceae) is a tree indigenous to the tropical Atlantic forests of Brazil, one of the most biodiverse flora hotspots worldwide. This plant species contains high concentrations of neolignan and dehydrodieugenol derivatives that express significant in-vitro activities against various parasite strains. These activities are however responsible for severe tropical human infections, such as Leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.) and Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), which have been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). In order to optimize the isolation process for these target metabolites, n-hexane extract of the leaves was separated by means of semi-preparative high performance countercurrent chromatography (HPCCC) and scale-up spiral-coil countercurrent chromatography (sp-CCC) systems. Several biphasic solvent mixtures were evaluated for their partitioning effects on neolignans, resulting in the selection of an optimized system n-hexane - ethylacetate - methanol - water (7:3:7:3, v/v/v/v). The chromatographic experiments on the HPCCC and sp-CCC were run in the head-to-tail mode with 500 mg and 16 g injections, respectively. For specific and multiple metabolite detection, the recovered CCC-fractions were off-line injected, in the sequence of recovery, to an electrospray mass-spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) device. A projection of the single ion traces of the target compounds, in the positive ionization mode at a scan range of m/z 100-1500, located chromatographic areas where the co-elution effects occurred and pure target metabolites were present. Five major target neolignans were specifically detected, which enabled the accurate pooling of CCC-fractions for an optimum recovery of the metabolites. The direct comparison of the performance characteristics of the two CCC-devices, with very different mechanical designs was achieved by the conversion of the time axis into a partition ratio (K-D) separation scale. As a result, the compound specific K-D-elution values of the target neolignan were determined in high precision, while the comparison of the calculated separation factor (alpha) and resolution factor (R-s) values revealed a superior separation performance for the HPCCC system. Also, the reproducibility of detected metabolites in the two CCC experiments was confirmed by small variations (Delta K-D +/- 0.1). Neolignan target compounds with anti-parasite activities were successfully isolated in the 100 mg to 4 g range in a single lab-scale countercurrent chromatographic process step.

AB  - Pregnancy is known to induce a transient depression of maternal cell-mediated immunity, to prevent rejection of the fetus, while at the same time it keeps adequate maternal host defense mechanisms to fight infection. Presently, the aim of this paper was to investigate a possible endocrine and immunologic alteration observed during a successful pregnancy. This study consistently showed that plasma corticosterone levels were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in pregnant Wistar rats than in virgin female. An increased number of peritoneal macrophages was also detected in pregnant females when compared to non-pregnant ones. Macrophages play an important role in the production of bioactive proteins and lipids such as nitric oxide. Then, in support of the latter, the present study showed increased levels of endogenous NO in pregnant rats when compared to non-pregnant ones, thereby mediating the vasodilatation process of normal gestation. Furthermore, our FACS analysis clearly indicated the correlation between reduced CD161 expression on NK cells (P < 0.0001) in pregnant rats when compared to virgin females. It was found that pregnancy appears to be associated with depressed cell immunity, as evidenced by a significant inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation. Understanding the immunological paradox of maternal tolerance, as well as the hormonal modulation of the immune environment during pregnancy is essential for future studies to investigate the potential for these processes to be modulated by diet or effective therapeutics during pregnancy.

AB  - Background. Data on post-heart transplant (HT) survival of patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC) are scarce. We sought to evaluate post-HT survival in patients with CC as compared with other causes of heart failure across different eras of HT. Methods. We conducted a retrospective, cohort study of 376 adult HT recipients between October 1997 and November 2019. Participants were classified according to the etiology of heart failure as CC (N =66), nonischemic cardiomyopathy (N =214), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (N =96), and according to the era of HT as early (1997-2009), recent (2010-2014), and current era (2015-2019). Results. After a mean follow-up of 5.0 y (0-20.5 y), post-HT survival rates at 1, 5, and 10 y were comparable between groups. One-y survival improved from 70% in the early eras to 80% in the current era (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.97; P=0.034). After adjustment for sex, age, and mechanical circulatory support, time-related improvement in survival was observed only in patients without CC (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91; P=0.019) but not in those with CC (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.36-2.73; P=0.98). Causes of death were similar between patients with CC and the other etiological subgroups. Conclusions. Posttransplant survival is comparable between patients with CC, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Although survival has improved significantly over years for most HT recipients, it has remained unchanged for those with Chagas disease. These trends underscore the importance of scientific research, policy discussions and a collaborative registry of heart transplantation in Chagas cardiomyopathy.

AB  - The first autochthonous cases of cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis in the Americas were described in 1909, but visceral leishmaniasis only erupted as a public health problem in the region in 1934. Today Brazil is the country with the most cases of American tegumentary leishmaniasis, and alongside India has the highest incidence of visceral leishmaniasis. Knowledge production and efforts to control these diseases have mobilized health professionals, government agencies and institutions, international agencies, and rural and urban populations. My research addresses the exchange and cooperation networks they established, and uncertainties and controversial aspects when notable changes were made in the approach to the New World leishmaniases.

AB  - Environmental changes have a huge impact on the emergence and reemergence of certain infectious diseases, mostly in countries with high biodiversity and serious unresolved environmental, social, and economic issues. This article summarizes the most important findings with special attention to Brazil and diseases of present public health importance in the country such as Chikungunya, dengue fever, yellow fever, Zika, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, leptospirosis, leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease. An extensive literature review revealed a relationship between infectious diseases outbreaks and climate change events (El Nino, La Nina, heatwaves, droughts, floods, increased temperature, higher rainfall, and others) or environmental changes (habitat fragmentation, deforestation, urbanization, bushmeat consumption, and others). To avoid or control outbreaks, integrated surveillance systems and effective outreach programs are essential. Due to strong global and local influence on emergence of infectious diseases, a more holistic approach is necessary to mitigate or control them in low-income nations.

AB  - BACKGROUND Left ventricular aneurysm (LVA) is indicator of high morbidity in Chagas' disease. A cross-sectional study performed identified LVA in 18.8% of the chronic chagasic patients (CCP).
   OBJECTIVE Determine the risk of death of patients with chronic chagasic cardiopathy (CCC) and LVA in 24-year interval.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS In 1995 a cohort of 298 CCP was evaluated by anamnesis, physical examination, EKG and ECHO and classified in groups: G0 = 86 without cardiopathy; G1 = 156 with cardiopathy without LVA and G2 = 56 with cardiopathy and LVA. 38 patients of G0 and G1 used benznidazole. Information about the deaths was obtained in the notary, death certificates, hospital records and family members.
   FINDINGS Were registered 113 deaths (37.9%): 107 (35.9%) attributed to cardiopathy and 6 (2.0%) to other causes (p < 0.05). Amongst these 107 deaths, 10 (11.6%) occurred in G0; 49 (31.4%) occurred in G1 and 48 (85.7%) occurred in G2 (p < 0.05). The risk of death was 2.7 and 7.4 times significantly higher in G2, than in G1 and G0, respectively.
   CONCLUSION Chronic chagasic patients with LVA and ejection fraction < 45% have a higher risk of death than those without.

AB  - The essential oil was obtained from Croton linearis Jacq. leaves. Its chemical composition was analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. A total of 82 compounds were identified, being the principal components: guaiol (7.93%); eudesma-4(15),7-dien-1 beta-ol (4.94%) and guaia-3,10(14)-dien-11-ol (4.52%). Antimicrobial activity was determined against six Candida spp., three bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia colt and Pseudomona aeruginosa) and two parasites (Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi). The selectivity index (SI) was computed through the determination of it cytotoxicity on peritoneal macrophages from BALB/c mice and murine fibroblasts L929 cells. Colorimetric microdilution methods as well as direct counting in optical microscopes were performed. The essential oil showed remarkable activity against L. amazonensis (IC50Promastigotc: 20.0 +/- 4.9 mu g/mL; IC50Amastigote: 13.8 +/- 4.3 mu g/mL), moderate activity against T. cruzi (IC50Trypomastigoteote: 197.26 +/- 8.7 mu g/mL) and weak activity against P. aureginosa. Cytotoxicity values were CC50=89.1 +/- 3.4 mu g/mL for macrophages BALB/c and CC50 = 306 +/- 110 mu g/mL for L929 cells, rendering a SI of 6 for amastigote form of L. amazonensis. Croton linearis Jacq. leaf essential oil, therefore, could be a potential candidate for future investigations regarding Leishmaniasis treatment.

AB  - Background: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a sudden unexpected event, from a cardiac cause, that occurs in less than one hour after the symptoms onset, in a person without any previous condition that would seem fatal or who was seen without any symptoms 24 hours before found dead. Although it is a relatively frequent event, there are only few reliable data in underdeveloped countries.
   Objectives: We aimed to describe the features of SCD in Ribeirao Preto, Brazil (600,000 residents) according to Coroners' Office autopsy reports.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 4501 autopsy reports between 2006 and 2010, to identify cases of SCD. Specific cause of death as well as demographic information, date, location and time of the event, comorbidities and whether cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was attempted were collected.
   Results: We identified 899 cases of SCD (20%); the rate was 30/100000 residents per year. The vast majority of cases of SCD involved a coronary artery disease (CAD) (64%) and occurred in men (67%), between the 6th and the 7th decades of life. Most events occurred during the morning in the home setting (53.3%) and CPR was attempted in almost half of victims (49.7%). The most prevalent comorbidity was systemic hypertension (57.3%). Chagas' disease was present in 49 cases (5.5%).
   Conclusion: The majority of victims of SCD were men, in their sixties and seventies and the main cause of death was CAD. Chagas' disease, an important public health problem in Latin America, was found in about 5.5% of the cases.

AB  - Zoonoses are diseases or infections naturally transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans, and can be bacterial, viral or parasitic. The growth of urbanization, industrialization and the advance of agriculture and livestock facilitate the spread of infectious and parasitic agents from wild animals to the human population and to their domestic animals. Among the various reservoirs of zoonotic agents, we find that didelphid species, due to their high capacity for adaptation in urban environments, as an important study case. We reviewed the literature data on the pathogens, including with zoonotic potential of marsupial species occurring in Brazil, accounted for infections by agents that we categorized into Bacteria, Viruses, Protozoa, and Helminths. Aiming identifies possible knowledge gaps, we also surveyed the origin of studied samples and the institutions leading the researches on host didelphids. Among the hosts, the genus Didelphis in the cycles of these agents stands out. Moreover, we found that the majority of reported cases are in the Southeastern Brazil, mean the data from other Brazilian localities and didelphid species could be underestimated. Most studies took place in graduate programs of public research institutions, emphasizing the importance of the funding public research for the Brazilian scientific development.

AB  - Background: Following socio-economic turmoil in Venezuela, millions of the Venezuelan people are migrating to the neighboring Latin American countries including Brazil. Besides the social and economic burden of these migrants, Brazil must manage the health-related issues arising as consequence of these Venezuelan migrants.
   Poor health services in Venezuela along with unhygienic travelling conditions, lack of food (malnutrition) and potable water, unhealthy and overcrowded refugee camps or shelters, poor availability of medical services have made the migrant Venezuelan population susceptible to various diseases, especially infectious diseases.
   SINAN system is a health-related system in Brazil that keeps track of different health occurrences in the society and allows health care workers and policymakers free access to these data.
   Objectives: To evaluate the emergence of infectious diseases as a consequence of the arrival of Venezuelans immigrants in Brazil and to assess the importance of SINAN for epidemiological surveillance.
   Methods: Observational retrospective study. Data were collected from the SINAN system between 2015 and 2017 and was analyzed using descriptive statistics, and Mann-Whitney test (using SPSS tool version 12). Evaluated infectious diseases in this study were tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV/AIDS, syphilis, viral hepatitis, leishmaniasis, and malaria.
   Results: STIs were the most commonly reported diseases. Compared to Brazilians, Venezuelan migrants reported significantly higher number of HIV/Aids (p < 0.046) and leishmaniasis cases (p < 0.049), while Brazilians reported significantly higher number of hepatitis cases (p < 0.046). Malaria was also more prevalent among Venezuelan migrants than native Brazilians.
   Conclusion: Increased incidence of infectious diseases among the migrant population should be considered seriously as lack of adequate control of these diseases might lead to outbreaks. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. on behalf of Sociedade Brasileira de Infectologia.

AB  - Triatoma sordida is an endemic species to South America, currently considered the species most frequently found in the peridomestic environment in Brazil. This triatomine has a wide ecological tolerability that allows it to inhabit several ecotopes and use different food sources. Although the species is considered predominantly peridomestic, it is also capable of colonizing households and forming numerous intra-household colonies, leading to its inclusion among the priorities for triatomine control campaigns in Brazil. All Brazilian populations of T. sordida are considered as T. sordida sensu stricto by chromosomal analyses (which highlights their epide-miological importance), although molecular studies that characterize the genetic diversity of these populations are scarce, being restricted only to the region of Minas Gerais. Thus, several populations of this vector distributed in the states of Bahia, Goias, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Minas Gerais were analyzed using mitochondrial markers (cyt b and nd1). Low nucleotide diversity, high haplotypic diversity, low genetic distance, and high FST value were observed, as well as the formation of a monophyletic clade of the Brazilian populations of T. sordida, which confirms that this species has low genetic variability, with all specimens in Brazil grouped in T. sordida sensu stricto. In addition to the genetic and evolutionary importance for the knowledge of the biology of these vectors, these results are important from an epidemiological point of view, thus being able to direct vector control programs.

AB  - Background: The protozoanTrypanosoma cruzicirculates in semiarid areas of northeastern Brazil in distinct ecotopes (sylvatic, peridomestic and domestic) whereTriatoma brasiliensisNeiva, 1911 is the most important Chagas disease vector. In this study, we analyzed microevolutionary and demographic aspects ofT. brasiliensispopulations at the ecotypic, micro and macro-geographic scales by combining morphometrics and molecular results. Additionally, we aimed to address the resolution of both markers for delimiting populations in distinct scales.
   Methods: We sampled populations ofT. brasiliensisfrom distinct ecotypic and geographic sites in the states Rio Grande do Norte (RN) and Paraiba (PB). The geometric morphometry was carried out with 13 landmarks on the right wings (n= 698) and the genetic structure was assessed by sequencing a region of cytochromebmitochondrial gene (n= 221). Mahalanobis distance (MD) and coefficient of molecular differentiation (phi(ST)) were calculated among all pairs of populations. The results of comparisons generated MD and phi(ST)dendrograms, and graphics of canonical variate analysis (CVA).
   Results: Little structure was observed for both markers for macro-geographic scales. Mantel tests comparing geographic, morphometric and genetic matrices showed low correlation (allR(2)< 0.35). The factorial graphics built with the CVA evidenced population delimitation for the morphometric data at micro-geographic scales.
   Conclusions: We believe thatT. brasiliensiscarries in its genotype a source of information to allow the phenotypical plasticity across its whole distribution for shaping populations, which may have caused a lack of population delimitation for CVAs in morphometric analysis for macro-geographic scale analysis. On the other hand, the pattern of morphometric results in micro-geographic scales showed well-defined groups, highlighting the potential of this tool to inferences on the source for infestation.

AB  - Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas, including Brazil. We performed a nationwide population-based study including all deaths in Brazil from 2000 to 2011, in which STHs (ascariasis, trichuriasis and/or hookworm infection) were mentioned on death certificates, either as underlying or as associated causes of death. Epidemiological characteristics, time trends and spatial analysis of STH-related mortality were analysed. STHs was identified on 853/12 491 280 death certificates: 827 (97.0%) deaths related to ascariasis, 25 (2.9%) to hookworm infections, and 1 (0.1%) to trichuriasis. The average annual age-adjusted mortality rate was 0.34/1 000 000 inhabitants (95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.44). Females, children <10 years of age, indigenous ethnic groups and residents in the Northeast region had highest STH-related mortality rates. Nationwide mortality decreased significantly over time (annual percent change: -5.7%; 95% CI: -6.9 to -4.4), with regional differences. We identified spatial high-risk clusters for STH-related mortality mainly in the North, Northeast and South regions. Diseases of the digestive system and infectious/parasitic diseases were the most commonly associated causes of death mentioned in the STH-related deaths. Despite decreasing mortality in Brazil, a considerable number of deaths is caused by STHs, with ascariasis responsible for the vast majority. There were marked regional differences, affecting mainly children and vulnerable populations.

AB  - Introduction: Human T-lymphotropic virus types 1/2 (HTLV-1/2) are distributed worldwide and are endemic in specific regions. Methods: Serological evaluation of the HTLV-1/2 prevalence and co-infection rate [human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Chagas disease, and syphilis)] for 2011-2014 was performed with volunteer blood donors from the western part of Sao Paulo State. Results: Serrana and Aracatuba had higher HTLV seroprevalence rates (0.1%); while Franca, Olimpia, and Bebedouro had lower seroprevalences (0.04%). Co-infection (HBV and syphilis) was present in 12.3% of HTLV-infected blood donors. Conclusions: Our findings provide data for the prevalence of HTLV in Brazil and demonstrate the importance of regional and global hemovigilance.

AB  - Aims Patients with Chagas disease and heart failure (HF) have a poor prognosis similar to that of patients with ischaemic or dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the impact of body composition and muscle strength changes in these aetiologies is still unknown. We aimed to evaluate these parameters across aetiologies in two distinct cohort studies [TESTOsterone-Heart Failure trial (TESTO-HF; Brazil) and Studies Investigating Co-morbidities Aggravating Heart Failure (SICA-HF; Germany)].
   Methods and results A total of 64 male patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <= 40% were matched for body mass index and New York Heart Association class, including 22 patients with Chagas disease (TESTO-HF; Brazil), and 20 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and 22 patients with ischaemic heart disease (SICA-HF; Germany). Lean body mass (LBM), appendicular lean mass (ALM), and fat mass were assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Sarcopenia was defined as ALM divided by height in metres squared <7.0 kg/m(2)(ALM/height(2)) and handgrip strength cut-off for men according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People. All patients performed maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Chagasic and ischaemic patients had lower total fat mass (16.3 +/- 8.1 vs. 19.3 +/- 8.0 vs. 27.6 +/- 9.4 kg;P < 0.05) and reduced peak oxygen consumption (VO2) (1.17 +/- 0.36 vs. 1.15 +/- 0.36 vs. 1.50 +/- 0.45 L/min;P < 0.05) than patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, respectively. Chagasic patients showed a trend towards decreased LBM when compared with ischaemic patients (48.3 +/- 7.6 vs. 54.2 +/- 6.3 kg;P = 0.09). Chagasic patients showed lower handgrip strength (27 +/- 8 vs. 37 +/- 11 vs. 36 +/- 14 kg;P < 0.05) and FBF (1.84 +/- 0.54 vs. 2.75 +/- 0.76 vs. 3.42 +/- 1.21 mL/min/100 mL;P < 0.01) than ischaemic and dilated cardiomyopathy patients, respectively. There was no statistical difference in the distribution of sarcopenia between groups (P = 0.87). In addition, FBF correlated positively with LBM (r = 0.31;P = 0.012), ALM (r = 0.25;P = 0.046), and handgrip strength (r = 0.36;P = 0.004). In a logistic regression model using peak VO(2)as the dependent variable, haemoglobin (odds ratio, 1.506; 95% confidence interval, 1.043-2.177;P = 0.029) and ALM (odds ratio, 1.179; 95% confidence interval, 1.011-1.374;P = 0.035) were independent predictors for peak VO(2)adjusted by age, left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association, creatinine, and FBF.
   Conclusions Patients with Chagas disease and HF have decreased fat mass and exhibit reduced peripheral blood flow and impaired muscle strength compared with ischaemic HF patients. In addition, patients with Chagas disease and HF show a tendency to have greater reduction in total LBM, with ALM remaining an independent predictor of reduced functional capacity in these patients. The percentage of patients affected by sarcopenia was equal between groups.

AB  - This work evaluated the volatile composition, antioxidant and antiprotozoal activities of the essential oil obtained from leaves of Eugenia gracillima Kiaersk. (EGEO) grown in Brazilian Northeast area (Araripe, Brazil). The volatile compounds of EGEO were analyzed by GC and GC-MS and its chemical composition is mainly composed of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (91.22%), oxygenated sesquiterpenes (7.45%) and monoterpene (1.01%). The most abundant volatile constituents of the EGEO were germacrene D (16.10%), gamma-muurolene (15.60%), bicyclogermacrene (8.53%), germacrene B (7.43%), and Delta-elemene (6.06%). The oil showed weak to moderate antioxidant activity. EGEO was highly selective to Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania infantum promastigotes with selective indexes of 73.66 and 71.41, respectively. EGEO did not inhibit Trypanosoma cruzi. These data suggest that the E. gracillima essential oil is a relevant source of lead compounds for development of anti-Leishmania drugs.

AB  - Background Chagas disease (CD) is still an important public health issue in Latin America. This study aims to analyse the association between socio-epidemiological factors and comorbidities with clinical manifestations of CD. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study of 985 adult patients (65 +/- 11 y; 59.5% women) with CD. Data collection was based on questionnaires and medical records review. CD clinical forms (indeterminate, digestive, cardiac and cardiodigestive) and the stages of the cardiac form were classified according to the II Brazilian Consensus on CD. Statistical analyses were based on univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results Older age and Brazilian birth state (Minas Gerais and Bahia) were associated with a greater likelihood of the cardiac form of CD. A greater likelihood of the digestive form was seen in men and those of older age. Patients with arterial hypertension and diabetes were less likely to have the digestive form. Men had a greater likelihood of having a more severe cardiac presentation. Those from Minas Gerais and Bahia states had a greater likelihood of having stage B1 or B2. Conclusions The results reinforce the aging of the CD population living in urban areas in Brazil, the high prevalence of comorbidities and that epidemiology, sex and the presence of comorbidities may be related to the clinical form of CD.

AB  - A new species of rodent is added to the highly diverse genus Oecomys (Cricetidae, Sigmodontinae, Oryzomyini) based on specimens collected in the Argentinian provinces of Chaco and Formosa. The new species is characterized by a derived carotid circulatory pattern, a feature shared with O. concolor, O. mamorae, and O. sydandersoni. A unique combination of morphological, morphometric, and molecular characters, however, provides unambiguous evidence of its validity as a separate entity. Individuals of the new species are larger than other representatives of Oecomys, and their skulls have wide and cuneate interorbital regions with well-developed supraorbital shelves, long incisive foramina, long palates, absent alisphenoid struts, and broad Eustachian tubes. This new Oecomys appears to be endemic to the Humid Chaco, an ecoregion listed as Vulnerable due to the human impact. Preliminary observations suggest that several specimens from Eastern Paraguay and the Brazilian Pantanal could also be assigned to the new species described herein.

AB  - Hemoplasmas were detected in two apparently healthy captive South American coatis (Nasua nasua) from southern Brazil during an investigation for vector-borne pathogens. Blood was subjected to packed cell volume (PCV) determination, a commercial real-time PCR panel for the detection of Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., Hepatozoon spp., Leishmania spp., Mycoplasma haemofelis, 'Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis', 'Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum', Neorickettsia risticii, Rickettsia rickettsii and Leptospira spp., and a pan-hemoplasma conventional PCR assay. PCV was normal, but both coatis tested positive for hemoplasmas and negative for all the remaining pathogens tested. Using different techniques for microscopy (light, confocal or SEM), structures compatible with hemoplasmas were identified. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene identified an organism resembling Mycoplasma haemofelis and another hemotropic Mycoplasma sp., with a sequence identity of 96.8% to a Mycoplasma sp. previously detected in capybaras.

AB  - Introduction: The serological screening of blood donors has been instituted by the Brazilian Ministry of Health and is mandatory in the research on several diseases transmissible through blood transfusion. Blood banks need to establish a screening service capable of reducing associated transfusions risks.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to establish the prevalence of transfusion-transmissible infection markers in donors at a hemotherapy service located in southwest Bahia, Brazil.
   Methods: A retrospective study was performed between 2010 and 2016. Variables, such as the characterization of donors who were suitable and unsuitable for donation (in clinical screening), stratification by gender and age group and unsuitable samples for reactive test results (in serological screening) by aspecific antibodies against hepatitis B virus (anti-HBc and HBsAg), hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), human T-lymphotropic virus (anti-HTLV I/II), HIV virus (anti-HIV I/II), chagas disease, and syphilis markers, were evaluated.
   Results: Collected data showed that 3.13% of the donors were considered unsuitable for serological screening and that the prevalence of reactive test results was higher in donors aged between 30 and 39 years and in males. The means of the serological markers was 1.09% for syphilis reagents, 0.63% for anti-HIV I/II, 0.51% for anti-HBc and anti-HCV, 0.15% for HBsAg, 0.14% for HTLV I/II and 0.10% for Chagas disease.
   Conclusion: These results reflect the importance of awareness campaigns on sexually transmitted diseases and transfusion safety measures taken by hemotherapy services. (C) 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia Celular. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

KW  - PAINESD risk score

AB  - Purpose The PAINESD risk score was developed in 2015 as a tool to stratify the risk of acute hemodynamic decompensation during ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation in structural heart disease patients and further then used for post procedure 30-day mortality prediction. The original cohort however did not include Chagas disease (ChD) patients. We aim to evaluate the relevance of the score in a ChD population. Methods The PAINESD risk score gives weighted values for specific characteristics (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, age > 60 years, ischemic cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class 3 or 4, ejection fraction less than 25%, VT storm, and diabetes). The score was applied in a retrospective cohort of ChD VT ablations in a single tertiary center in Brazil. Data were collected by VT study reports and patient record analysis at baseline and on follow-up. Results Between January 2013 and December 2018, 157 VT catheter ablation procedures in 121 ChD patients were analyzed. Overall, 30-day mortality was 9.0%. Multivariate analysis correlated NYHA functional class (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.03-3.08, P 0.038) and the need for urgent surgery (HR 31.5, 95% CI 5.38-184.98, P < 0.001), as well as a tendency for VT storm at presentation (HR 2.72, 95% CI 0.87-8.50, P 0.084) as risk factors for the primary endpoint. The median PAINESD risk score in this population was 3 (3-8). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.64 (95% CI 0.479-0.814). Conclusions The PAINESD risk score did not perform well in predicting 30-day mortality in ChD patients. Pre-procedure NYHA functional class and the need for urgent surgery due to refractory pericardial bleeding were independently associated with increased 30-day mortality. Prospective studies are needed to take final conclusions in Chagas disease when using PAINESD score.

AB  - BACKGROUND Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) often require red blood cell (RBC) transfusion for clinical complications, so may be exposed to transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs). The prevalence of markers for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and B (HBV), human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1/2), Chagas disease, and syphilis in an SCD cohort in Brazil were studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Clinical history, interview data, blood samples, and medical chart review data were collected during cohort enrollment from November 2013 to May 2015. Serologic markers of infection were assessed. Standard measures of statistical association were calculated, and multivariable models were developed for the most prevalent infections to identify associated factors. RESULTS Infection markers were evident in 5.2% (144/2779) of the enrolled cohort. Anti-HCV was detected in 69 (2.5%), syphilis antibodies in 34 (1.2%), anti-HTLV-1/2 in 17 (0.6%), HBV surface antigen in 13 (0.5%), Chagas disease antibodies in 13 (0.5%), and anti-HIV in 8 (0.3%) of participants. Factors associated with increased odds of being anti-HCV reactive were older age, illegal drug use, increasing number of RBCs, more than three pain crises in the previous year, and geographic location. Syphilis was associated with older age, females, and smoking history. CONCLUSION HCV infection was more common in older patients who may have received RBCs before testing was performed on donations, suggesting possible historic transfusion transmission. The cohort showed decreasing rates of infections and a reduction in transfusion transmission markers in younger patients compared to historical literature except for syphilis, indicating contemporary reduced risk of TTI.

AB  - This study describes the morphological, biochemical, and molecular differences among Trypanosoma dionisii isolates from hemocultures of hematophagous (Desmodus rotundus; n = 2) and insectivorous (Lonchorhina aurita; n = 1) bats from the Atlantic Rainforest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Fusiform epimastigotes from the hematophagous isolates were elongated, whereas those of the insectivorous isolate were stumpy, reflected in statistically evident differences in the cell body and flagellum lengths. In the hemocultures, a higher percentage of trypomastigote forms (60%) was observed in the hematophagous bat isolates than that in the isolate from the insectivorous bat (4%), which demonstrated globular morphology. Three molecular DNA regions were analyzed: V7V8 (18S rDNA), glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, and mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The samples were also subjected to multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. All isolates were identified as T. dionisii by phylogenetic analysis. These sequences were clustered into two separate subgroups with high bootstrap values according to the feeding habits of the bats from which the parasites were isolated. However, other T. dionisii samples from bats with different feeding habits were found in the same branch. These results support the separation of the three isolates into two subgroups, demonstrating that different subpopulations of T. dionisii circulate among bats.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected and endemic zoonosis that occurs throughout Brazil; nevertheless, few studies have focused on the early detection of the disease. The municipality of Ourinhos is a non-receptive, silent and vulnerable area for VL, where the seroprevalence of this disease has so far not been investigated. The present study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of canine VL in Ourinhos-SP, and to identify the presence of risk factors. Blood samples were obtained from 604 dogs during a rabies vaccination campaign together with application of a socioeconomic questionnaire, environmental and animal characteristics and tutor's knowledge about the disease. The samples were subjected to indirect ELISA and new samples were collected from reactive and suspect animals, including whole blood and lymph node aspiration evaluated by parasitological method, complete blood count and PCR. No animal was diagnosed as positive based on the combination of direct and indirect tests and the tutors' answers indicated little knowledge about leishmaniasis, being often confused with other diseases transmitted by arthropods; hence, according to the proposed methods, the presence of canine leishmaniasis in the city of Ourinhos was not confirmed and health education campaigns about the disease should be carried out.

AB  - Introduction: Combined solid organ transplantation is infrequently performed in Brazil. The objective of this article is to present our initial experience with combined heart and kidney transplantation.
   Methods: From January 2007 to December 2019, four patients were submitted to combined heart and kidney transplantation. Their mean age was 55.7 +/- 4.4 years, and three (75%) patients were males. All patients had Chagas cardiomyopathy, two were hospitalized and inotrope dependent, and all patients were on preoperative dialysis (median of 12 months prior to transplant).
   Results: All patients survived and were in New York Heart Association functional class I at the latest follow-up (mean 34.7 +/--17.5 months). Mean retarded kidney graft function was 22.9 +/- 9.7 days. One patient lost the kidney graft two years after the transplant due to Polyomavirus infection.
   Conclusion:Our initial experience of combined heart and kidney transplantation was favorable in selected patients with advanced heart failure and end-stage kidney disease. It requires involvement of a dedicated multispecialty team throughout all the diagnostics and treatment steps.

AB  - In the wake of disasters, the lack of information on how to handle and dispose of corpses leads the professionals involved in emergency operations to uncertainty about associated risks and safety precautions. The article seeks to establish the risks of the etiologic agents involved in Brazilian mortality due to infectious diseases and identify and discuss the main protection measures for professionals involved in handling of corpses in disaster situations. It involved a survey of deaths by infectious diseases in Brazil between 2005 and 2010, using data from the Mortality Information System. Of the 171,223 deaths analyzed, the pathogens leading to the greatest number of deaths were: HIV, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Trypanosoma cruzi. 59% belonged to risk class 3 and 40.6% to risk class 2. Eight deaths were caused by risk class 4 pathogens, which represent high risk. The professionals involved in the handling of corpses may be exposed to chronic risks, such as viruses transmitted via blood, gastrointestinal infections and tuberculosis. These findings indicate the importance of investment in the preparation of measures to reduce the risk of infection associated with the handling of corpses.

AB  - Didelphis (Marsupialia, Didelphimorphia) are synanthropic mammals, whose omnivorous diet predisposes them to infections caused by endoparasites. Their higher frequency in urban areas makes them potential carriers of zoonotic protozoans and helminths, enhancing potential transmission to humans. Our purpose was to study two common species, Didelphis albiventris (54 individuals) and D. aurita (2 individuals), which were screened for blood, skin and intestinal parasites in animals captured in urban areas and in riparian forest regions associated with the Capivari River Basin, in Monte Mor's municipality, Sao Paulo state (SP), Brazil. Blood and tissue samples were collected for DNA extraction and PCR. Fecal samples were collected and submitted to two sedimentation and two flotation methods. 77.6% of fecal samples were positive for nematode eggs, 34.5% for trematode eggs and 32.7% for protozoans. Two D. aurita specimens were naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. Molecular analysis in a D. albiventris captured on a forested rural area was positive for Leishmania sp. DNA. Several parasites were found infecting Didelphis sp., demonstrating that this group of animals can harbor important zoonotic parasites, potentially playing a role as sylvatic reservoirs for human and domestic animal pathogens.

AB  - Brazil is a large country, with an evolving economy, but marked social inequalities. The population is formed by an admixture of native Brazilians, Europeans, and Africans; is predominantly urban; and faces rapid aging. Time trends related to health behaviors show a substantial reduction in smoking rates, but a rising prevalence of overweight and obesity, unhealthy eating habits, and insufficient physical activity. The high prevalence of hypertension and the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus are also causes for concern. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the leading cause of mortality since the 1960s and has accounted for a substantial percentage of all hospitalizations. In 2011, CVD was responsible for 31% of all deaths, with ischemic heart disease (31%) and cerebrovascular diseases (30%) being the leading CVD causes. Despite an increase in the overall number of CVD deaths, the age-adjusted mortality rates for CVD declined 24% between 2000 and 2011. Health care delivered by Brazil's universal public health system, which focuses on primary prevention, has contributed to this achievement. However, the decline in age-adjusted mortality differs according to race, sex, and socioeconomic status with black individuals and lower-income populations sustaining the greatest impact of CVD, especially at younger ages. With one of the world's largest public health systems in terms of population coverage, Brazil has the means to implement actions to confront the high burden of CVD, focusing on health promotion and comprehensive care. Insufficient funding, low education levels, and social inequalities remain as the main barriers to be overcome.

AB  - Background Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) disproportionately affect populations living in resource-limited settings. In the Amazon basin, substantial numbers of NTDs are zoonotic, transmitted by vertebrate (dogs, bats, snakes) and invertebrate species (sand flies and triatomine insects). However, no dedicated consortia exist to find commonalities in the risk factors for or mitigations against bite-associated NTDs such as rabies, snake envenoming, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis in the region. The rapid expansion of COVID-19 has further reduced resources for NTDs, exacerbated health inequality and reiterated the need to raise awareness of NTDs related to bites. Methods The nine countries that make up the Amazon basin have been considered (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Surinam and Venezuela) in the formation of a new network. Results The Amazonian Tropical Bites Research Initiative (ATBRI) has been created, with the aim of creating transdisciplinary solutions to the problem of animal bites leading to disease in Amazonian communities. The ATBRI seeks to unify the currently disjointed approach to the control of bite-related neglected zoonoses across Latin America. Conclusions The coordination of different sectors and inclusion of all stakeholders will advance this field and generate evidence for policy-making, promoting governance and linkage across a One Health arena.

AB  - Objectives The present study aimed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of an exercise-based cardiovascular rehabilitation (CR) program in patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCC). Methods Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomised clinical trial evaluating the effects of a 6-month exercise-based CR program. The intervention group underwent 3 weekly exercise sessions. The variation of peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) was used as a measurement of clinical outcome. Cost information from all healthcare expenses (examinations, healthcare visits, medication and hospitalisation) were obtained from the medical records in Brazilian reais (R$) and transformed into dollars using the purchasing power parity ($PPP). The longitudinal costs variation was evaluated through linear mixed models, represented by beta coefficient, adjusted for the baseline values of the dependent variable. The cost-effectiveness evaluation was determined through an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using the HEABS package (Stata 15.0). Results The intervention group presented higher costs with healthcare visits (beta = +3317.3; p < 0.001), hospitalisation (beta = +2810.4; p = 0.02) and total cost (beta = +6407.9; p < 0.001) after 3 months of follow-up. Costs related to healthcare visits (beta = +2455.8; p < 0.001) and total cost (beta = +4711.4; p < 0.001) remained higher in the intervention group after 6 months. The CR program showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $PPP 1874.3 for each increase of 1.0 ml kg(-1) min(-1) of VO2peak. Conclusions The CR program can be considered a cost-effective alternative and should be included as an intervention strategy in the care of patients with CCC.

AB  - In the past 5-10 years, Venezuela has faced a severe economic crisis, precipitated by political instability and declining oil revenue. Public health provision has been affected particularly. In this Review, we assess the impact of Venezuela's health-care crisis on vector-borne diseases, and the spillover into neighbouring countries. Between 2000 and 2015, Venezuela witnessed a 359% increase in malaria cases, followed by a 71% increase in 2017 (411 586 cases) compared with 2016 (240 613). Neighbouring countries, such as Brazil, have reported an escalating trend of imported malaria cases from Venezuela, from 1538 in 2014 to 3129 in 2017. In Venezuela, active Chagas disease transmission has been reported, with seroprevalence in children (<10 years), estimated to be as high as 12.5% in one community tested (n=64). Dengue incidence increased by more than four times between 1990 and 2016. The estimated incidence of chikungunya during its epidemic peak is 6975 cases per 100 000 people and that of Zika virus is 2057 cases per 100 000 people. The re-emergence of many vector-borne diseases represents a public health crisis in Venezuela and has the possibility of severely undermining regional disease elimination efforts. National, regional, and global authorities must take action to address these worsening epidemics and prevent their expansion beyond Venezuelan borders.

AB  - Background
   Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) are important causes of morbidity, disability, and mortality among poor and vulnerable populations in several countries worldwide, including Brazil. We present the burden of NTDs in Brazil from 1990 to 2016 based on findings from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016).
   Methodology
   We extracted data from GBD 2016 to assess years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for NTDs by sex, age group, causes, and Brazilian states, from 1990 to 2016. We included all NTDs that were part of the priority list of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2016 and that are endemic/autochthonous in Brazil. YLDs were calculated by multiplying the prevalence of sequelae multiplied by its disability weight. YLLs were estimated by multiplying each death by the reference life expectancy at each age. DALYs were computed as the sum of YLDs and YLLs.
   Principal findings
   In 2016, there were 475,410 DALYs (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 337,334-679,482; age-standardized rate of 232.0 DALYs/100,000 population) from the 12 selected NTDs, accounting for 0.8% of national all-cause DALYs. Chagas disease was the leading cause of DALYs among all NTDs, followed by schistosomiasis and dengue. The sex-age-specific NTD burden was higher among males and in the youngest and eldest (children <1 year and those aged >= 70 years). The highest age-standardized DALY rates due to all NTDs combined at the state level were observed in Goias (614.4 DALYs/100,000), Minas Gerais (433.7 DALYs/100,000), and Distrito Federal (430.0 DALYs/100,000). Between 1990 and 2016, the national age-standardized DALY rates from all NTDs decreased by 45.7%, with different patterns among NTD causes and Brazilian states. Most NTDs decreased in the period, with more pronounced reduction in DALY rates for onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, and rabies. By contrast, age-standardized DALY rates due to dengue, visceral leishmaniasis, and trichuriasis increased substantially. Age-standardized DALY rates decreased for most Brazilian states, increasing only in the states of Amapa A, Ceara A, Rio Grande do Norte, and Sergipe.
   Conclusions/Significance
   GBD 2016 findings show that, despite the reduction in disease burden, NTDs are still important and preventable causes of disability and premature death in Brazil. The data call for renewed and comprehensive efforts to control and prevent the NTD burden in Brazil through evidence-informed and efficient and affordable interventions. Multi-sectoral and integrated control and surveillance measures should be prioritized, considering the population groups and geographic areas with the greatest morbidity, disability, and most premature deaths due to NTDs in the country.

AB  - The Triatoma sordida subcomplex traditionally included four triatomine species, T. sordida, Triatoma garciabesi, Triatoma guasayana, and Triatoma patagonica, distributed in the Southern Cone of South America. These species have a large intraspecific variability together with an overall similarity, making difficult to establish their taxonomic status. Many cytogenetic, morphometric, and molecular markers have been applied to address this. Recent studies have posed concerns on the inclusion of T. guasayana and T. patagonica within the subcomplex. Also, T. sordida from Argentina has been designed as a new species, Triatoma rosai. Using the cuticular hydrocarbon pattern as chemotaxonomic marker, the relationships among several populations of these species were analyzed by capillary gas chromatography and linear discriminant analysis along 25 collection sites in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay. T. sordida and T. rosai populations were differentially clustered in two CHC-based groups: "Group 1" included T. sordida from Eastern Brazil, Eastern Paraguay, and the Bolivian populations from La Paz and Izozog G1; "Group 2" included T. rosai, and T. sordida from Izozog G2 (Bolivia), and Western Paraguay. Whereas T. garciabesi remained closely related to T. sordida and T. rosai, T. guasayana, and T. patagonica were clearly separated from the species of the T. sordida subcomplex. Our results agree with those from other several techniques suggesting that the taxonomy of the T. sordida subcomplex should be revised.

AB  - Therapy against Trypanosma cruzi relies on only two chemically related nitro-derivative drugs, benznidazole and nifurtimox, both limited by poor efficacy and toxicity. It is suspected that with prolonged usage of these drugs, resistant parasites will be selected, which results in risk for treatment failure over the time. Herein, we studied the in vitro activity of artesunate, the most effective drug to treat severe P. falciparum and chloroquine-resistant P. vivax, on three strains of T. cruzi originated in different regions of Latin America (Argentina, Nicaragua and Brazil). The results of these assays showed that artesunate inhibits multiplication of epimastigotes (IC50 = 50, 6.10 and 23 mu M, respectively) and intracellular amastigotes (IC50 = 15, 0.12 and 6.90 mu M, respectively), indicating that it represents a potent anti-T. cruzi compound in terms of inhibiting parasite multiplication in vitro. We then tested the effect of artesunate in Balb/c mice infected with Brazil strain and found that it failed to cure the infection, suggesting that the drug may be unsuitable for in vivo treatment. When infected mice were treated with high doses AS + BZ, the outcome of infection was similar to that observed in mice treated with BZ alone. Nevertheless, understanding of structure-activity relationship of artesunate might lead to the development of new and effective drugs against T. cruzi. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Chagas disease (CD) is an important public health problem in Brazil and worldwide. Aging and obesity are important matters in patients with CD, as is hypovitaminosis D3, which can decrease the quality of life of these patients. Immunomodulation mediated by vitamin D3, especially the production of antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin LL-37, might be related to the severity and symptoms of CD. This study aimed to determine the serum levels of vitamin D and LL37 and VDR gene polymorphisms in patients with chronic CD. Methods: This study included male patients with cardiac and indeterminate clinical forms of CD. Clinical, anthropometric, and blood parameters were obtained. Serum levels of 25(OH)D3 and LL-37 were determined by chemiluminescence and enzyme-linked immunosoibent assay respectively. Fok (rs731236), Bsm (rs1544410), Apa (rs7975232), and Taq (rs731236) polymorphisms of the VDR gene were investigated by PCR-RFLP. Results: Sixty-four patients were included in the study: 18 of the cardiac form and 46 of the indeterminate form. No differences in age, ethnicity, BMI, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemias were observed between groups. However, the serum levels of 25(OH)D3, but not of LL-37, were lower in the cardiac form group. The association among polymorphisms, vitamin D, and clinical form was not significant. Conclusions: Decreased levels of vitamin D suggest an association with the cardiac form of CD. Studies investigating the roles of vitamin D and LL-37 in the immune response and their associations with VDR polymorphisms and disease susceptibility are necessary.

AB  - Dogs have been implicated as main reservoirs for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in urban areas. Therefore, studies on this species provide important data for public health. Thus, the objective of the present study was to ascertain the seroprevalence of canine VL (CVL) and the associated factors in the Brejo Paraibano microregion, northeastern Brazil. A total of 409 dogs were sampled from the eight municipalities of the microregion: Alagoa Grande, Alagoa Nova, Areia, Bananeiras, Borborema, Matinhas, Piloes and Serraria. The diagnosis of CVL was made using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA S7 (R)), through which the prevalence observed was 29.3%. By robust Poisson regression analysis two factors were associated with seroprevalence: illiterate/incomplete elementary owner's education level (prevalence ratio = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.05-2.34; p-value = 0.027) and tick infestation (prevalence ratio = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.27-2.61; p-value = 0.001). It is concluded that the seroprevalence of CVL in the Brejo Paraibano microregion is high. The factors associated with seroprevalence indicated the importance to develop socioeducational actions on the population, and the finding that tick infestation was associated with seroprevalence shows that there is a need for investigation regarding the role of ticks in the epidemiology of CVL.

AB  - Background Triatoma brasiliensisNeiva, 1911 is the main vector ofTrypanosoma cruziin the caatinga of Northeastern Brazil. Despite of its epidemiological relevance, there are few studies on its genetic variability. Using microsatellite markers, we characterized the variability and dynamics of infestation and reinfestation ofT. brasiliensisafter residual insecticide spraying in five surveys conducted in a well-defined rural area located in the municipality of Taua, Ceara, between 2009 and 2015. We evaluated: (1) general variability among local of captures; (2) variability along the time analysis (2009, 2010 and 2015); (3) and reinfestation process. Results On the analysis (1) global and pairwiseF(ST)values suggested absence of clusters among the area. AMOVA indicated that total variation is mainly represented by individual differences. Absence of clustering indicates a panmitic unit, with free gene flow. For (2), PairwiseF(ST)indicated alterations in the genetic profile of the triatomines along the time. (3) Analysis of the reinfestation process showed that the domiciliary units investigated had different sources of infestation despite of its proximity. Conclusions Observed homogeneity can be explained by the great dispersal capacity ofT. brasiliensis, overlapping the different environments. Persistent house infestation in Taua may be attributed to the occurrence of postspraying residual foci and the invasion of triatomines from their natural habitats.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease (CD) and ischemic stroke (IS) have a close, but poorly understood, association. There is paucity of evidence on the ideal secondary prophylaxis and etiological determination, with few cardioembolic patients being identified. Aims: This study aimed to describe a multicenter cohort of patients with concomitant CD and IS admitted in tertiary centers and to create a predictive model for cardioembolic embolism in CD and IS. Materials and methods: We retrospectively studied data obtained from electronic medical and regular medical records of patients with CD and IS in several academic, hospital-based, and university hospitals across Brazil. Descriptive analyses of cardioembolic and non-cardioembolic patients were performed. A prediction model for cardioembolism was proposed with 70% of the sample as the derivation sample, and the model was validated in 30% of the sample. Results: A total of 499 patients were analyzed. The median age was similar in both groups; however, patients with cardioembolic embolism were younger and tended to have higher alcoholism, smoking, and death rates. The predictive model for the etiological classification showed close relation with the number of abnormalities detected on echocardiography and electrocardiography as well as with vascular risk factors. Conclusions: Our results replicate in part those previously published, with a higher prevalence of vascular risk factors and lower median age in patients with cardioembolic etiology. Our new model for predicting cardioembolic etiology can help identify patients with higher recurrence rate and therefore allow an optimized strategy for secondary prophylaxis.

AB  - Background: Leprosy is a public health problem and a neglected condition of morbidity and mortality in several countries of the world. We analysed time trends and spatiotemporal patterns of leprosy-related mortality in Brazil.
   Methods: We performed a nationwide population-based study using secondary mortality data. We included all deaths that occurred in Brazil between 2000 and 2011, in which leprosy was mentioned in any field of death certificates.
   Results: Leprosy was identified in 7732/12 491 280 deaths (0.1%). Average annual age-adjusted mortality rate was 0.43 deaths/100 000 inhabitants (95% CI 0.40-0.46). The burden of leprosy deaths was higher among males, elderly, black race/colour and in leprosy-endemic regions. Lepromatous leprosy was the most common clinical form mentioned. Mortality rates showed a significant nationwide decrease over the period (annual percent change [APC]: -22.8%; 95% CI -4.2 to -2.4). We observed decreasing mortality rates in the South, Southeast and Central-West regions, while the rates remained stable in North and Northeast regions. Spatial and spatiotemporal high-risk clusters for leprosy-related deaths were distributed mainly in highly endemic and socio-economically deprived regions.
   Conclusions: Leprosy is a neglected cause of death in Brazil since the disease is preventable, and a cost-effective treatment is available. Sustainable control measures should include appropriate management and systematic monitoring of leprosy-related complications, such as severe leprosy reactions and adverse effects to multidrug therapy.

AB  - Objective. To present a method to identify critical areas for selected infectious and parasitic diseases for the purpose of health surveillance and to analyze the association between these critical areas and poverty indicators in Brazil.
   Method. The following incidence rates were mapped: dengue, acute Chagas disease, schistosomiasis, Hansen's disease, hepatitis A, cutaneous leishmaniasis, visceral leishmaniasis, leptospirosis, malaria, and tuberculosis. The analyses were performed for the period from 2010 to 2017 based on a synthetic indicator calculated as the mean of mean incidence coefficients for each disorder, normalized by the mean and standard deviation during the period of analysis. A 2014 population estimate was used. The calculated coefficients were stratified for classification of municipalities into very high, high, medium, low, or very low criticality according to each disorder. Indicators expressing several socioeconomic dimensions and space segregation in Brazilian municipalities were also selected and tested regarding their association with the transmission of the diseases under study.
   Results. The indicator showed that 40.5% of Brazilian municipalities had high criticality for the diseases of interest, especially in the North, parts of the Northeast, and Midwest. Indicators "proportion of poverty," "garbage in surroundings," and "families headed by women" increased the chance of higher criticality for the diseases. The indicator "adequate sewer system" was a potential protection factor.
   Conclusions. The technique used was adequate to guide surveillance actions in the country and allows articulation between local surveillance efforts and other sectors to resolve health problems caused by infectious and parasitic diseases and associated factors.

AB  - Calea uniflora Less., commonly known in Brazil as "erva-de-lagarto" and "arnica-da-praia", is used in folk medicine to treat internal and external bruises and as anti-inflammatory. However, despite the popular use there is a lack of information in terms of isolation and biological evaluation of its secondary metabolites. Thus, the aims of this study were to identify and characterize compounds of C. uniflora leaves with trypanocidal and leishmanicidal potential. Methods: Structures of compounds were determined by HRESIMS spectra, and 1D and 2D NMR spectra. Then, they were tested for in vitro leishmanicidal and trypanocidal activities against Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi intracellular amastigotes, respectively. Results: Four germacranolide-type sesquiterpene lactones were isolated and characterized from dichloromethane fraction: 2 alpha-hydroxy-8 beta-2',3',5'-trihydroxy-angeloyloxycostunolide (1), desacetyleupaserrin (2), 2 alpha-hydroxy-8 beta-3'-hydroxy-2',5'-epoxyangeloyloxycostunolide (3) and ovatifolin (4). All compounds are described herein for the first time for C. uniflora and Calea genus. Lactones 1, 2 and 4 demonstrated weak or no inhibition of the T. cruzi amastigotes, whereas compound 3 revealed a moderate effect (36.8%). Regarding the leishmanicidal activity, 4 exhibited a 59.9% inhibitory effect on the growth of L. amazonensis. Conclusion: None of the isolated compounds presented promising trypanocidal effect and 4 was the most active compound against L. amazonensis amastigotes.

AB  - Neuroparacoccidioidomycosis (NPCM) is a rare and severe clinical presentation of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM). We performed a retrospective cohort study at the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INI/Fiocruz), a reference center for PCM in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. All cases of PCM admitted to the INI/Fiocruz from January 2007 to December 2019 were reviewed. Eight (3.9%) among 207 patients met the diagnostic criteria for NPCM. The mean age was 44.6 years and the male:female ratio was 7:1. All cases presented multifocal disease, 5 (62.5%) the chronic form and 3 (37.5%) the acute/subacute form. All patients presented the pseudotumoral pattern and 6 (75.0%) had multiple lesions in the cerebral hemispheres. Seizures and motor symptoms were the most frequent clinical manifestations (50.0%, each). The treatment of choice was sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMZ-TMP) and fluconazole, in association (87.5%). Most patients responded well to the treatment. Sequela and death occurred in one (12.5%) patient, each.

AB  - Introduction: Congenital and perinatal infections are a leading cause of neonatal and infant morbidity and mortality. Maternal screening, vaccines or treatment where available, constitute effective prevention strategies to reduce the burden of these diseases. Data on the burden of congenital and perinatal infections are very limited for low and middle-income regions.Areas covered: This review aims to summarize the burden of congenital and perinatal infections and the main challenges for their control in resource-limited settings. Articles were identified through the main electronic databases and cover the period 1971-2016.Expert commentary: Estimates from low and middle-income countries indicate that the burden of congenital infections may be higher in these regions than in industrialized countries. As preventive and curative strategies are available to tackle some of these infections, efforts at the international and national levels must be made to implement those and thus reduce their burden in resource-limited countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND The Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz (MIOC) is one of the first scientific journals created in Brazil and currently one of the most important biomedical journals in South America. Knowledge of the main themes disseminated over time and its main contributors can contribute towards a better understanding of its trajectory and future.
   OBJECTIVES Map the journal's scientific publication between 1909 and 2020.
   METHODS Data from three scientific databases was combined, alongside bibliometrics and network analysis to analyse publication records between 1909 and 2020.
   FINDINGS Publications increased substantially since the 1980s. The main publishing organisations are Brazilian. Excluding Brazil, the main publishing countries are the USA, Argentina, and Colombia. During the entire investigated period, the main themes refer to Chagas disease, schistosomiasis, and Leishmaniasis. During some periods, publications followed disease outbreaks in Brazil (e.g., dengue fever and yellow fever).
   MAIN CONCLUSIONS Since its foundation in 1909, the MIOC has focused on infectious and parasitic diseases. The editorial changes implemented from the 1980s onwards led MIOC to a relevant growth concerning annual publications and its transformation into an important communication vehicle for researchers from several Brazilian organisations besides Fiocruz, as well as organisations from other countries, especially within Latin America.

AB  - Hemoparasites are vector-borne parasites that infect wild carnivores worldwide. Since data on hemoparasite infections in Nasua nasua from Brazil are lacking, the aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of hemoparasites and ectoparasites in N. nasua from different areas of Brazil. Blood samples and ectoparasites from 83 N. nasua were collected in Botucatu, Palmital, and So Paulo municipalities. Samples were screened via microscopy and molecular methods to detect hemoparasites. Tissues from two N. nasua were obtained for histopathological and molecular analyses. All 83 samples were negative for piroplasms on morphological and molecular examination. Thin blood smears of nine animals were positive for Hepatozoon gamonts. The gamonts shared morphological characteristics of Hepatozoon procyonis. Meronts were detected in the liver and spleen tissue of one animal. Twenty-one blood samples and four tissue samples were PCR positive for Hepatozoon sp. The sequences obtained were 97% identical to those of Hepatozoon felis, Hepatozoon ursi, and Hepatozoon sp. Based on searches for similarity and morphology, we identified the sequences as belonging to H. procyonis. This study provides epidemiological data on hemoparasite infections and redescribe H. procyonis based on morphological, morphometrical, and molecular analyses.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the recent decades, a global effort from food suppliers, industries, and governments has ensured that food production would meet the high quality required by the sanitary authorities, minimizing public health implications and economic losses caused by food-borne diseases.
   BACKGROUND: Several programmes and initiatives have been developed worldwide both by government agencies and the private sector to achieve this goal. Food-borne diseases, caused by pathogens, natural toxins, and chemical contaminants, remain a global public health challenge, since new threats are continuously emerging while others are being controlled. Also, in many countries, the consumption of food prepared outside the home increases the exposure to the risks posed by poor hygiene in food service. In this context, a reliable sanitary surveillance system is urgently needed to identify potential hazards, conduct risk analysis, and control food-borne diseases outbreaks worldwide.
   BRAZILIAN SAFETY POLICIES AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS: Brazil national agencies are tasked with controlling the hazards in the food chain by means of federal regulations based on a set of global sanitary authorities' guidelines.
   CONCLUSION: The occurrence of food-borne diseases, control measures, policies, and regulatory frameworks in Brazil drawn to ensure the quality and safety of food are presented in this paper.

AB  - Aims Although an increasing prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) has been reported worldwide, there are few studies from low-and middle-income countries. Our objective is to assess the prevalence of AF and the associated medical conditions in Brazilian primary care patients.
   Methods and results This is an observational retrospective study. Patients >= 5 years of age from primary care centres of 658 municipalities in Minas Gerais, Brazil, who performed digital electrocardiograms (ECGs) by a public telehealth service in 2011 were assessed. Clinical data were self-reported, and ECGs were interpreted by a team of trained cardiologists using standardized criteria. To assess the relation between clinical characteristics and AF, odds ratios were estimated by logistic regression. A total of 262 685 primary care patients were included, mean (SD) age of 50.3 (19.3) years, 59.6% female. Hypertension was reported in 32.0%, family history of coronary heart disease in 15.0%, diabetes in 5.4%, hyperlipidaemia in 2.8%, Chagas disease in 2.9%, and 7.1% reported current smoking. The prevalence of AF was 1.8% overall: 2.4% in men (ranging from 0.001% from 5 19 years old to 14.6% in nonagenarians) and 1.3% in women (ranging from 0.001% from 5-19 years old to 8.7% in nonagenarians) (P<0.001). The prevalence of AF increased with advancing age. The comorbidities associated with AF were Chagas disease, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Vitamin K antagonist use was reported by 1.5% of patients.
   Conclusion The prevalence and age distribution of AF were similar to studies in high-income countries. The proportion of patients who reported the use of anticoagulants was alarmingly low. Our findings point out the necessity to formulate effective treatment strategies for AF in Brazilian primary care settings.

AB  - Trypanosomatids are uniflagellate protozoa belonging to the Trypanosomatidae family. The genera Trypanosoma and Leishmania are of paramount importance as they contain species that cause serious diseases, such as Chagas disease and Leishmaniasis, respectively. The objective of the present study was to identify trypanosomatids present in the whole blood of free-living and captive neotropical primates in Mato Grosso State, Midwest Brazil. Between 2017 and 2019, 38 blood samples were collected from seven different neotropical primate species in seven cities in the state. Through molecular techniques, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify a fragment of the kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) gene, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis, nine Leishmania spp. [seven L. infantum and two L. (Leishmania) amazonensis] and two Trypanosoma spp. (T. minasense and T. rangeli) were identified. This study contributes to understanding the occurrence and epidemiology of trypanosomatids in Mato Grosso State and the importance of neotropical primates as trypanosome hosts and possible infection sources for other animals and humans. Future identification of other blood pathogens in neotropical primates will assist in disease control and prevention strategies.

AB  - Knowledge about epidemiological distribution patterns of HIV infection in different geographic regions is relevant to understand the dynamics of the disease in Brazil. This study aims to characterize the epidemiological and clinical profile of HIV-infected patients from Southwestern Goias State, from 2005 to 2015. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect clinical-epidemiological, virological, and immunological data from the medical records of all HIV-infected patients (n=539) who were followed at the regional reference center of Jatai, Goias State, Brazil, from 2005 to 2015. We detected the prevalence of male patients and the heterosexual route of transmission, as well as an expressive number of young women infected with HIV. The HIV infection was more prevalent in reproductive ages (55.3%). Most patients presented clinical manifestations related to HIV infection at the time of diagnosis. Twenty-four patients presented coinfection with hepatitis C virus, syphilis, hepatitis B virus, leprosy or Chagas disease. Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii was the most common opportunistic infection, followed by neurotoxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and neurocryptococcosis. Combined antiretroviral therapy improved CD4+ T-cell counts: the mean CD4+ T-cell counts after treatment was twice as high as those found at the first medical appointment; and highly active antiretroviral therapy promoted viral suppression in a significant number of patients. Considering the increasing distribution of HIV infection to the interior of Brazil, this descriptive study outlines the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of HIV infection in Southwestern Goias and contributes to develop local prevention strategies and public service plans.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this work was evaluate the cytotoxic, leishmanicidal and tripanocidal activity, as well as to evaluate its antimicrobial and modulatory activity in association with different antibiotics of the hydroethanolic extract of the Ximenia Americana stem bark (EHXA).
   Method: In vitro tests against Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania sp. and citotoxicity were performed. The evaluation of the antibacterial and bacterial resistance modulatory effect was given by the microdilution method.
   Results: The chemical profile show different classes of compounds with significant presence of quercetrin and caffeic acid. The EHXA demonstrated activity only in the concentration of 1000 mu g/mL against the L. infantum and L. brasiliensis promastigotes, causing mortality percentage of 40.66 and 27.62%, respectively. The extract presented a significant toxicity only in the concentration of 1000 mu g/mL, causing a mortality of 55.42% of fibroblasts. The antibacterial activity of the EHXA demonstrated a MIC value >= 1024 mu g/mL against all the tested bacteria. However, in the modulation assay with EHXA in association with different antibiotics the extract had a synergistic effect against S. aureus strains when associated with norfloxacin.
   Conclusion: The results of this investigation demonstrate for the first time the chemical composition of the hydroethanolic extract of the Ximenia Americana stem bark, your potential antiparasitic and modulatory effect. The low cytotoxic and biological potential against S. aureus open therapeutic perspectives against leishmaniosis and bacterial infections.

AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) constitutes the most prevalent sexually transmitted bacterium worldwide. Chlamydial infections can lead to severe clinical sequelae including pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and tuba! infertility. As an obligate intracellular pathogen, Ct has evolved multiple strategies to promote adhesion and invasion of host cells, including those involving both bacterial and host glycans. Here, we show that galectin-1 (Gall), an endogenous lectin widely expressed in female and male genital tracts, promotes Ct infection. Through glycosylation-dependent mechanisms involving recognition of bacterial glycoproteins and N-glycosylated host cell receptors, Gall enhanced Ct attachment to cervical epithelial cells. Exposure to Gall, mainly in its dimeric form, facilitated bacterial entry and increased the number of infected cells by favoring Ct-Ct and Ct-host cell interactions. These effects were substantiated in vivo in mice lacking Gall or complex 01-6-branched Nglycans. Thus, disrupting Gall-N-glycan interactions may limit the severity of chlamydial infection by inhibiting bacterial invasion of host cells.

AB  - Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is an important cause of severe neurological disease mainly in low- and middle income countries, but data on NCC mortality from endemic areas are scarce. Here we analysed the epidemiological patterns of NCC-related mortality in Brazil. We included all deaths recorded in Brazil between 2000 and 2011, in which NCC was mentioned on death certificates, either as underlying or as associated cause of death. NCC was identified in 1829/12,491,280 deaths (0.015%), 1130 (61.8%) as underlying cause, and 699 (38.2%) as associated cause. Overall age-adjusted mortality rate for the period was 0.97 deaths/1,000,000 inhabitants (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-1.12). The highest NCC-related mortality rates were found in males, elderly, white race/colour and residents in endemic states/regions. Age-adjusted mortality rates at national level decreased significantly over time (annual percent change [APC]: -4.7; 95% CI: -6.0 to -3.3), with a decrease in the Southeast, South and Central-West regions, and a non-significant increasing trend in the North and Northeast regions. We identified spatial and spatiotemporal high-risk mortality clusters located mainly in NCC-endemic areas. Conditions related to the nervous system were the most commonly associated causes of death when NCC was mentioned as an underlying cause, and HIV/AIDS was the main underlying cause when NCC was an associated cause. NCC is a neglected and preventable cause of severe neurologic disease and death with high public health impact in Brazil. There is a clear need to strengthen nationwide epidemiological surveillance and control for the taeniasis/cysticercosis complex. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by protozoa of the Leishmania genus. It may manifest in visceral and tegumentary forms, and pentavalent antimonials are the first choice drugs used for the treatment. Frequently these drugs show low efficiency and high toxicity to mammalian host. The present study describes the chemical profile and the in vitro leishmanicidal effects of red propolis and Dalbergia ecastaphyllum extracts from Sergipe, Brazil, in Leishmania chagasi and Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes. The phenolic composition of the extracts was evaluated by direct infusion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) fingerprinting. The leishmanicidal effect was evaluated by the Resazurin colorimetric method. Similar composition profiles have been found for D. ecastaphyllum and propolis samples. The isoflavones formononetin, biochanin A, daidzein and pinocembrin were identified in both extracts. Propolis extract showed leishmanicidal activity in both L. chagasi and L. amazonensis, with IC50 values of 21.54 and 9.73 mu g/mL, respectively. The D. ecastaphyllum extract presented activity only in L. amazonensis, with IC50 of 53.42 mu g/mL. These results suggest that red propolis extract from Sergipe has the leguminosae D. ecastaphyllum as botanical origin, and that it presents potential leishmanicidal activity, which may be associated with the presence of the phenolic compounds found in its composition.

AB  - The increase in life expectancy and the migration of individuals with Chagas disease (ChD) from rural to urban centers exposes them to the development of chronic-degenerative abnormalities that may increase the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS). The present study aimed to identify the prevalence of MetS and its components in individuals with chronic ChD. This is a cross-sectional study with 361 patients of both sexes, aging >18 years, followed at a national reference center (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). MetS diagnosis followed the International Diabetes Federation 2005 criteria. The association between the variables was determined through logistic regression models. The mean age was and 60.7 +/- 10.8 years. About half (56.2%) were female and the majority self-reported their race as mulatto (59.8%). The percentage of individuals with MetS was 40.4%. The variables independently associated with MetS were age (OR 1.06; 95%CI 1.04-1.09), high education levels (OR 0.36; 95%CI 0.17-0.79) and cardiac form with heart failure (OR 0.34; 95%CI 0.17-0.68). Therefore, a high prevalence of MetS was found in this Brazilian chronic ChD cohort. The identification of the associated factors can facilitate the development of effective approaches for preventing and managing MetS in ChD patients.

This species is employed in folk medicine as giardicidal, amoebicidal and to treat digestive disorders. The present paper describes the isolation and structure determination of a new furanoheliangolide sesquiterpene lactone named 11,13-dihydroxy-calaxin, in addition to seven known compounds: ethyl caffeate, vanillin, 12-hydroxy-encecalin, phytol, 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid and 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid from the ethanol extract of C. pinnatifida leaves. Additionally, 11,13-dihydroxy-calaxin, vanillin, 12-hydroxy-encecalin, phytol, 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid, 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid and the mixture of 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic, 3,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic and 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic acids were assayed against the amastigote forms of Leishmania amazonensis and Trypanosoma cruzi, and the sesquiterpene lactone 11,13-dihydroxy-calaxin exhibited a promising trypanocidal and leishmanicidal activity, displaying IC50 values of 5.27 and 8.30 mu M, respectively.

AB  - Context: Benznidazole (BNZ) is an antiparasitic with trypanocidal properties for the etiological treatment of Chagas disease since 1973. Monitoring the stability of this drug is one of the most effective methods of assessment, forecasting and prevention of problems related to quality product.
   Objective: To investigate the direct and indirect photodegradation of BNZ and to evaluate the interference of the excipients used in the forms dosage solid as well as to shed light on the chemical structure of the degradation products obtained.
   Materials and methods: To perform this work we adopted the "ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline: Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products Q1B" (Guideline Q1B). We used benzonidazole (BNZ) (N-benzil-2-(2-nitroimidazol-1-il) acetamide) (LAFEPE (R), Recife, Brazil) and various excipients; beyond high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), infrared spectroscopy (IR) and mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The indirect photodegradation of BNZ was carried out using physical mixtures with 13 pharmaceutical excipients commonly used in the preparation of solid dosage forms.
   Results: HPLC and MS/MS techniques were selected for the identification of two photoproducts (PPs) and photoreactions found in direct and indirect tests with the microcrystalline cellulose, considered a critical excipient.
   Discussion: Despite variations in the infrared spectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry and differential thermogravimetry curves, these techniques are not conclusive since the study of photodegradation of the drug caused decay of 30%, according to the ICH.
   Conclusions: The results show that BNZ only undergoes direct photodegradation, since no new PPs were found for a combination of the drug and excipients.

AB  - Two years ago, we held an exciting event entitled the Sao Paulo School of Advanced Sciences on Vaccines (SPSASV). Sixty-eight Ph.D. students, postdoctoral fellows and independent researchers from 37 different countries met at the Mendes Plaza Hotel located in the city of Santos, SP - Brazil to discuss the challenges and the new frontiers of vaccinology. The SPSASV provided a critical and comprehensive view of vaccine research from basics to the current state-of-the-art techniques performed worldwide. For 10 days, we discussed all the aspects of vaccine development in 36 lectures, 53 oral presentations and 2 poster sessions. At the end of the course, participants were further encouraged to present a model of a grant proposal related to vaccine development against individual pathogens. Among the targeted pathogens were viruses (Chikungunya, HIV, RSV, and Influenza), bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Streptococcus pyogenes), parasites (Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax), and the worm Strongyloides stercoralis. This report highlights some of the knowledge shared at the SPSASV.

AB  - HPLC-UV-ELSD-MS-guided fractionation of the anti-parasitic extract obtained from the marine sponge Monanchora arbuscula, collected off the southeastern coast of Brazil, led to the isolation of a series of guanidine and pyrimidine alkaloids. The pyrimidines monalidine A (1) and arbusculidine A (7), as well as the guanidine alkaloids batzellamide A (8) and hemibatzelladines 9-11, represent new minor constituents that were identified by analysis of spectroscopic data. The total synthesis of monalidine A confirmed its structure. Arbusculidine A (7), related to the ptilocaulin/mirabilin/netamine family of tricyclic guanidine alkaloids, is the first in this family to possess a benzene ring. Batzellamide A (8) and hemibatzelladines 9-11 represent new carbon skeletons that are related to the batzelladines. Evaluation of the anti-parasitic activity of the major known metabolites, batzelladines D (12), F (13), L (14), and nor-L (15), as well as of synthetic monalidine A (1), against Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania infantum is also reported, along with a detailed investigation of parasite cell-death pathways promoted by batzelladine L (14) and norbatzelladine L (15).

AB  - Leptospirosis is a common worldwide bacterial zoonosis and has been studied in One Health approaches. Small mammals are described as the most important maintenance reservoirs of several pathogens in nature, including leptospires. The aim of this study was to identify infection by leptospires among small mammals on the Atlantic forest biome and evaluate their potential as carriers of these spirochetes. A total of 153 small mammals belonging to orders Rodentia and Didelphimorphia (distributed on 17 genera and 22 species) were captured. Blood and kidney samples were collected from animals and a conventional PCR targeted on lipL32 gene was conducted on renal tissues. Species identification was performed in eight samples by sequencing of rrs gene. A total of 28% of the animals presented lipL32 PCR-positive, and four pathogenic Leptospira species (L. interrogans, L. borgpetersenii, L. santarosai and L. noguchii) were identified. This study highlights the role of small mammals as carriers of leptospires on the Atlantic Forest representing a potential source of pathogenic Leptospira spp infection for both humans and domestic animals.

AB  - Coprolites analyses are important to determine the diet and behavioral habits of ancient populations. This study aimed the macroscopic and microscopic examination of a coprolite from the trusteeship of the Archeologic Laboratory of the Goiano Institute of Prehistory and Anthropology (IGPA) from the Pontific University of Goias (PUC), dated from 1985 years B.C. according to the archeological registers of a site located in the Mid-Western region of Brazil. For the macroscopic analyses of the coprolite the sample was weighed and analyzed under a stereoscopic microscope. For the microscopic analyses the sample was rehydrated and parasitologically analyzed under an optic light microscope. The macroscopic analyses detected vegetal, arthropod, Mollusca, vertebrate and fungi remains. While the microscopic one detected Enterobius vermicularis eggs. This is the first finding of E. vermicularis in a paleoparasitological analysis of a coprolite from the Mid-West region of Brazil, dated from the pre-Columbian period. It was possible to detect several indications of an omnivorous diet from the individual who lived in this region in the period of 1985 years B.C. and also the detection of E. vermicularis, which strongly indicated that the analyzed coprolite may have come from a human.

AB  - Chagas disease is most frequently transmitted to humans through contact with feces of insects from the Triatominae subfamily. In Brazil, there are 65 species of triatomines distributed throughout the country's 27 states. Among the species in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Triatoma rubrovaria, Triatoma oliveirai, Triatoma pintodiasi, Triatoma klugi, Triatoma carcavalloi, and Triatoma circummaculata (with the addition Triatoma limai, which is endemic to Argentina) form the T. rubrovaria subcomplex. The last species described and grouped into this subcomplex was T. pintodiasi. Thus, this study characterized the genetic distance between T. pintodiasi and of the other members of the T. rubrovaria subcomplex to evaluate the specific status of T. pintodiasi. The genetic distance observed between T. pintodiasi and the other species of the T. rubrovaria subcomplex was large, a finding which highlights the specific status of the species considered to be cryptic of T. circummaculata.

AB  - Purpose Trypanosoma caninum exhibits atypical epimastigote forms under axenic conditions. This study aimed to analyze this evolutionary form under different cultivation conditions and provide more information about this evolutionary form. Methods We selected a T. caninum isolate with a high percentage of aflagellar epimastigote forms in axenic cultures. Two separate growth curves were generated for T. caninum cultured in Schneider axenic medium and co-cultured with the DH82 cell line, followed by analysis and quantification of evolutionary forms using bright field microscopy. In addition, ultrastructural analysis of T. caninum was performed under both cultivation conditions. Results The growth curves of T. caninum under axenic and co-cultivation conditions exhibited similar profiles. However, in the axenic culture, the number of parasites was three times higher at the peak of the exponential phase than in the co-culture. In contrast to that in the axenic culture, in which only the epimastigote forms were observed along the entire curve, during co-cultivation with the DH82 cell line, differentiation was observed for the trypomastigote and spheromastigote forms in low proportions. These results demonstrated that when cultured alone, the T. caninum isolate preserved the aflagellar epimastigote form, but in the presence of DH82 canine macrophages, they differentiated into evolutionary forms, particularly trypomastigote forms. Moreover, this study is the first to describe the presence of lipid bodies, structure described as the parasite's nutritional reserve, throughout the body of T. caninum. Conclusions These findings describe biological and ultrastructural aspects of epimastigote aflagellar and suggest that this evolutionary form may be involved in the biological cycle of T. caninum, still unknown.

AB  - Background: Chagas disease (CD) remains an important endemic disease in Latin America. However, CD became globalized in recent decades. The majority of the chronically infected individuals did not receive etiologic treatment for several reasons, among them the most conspicuous is the lack of access to diagnosis. The impact of trypanocidal treatment on CD chronic phase, without cardiac involvement (indeterminate form ICF), is yet to be determined. We aimed to evaluate the effect of trypanocidal treatment with benznidazole (BZN) on the rate of progression to Chagas heart disease in patients with ICF.
   Methods: This is a retrospective cohort observational study including patients with ICF treated with BZN and compared to a group of non-treated patients matched for age, sex, region of origin, and the year of cohort entry. We reviewed the medical charts of all patients followed from May 1987 to June 2020 at the outpatient center of the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INI) of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Patients' follow-up included at least one annual medical visit and one annual electrocardiogram (ECG). Echocardiographic exams were performed at baseline and during the follow-up. Disease progression from ICF to cardiac form was defined by changes in baseline ECG. Cumulative incidence and the incidence rate were described in the incidence analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between BZN and CD progression, cardiovascular events or death.
   Findings: One hundred and fourteen treated patients met the study inclusion criteria. A comparison group of 114 non-treated patients matched for age, sex, region of origin, and the year of cohort entry was also included, totalizing 228 patients. Most patients included in the study were male (70.2%), and their mean age was 31.3 (+7.4) years. Over a median follow-up of 15.1 years (ranging from 1.0 to 32.4), the cumulative CD progression incidence in treated patients was 7.9% vs. 21.1% in the non-treated group (p = 0.04) and the CD progression rate was 0.49 per 1.000 patients/year in treated patients vs. 1.10 per 1.000 patients/year for non-treated patients (p = 0.02). BZN treatment was associated with a decreased risk of CD progression in both unadjusted (HR 0.46; 95%CI 0.21 to 0.98) and adjusted (HR 0.43; 95%CI 0.19 to 0.96) models and with a decreased risk of occurrence of the composite of cardiovascular events only in the adjusted (HR 0.15; 95%CI 0.03 to 0.80) model. No association was observed between BZN treatment and mortality.
   Interpretation: In a long-term follow-up, BZN treatment was associated with a decreased incidence of CD progression from ICF to the cardiac form and also with a decreased risk of cardiovascular events. Therefore, our results indicate that BZN treatment for CD patients with ICF should be implemented into clinical practice. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Nobel Prize was created by Alfred Nobel. The first prize was awarded in 1901 and Emil Adolf von Behring was the first laureate in medicine due to his research in diphtheria serum. Regarding cardiology, Nobel Prize's history permits a global comprehension of progress in pathophysiolog,y, diagnosis and therapeutics of various cardiac diseases in last 120 years. The objective of this study was to review the major scientific discoveries contemplated by Nobel Prizes that contributed to cardiology. In addition, we also hypothesized why Carlos Chagas, one of our most important scientists, did not win the prize in two occasions. We carried out a non-systematic review of Nobel Prize winners, selecting the main studies relevant to heart diseaseamong the laureates. In the period between 1 901 and 2013, 204 researches and 104 prizes were awarded in Nobel Prize, of which 16 (15%) studies were important for cardiovascular area. There were 33 (16%) laureates, and two (6%) were women. Fourteen (42%) were American, 15 (45%) Europeans arid four (13%) were frorn oilier countries. There was only one winner born in Brazil, Peter Medawar, whose career was all in England. Reviewing the history of the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine area made possible to identify which researchers and studies had contributed to advances in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Most winners were North Americans and Europeans, and male.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify the composition of the essential oil from leaves of Lippia sidoides (EOLS), a typical shrub commonly found in the dry northeast of Brazil, popularly known as "alecrim-pimenta". Additionally, we investigated the nymphicidal, ovicidal, phagoinhibitory and excretion effects of EOLS, its major constituent thymol and its isomer carvacrol, on fourth instar nymphs and eggs of Rhodnius prolixus, the Chagas' disease vector. The nymphicidal and ovicidal activity of thymol, carvacrol, and EOLS was assessed by tests using impregnated Petri dishes. The lethal concentration values (LC50) for EOLS, carvacrol, and thymol were 54.48, 32.98, and 9.38 mg/cm(2), respectively. The ovicidal test showed that both carvacrol and thymol (50 mg/cm(2)) inhibited hatching (50% and 23.3%, respectively), while treatments with 10 mg/cm(2) or 50 mg/cm(2) EOLS did not affect the hatching rate at all (80% and 90%, respectively). We observed an anti-feeding effect in insects fed with blood containing natural products at the higher concentrations (100 mu g/mL). Finally, excretion rate was affected by EOLS and carvacrol, but not by thymol. These findings offer novel insights into basic physiological processes that make the tested natural compounds interesting candidates for new types of insecticides.

AB  - The Triatoma brasiliensis complex is composed of six species (Triatoma bahiensis, T. juazerensis, T. lenti, T. melanica, T. petrocchiae, and T. sherlocki) and two subspecies (T. brasiliensis brasiliensis and T. b. macromelasoma). Phylogenetic studies have shown that it is a monophyletic group, but the morphological relationships among the members can be better understood. We applied a tool of high resolution based on morphology to identify details that characterize the female genitals for each member of this group. The external genital structures of five to fifteen females of each taxon were analyzed. Insects had their abdomen transversely cut to separate the last abdominal segments, and representative illustrations obtained via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are shown. Observations were performed in the dorsal and the ventral views. The morphological characterization of female external genitalia allowed a differentiation of each species/subspecies. The subspecies T. b. brasiliensis and T. b. macromelasoma were the most similar. On the other hand, dorsal view of structures evidenced some unique characteristics for T. petrocchiae and T. sherlocki. Regarding these structures for T. petrocchiae, the differentiation was in accordance with molecular studies, since this species exhibits the highest genetic distances in relation to other species of T. brasiliensis complex.

AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania braziliensis is the most spread clinical form of leishmaniasis in Brazil. However, only a few part of the people infected develop clinically perceptive disease, suggesting the influence of human genetic components in the CL pathogeny. The rs2275913 SNP is the nucleotide variant of the IL17A gene. The A allele is associated with a vast number of infectious and non-infectious diseases. Here, we investigated the association of the rs2275913 SNP (G/A) from IL-17A and two forms of susceptibility to CL in Brazil by case-control study. Furthermore, we evaluated the functional relevance of this SNP during the immune response of the host and analyzed its impact in the parasite elimination. Weak associations of A allele with susceptibility to L. braziliensis infection or to symptomatic CL were observed, and a tendency of A allele carriers to be more susceptible to infection and cutaneous disease. Functional analysis of the Th17 cell phenotypes revealed lower frequencies of CD4 + IL-17+ cells in samples of infected people with AA/AG genotypes. Furthermore, people carrying the A allele maintain higher parasite loads, reinforcing the genetic susceptibility findings. This study adds knowledge about the influence of a significant genetic variation on IL-17 promoter on CL pathogenesis, and may contribute to enhance the knowledge about the role of IL-17 in the L. braziliensis infections.

AB  - Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoan that causes human trichomoniasis, the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection (STI) affecting approximately 278 million people worldwide. The current treatment for trichomoniasis is based on 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole, known as metronidazole (MTZ). Although effective in clearing the parasite infection, MTZ is related to provoking severe side effects, and it is not recommended during pregnancy. In addition, some strains present resistance to 5'-nitroimidazoles, making urgent the development of alternative drugs for trichomoniasis. Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic drug, exerts a significant anti-parasite effect, mainly due to its interference with calcium homeostasis and the biosynthesis of sterols. Therefore, we decided to test the effect of amiodarone and two other related compounds (amioder and dronedarone) on T. vaginalis. Our observations show that amiodarone stimulated, rather than inhibited, parasite growth, induced cell aggregation, and glycogen accumulation. Furthermore, the other two compounds displayed anti-parasite activity with IC50 of 3.15 and 11 mu M, respectively, and the apoptosis-like process killed the cells. In addition, cells exhibited morphological changes, including an effect on hydrogenosomes structure.

AB  - Introduction: Triatoma lenti and Triatoma sherlocki are endemic species of the State of Bahia, located in northeastern Brazil, where they have records of domiciliation in the human environment. In view of the epidemiological aspect and taxonomic importance of these species for the systematics of the Triatoma genus, a study was carried out with nymphs of all five instars. Methods: An extensive review of studies on nymphs from the subfamily Triatominae is presented. Morphology was studied using a scanning electron microscope and morphometric analyses. Results: The morphological study allowed us to characterize and discriminate species by means of scanning electron microscope of the last abdominal segment. In addition, the results show morphometric variability, with the total size of the head that best discriminates the species. Conclusions: Studies on nymphs are fundamental to the ecosystem; however, the literature on the immature forms of certain groups is scarce, difficult to use, or nonexistent. Therefore, this study includes morphological and morphometric data of the nymphal instars of T. lend and T. sherlocki, corroborating the specific taxonomy of these species.

AB  - The plant family Amaryllidaceae is well-known for its unique alkaloid constituents, which exhibit a wide range of biological activities. Its representative, Amaryllis belladonna, has a geographical distribution covering mainly southern Africa, where it has significant usage in the traditional medicine of the native people. In this study, A. belladonna samples collected in Brazil were examined for alkaloid content. Alkaloid profiles of A. belladonna bulbs were generated by a combination of chromatographic, spectroscopic and spectrometric methods, including GC-MS and 2D NMR. In vitro screening against four different parasitic protozoa (Trypanosoma cruzi, T. brucei rhodesiense, Leishmania donovani and Plasmodium falciparum) was carried out using the A. belladonna crude methanol extract, as well as three of its alkaloid isolates. Twenty-six different Amaryllidaceae alkaloids were identified in the A. belladonna bulb samples, and three of them were isolated. Evidence for their respective biosynthetic pathways was afforded via their mass-spectral fragmentation data. Improved data for 1-O-acetylcaranine was provided by 2D NMR experiments, together with new H-1-NMR data for buphanamine. The crude extract and 3-O-acetylhamayne exhibited good antiprotozoal activity in vitro, although both with a high cytotoxic index.

AB  - In the early decades of the twentieth century, when health started becoming an issue on the political agenda, Arthur Neiva and Belisario Penna travelled to the sertao semi-arid region of Goias state, Brazil, to diagnose the population's state of health, particularly highlighting the spread of Chagas disease and the decadence of the sertao. The political elite in the state reacted to the sanitarians' findings. This article observes the controversy played out in the pages of A Informacao Goiana magazine. The publication supported the region's interests, because its leaders were sure that it was down to the people of Goias to reveal the truth about the sertao, its people, and its potentialities.

AB  - Previous research on innovation capabilities in emerging economies shows knowledge networks tied to Western multinationals and national governments focused on economic growth. Less understood is the innovation capability building of emerging economies to achieve 'good health', an important Sustainable Development Goal. Here, we present a longitudinal study of a public research organization in an emerging economy and examine how it builds innovation capabilities for creating vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics for diseases primarily affecting the poor. We study FIOCRUZ in Brazil using archival, patent, and interview data about invention of technologies for neglected tropical diseases. We contribute novel insights into the evolution of knowledge networks, as national policy integrates innovation and health goals. We found significant diversification of local and foreign knowledge sources, and substantial creation of networks with public, private, and non-governmental organizations enabling collective invention. These R&D networks attract many multinationals to collaborate on socially driven innovation projects previously non-existent in their portfolios. The public research organization leads collaborations with multinationals and diverse partners, harnessing distributed international knowledge. Our results indicate emerging economies' capabilities depend on elevating policies to increase health access for the poor to drive innovation and promoting local R&D to generate solutions to improve health.

AB  - Triatoma bahiensis Sherlock & Serafim, 1967, T. lenti Sherlock & Serafim, 1967, and T. pessoai Sherlock & Serafim, 1967 were described based on material collected in the Brazilian state of Bahia. These species were later included in the T. brasiliensis complex based on their geographic distribution. Triatoma bahiensis and T. pessoai were subsequently synonymized with T. lenti. However, the phylogenetic position of T. lenti within the T. brasiliensis complex has remained doubtful. This study aims to assess the taxonomic status of T. bahiensis and to infer the phylogenetic relationships between T. lenti, T. bahiensis and the other members of the T. brasiliensis species complex. The identities of the species in concern were confirmed by comparisons with high resolution photos of the respective type materials; lectotypes are designated for T. pessoai and T. bahiensis. Morphological, morphometric, molecular, and cytogenetic approaches as well as experimental crosses were used. The low viability of experimental crosses combined with morphological and morphometric data allow the differentiation of T. bahiensis and T. lenti. Pairwise cyt b sequence divergence between T. lenti and T. bahiensis was 2.5%. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses grouped T. lenti and T. bahiensis as members of the T. brasiliensis complex. These results revalidate the specific status of T. bahiensis.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate factors associated with orthostatic hypotension in 14,833 individuals 35-74 years of age. This was a cross-sectional study of baseline data (2008-2010) from the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). Postural testing was performed after 20 minutes resting in supine position and active adoption of orthostatic posture. Blood pressure was measured in supine position and at 3 minutes in orthostatic position with an oscillometer (HEM 705 CP, Omron, Sao Paulo, Brazil). Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a drop of >= 20mmHg in systolic blood pressure and/or a drop of >= 10mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. The target covariates were sex, age bracket, race/color, schooling, nutritional status, waist circumference, alteration in the ankle-brachial index, pulse wave velocity, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes, use of antihypertensives, cholesterol, triglycerides, Chagas disease serology, symptoms, and heart rate variation in the postural test, self-reported heart disease, acute myocardial infarction (AMI)/revascularization, and stroke. Orthostatic hypotension was significantly associated with higher age bracket, OR = 1.83 (95%CI: 1.14-295); alteration in the ankle-brachial index, OR = 2.8 (95%CI: 1.13-6.88); AMI/revascularization, OR = 1.70 (95%CI: 1.01-2.87); report of heart disease, OR = 3.03 (95%CI: 1.71-5.36); increased systolic blood pressure, OR = 1.012 (95%CI: 1.006-1.019); positive Chagas disease serology, OR = 2.29 (95%CI: 1.23-4.27); and occurrence of symptoms with postural change, OR = 20.81 (95%CI: 14.81-29.24). Presence of orthostatic hypotension can be a warning sign for cardiovascular disorders and thus a useful tool for screening and prevention.

AB  - Background: Heart transplant is the main therapeutic alternative for advanced heart failure patients. Several risk factors affect these patients' survival; however, few studies about the topic are available in Brazil.
   Objectives: To review the survival rates of heart transplant patients in the Brazilian Public Health System (Sistema Unico de Saude - SUS) between 2000 and 2015.
   Methods: This is a non-concurrent, open cohort study, involving cardiac transplant patients in Brazil. The cumulative survival probability was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier curve, and the curve comparison was done using the Log-Rank test. The Cox model was used to calculate the Hazard-Ratio (HR). Analyses were conducted at the 95% confidence level.
   Results: The heart transplant survival rate median in Brazil, during the period, was 8.3 years. Each additional year in the recipient's age, the occurrence of infections, and the performance of the surgical procedure in the South Region were associated with a higher risk of graft loss. A higher use ratio of immunosuppressants mycophenolate and azathioprine acted as a protection factor.
   Conclusions: The analyses conducted provide the first information about the median survival time in heart transplant patients in Brazil. The difference noticed among the geographical regions may be related to the different treatment protocols adopted in the country, especially in the early 2000s. The rate of mycophenolate and azathioprine use as a protection factor suggests that, despite the absence of differences among therapeutic strategies, use of these drugs may favor survival of certain patients. The study provides robust epidemiological data, which are relevant for public health.

AB  - Spatial patterns studies are of great interest to the scientific community and the spatial scan statistic is a widely used technique to analyze such patterns. A key point for the construction of methods for detection of irregularly shaped clusters is that, as the geometrical shape has more degrees of freedom, some correction should be employed in order to compensate the increased flexibility. This paper proposed a multi-objective approach to cluster detection problem using the Particle Swarm Optimization technique aggregating a novel penalty function, called dispersion function, allowing only clusters which are subsets of a circular zone of moderate size. Compared to other regularity functions, the multi-objective scan with the dispersion function is faster and suited for the detection of moderately irregularly shaped clusters. An application is presented using state-wide data for Chagas' disease in puerperal women in Minas Gerais state, Brazil.

AB  - Panstrongylus megistus, a potential vector of Chagas disease, currently occupies a wider geographic distribution in Brazil than Triatoma infestans, another member of the hemipteran Reduviidae family and a vector of the same disease. A small heterochromatic body (chromocenter) formed by the Y chromosome is evident in the somatic cells of P. megistus, differing in size and chromosome type contribution from the well-studied chromocenters present in T. infestans. While the overall distribution of histone epigenetic marks differ when comparing the heterochromatin and euchromatin territories in T. infestans, no similar data have been established for other hemipteran reduviids, including P. megistus. In the present work, histone acetylation and methylation marks were investigated in cells of Malpighian tubules of P. megistus 5th instar nymphs using immunocytochemical assays and compared to previously published data for T. infestans. Although similarities between these species were found regarding absence of acetylated H3K9, H4K8 and H4K16, and H3K9me and H3K9me(2) in the chromocenter, presence of these marks in euchromatin, and presence of H3K9me(3) in the chromocenter, no intimate association of acetylated H4K8 and 18S rDNA was revealed in the chromocenter of P. megistus. The elevated abundance of H3K9me(2) marks at the nuclear periphery in P. megistus cells, differing from data for T. infestans, is suggested to reflect differences in the interaction of lamina-associated chromatin domains with the nuclear lamina, methyl-transferase modulation and/or association with the last DNA endoreplication step in 5th instar nymphs, which is a matter for further investigation.

AB  - Background
   The effectiveness of anti-parasite treatment with benznidazole in the chronic Chagas disease (ChD) remains uncertain. We evaluated, using data from the NIH-sponsored SaMi-Trop prospective cohort study, if previous treatment with benznidazole is associated with lower mortality, less advanced cardiac disease and lower parasitemia in patients with chronic ChD.
   Methods
   The study enrolled 1,959 ChD patients and abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) from in 21 remote towns in Brazil. A total of 1,813 patients were evaluated at baseline and after two years of follow-up. Those who received at least one course of benznidazole were classified as treated group (TrG = 493) and those who were never treated as control group (CG = 1,320). The primary outcome was death after two-year follow-up; the secondary outcomes were presence at the baseline of major ChD-associated ECG abnormalities, NT-ProBNP levels suggestive of heart failure, and PCR positivity.
   Results
   Mortality after two years was 6.3%; it was lower in the TrG (2.8%) than the CG (7.6%); adjusted OR: 0.37 (95% CI: 0.21; 0.63). The ECG abnormalities typical for ChD and high age-adjusted NT-ProBNP levels suggestive of heart failure were lower in the TrG than the CG, OR: 0.35 [CI: 0.23; 0.53]. The TrG had significantly lower rates of PCR positivity, OR: 0.35 [CI: 0.27; 0.45].
   Conclusion
   Patients previously treated with benznidazole had significantly reduced parasitemia, a lower prevalence of markers of severe cardiomyopathy, and lower mortality after two years of follow-up. If used in the early phases, benznidazole treatment may improve clinical and parasitological outcomes in patients with chronic ChD.

AB  - Microtomography using synchrotron sources is a useful tool in biological imaging research since the phase coherence of synchrotron beams can be exploited to obtain images with high contrast resolution. This work is part of a series of works using phase contrast synchrotron microtomography in the study of Rhodnius prolixus head, the insect vector of Chagas' disease, responsible for about 12,000 deaths per year. The control of insect vector is the most efficient method to prevent this disease and studies have shown that the use of triflumuron, a chitin synthesis inhibitor, disrupted chitin synthesis during larval development and it's an alternative method against insect pests.
   The aim of this work was to investigate the biological effects of treatments with triflumuron in the ecdysis period (the moulting of the R. prolixus cuticle) using the new imaging beamline IMX at LNLS (Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory). Nymphs of R. prolixus were taken from the Laboratory of Biochemistry and Physiology of Insects, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Brazil. Doses of 0.05 mg of triflumuron were applied directly to the abdomen on half of the insects immediately after feeding. The insects were sacrificed 25 days after feeding (intermoulting period) and fixed with glutaraldehyde.
   The results obtained using phase contrast synchrotron microtomography in R. prolixus showed amazing images of the effects of triflumuron on insects in the ecdysis period, and the formation of the new cuticle on those which were not treated with triflumuron. Both formation and malformation of this insect's cuticle have never been seen before with this technique. (C) 2016 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective:HIV genotype-resistance testing can help identify more effective antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimens for patients, substantially increasing the likelihood of viral suppression and immune recovery. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of genotype-resistance testing before first-line ART initiation in Brazil.Design:We used a previously published microsimulation model of HIV disease (CEPAC-International) and data from Brazil to compare the clinical impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of initial genotype testing (Genotype) with no initial genotype testing (No genotype).Methods:Model parameters were derived from the HIV Clinical Cohort at the Evandro Chagas Clinical Research Institute and from published data, using Brazilian sources whenever possible. Baseline patient characteristics included 69% male, mean age of 36 years (SD, 10 years), mean CD4 count of 347 per microliter (SD, 300/mu L) at ART initiation, annual ART costs from 2012 US $1400 to US $13,400, genotype test cost of US $230, and primary resistance prevalence of 4.4%. Life expectancy and costs were discounted 3% per year. Genotype was defined as cost-effective compared with No Genotype if its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was less than 3 times the 2012 Brazilian per capita GDP of US $12,300.Results:Compared with No genotype, Genotype increased life expectancy from 18.45 to 18.47 years and reduced lifetime cost from US $45,000 to $44,770; thus, in the base case, Genotype was cost saving. Genotype was cost-effective at primary resistance prevalence as low as 1.4% and remained cost-effective when subsequent-line ART costs decreased to 30% of baseline value. Cost-inefficient results were observed only when simultaneously holding multiple parameters to extremes of their plausible ranges.Conclusions:Genotype-resistance testing in ART-naive individuals in Brazil will improve survival and decrease costs and should be incorporated into HIV treatment guidelines in Brazil.

AB  - Background: Wild, synanthropic and domestic mammals act as hosts and/or reservoirs of several Leishmania spp. Studies on possible reservoirs of Leishmania in different areas are fundamental to understand host-parasite interactions and develop strategies for the surveillance and control of leishmaniasis. In the present study, we evaluated the Leishmania spp. occurrence in mammals in two conservation units and their surroundings in Brasilia, Federal District (FD), Brazil.
   Methods: Small mammals were captured in Brasilia National Park (BNP) and Contagem Biological Reserve (CBR) and dogs were sampled in residential areas in their vicinity. Skin and blood samples were evaluated by PCR using different molecular markers (D7 24Sa rRNA and rDNA ITS1). Leishmania species were identified by sequencing of PCR products. Dog blood samples were subjected to the rapid immunochromatographic test (DPP) for detection of anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies.
   Results: 179 wild mammals were studied and 20.1% had Leishmania DNA successfully detected in at least one sample. Six mammal species were considered infected: Clyomys laticeps, Necromys lasiurus, Nectomys rattus, Rhipidomys macrurus, Didelphis albiventris and Gracilinanus agilis. No significant difference, comparing the proportion of individuals with Leishmania spp., was observed between the sampled areas and wild mammal species. Most of the positive samples were collected from the rodent N. lasiurus, infected by L. amazonensis or L. braziliensis. Moreover, infections by Trypanosoma spp. were detected in N. lasiurus and G. agilis. All 19 dog samples were positive by DPP; however, only three (15.8%) were confirmed by PCR assays. DNA sequences of ITS1 dog amplicons showed 100% identity with L. infantum sequence.
   Conclusions: The results suggest the participation of six species of wild mammals in the enzootic transmission of Leishmania spp. in FD. This is the first report of L. amazonensis in N. lasiurus.

AB  - Background: Cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis are parasitic diseases characterized by skin manifestations. In Brazil, Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis is one of the etiological agents of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The therapeutic arsenal routinely employed to treat infected patients is unsatisfactory, especially for pentavalent antimonials, as they are often highly toxic, poorly tolerated and of variable effectiveness. This study aimed to evaluate in vitro the leishmanicidal activity of toxins isolated from Crotalus durissus terrificus venom as a new approach for the treatment of leishmaniasis.
   Methods: The comparative effects of crotamine, crotoxin, gyrotoxin, convulxin and PLA2 on bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with L. (L.) amazonensis as well as the release of TGF-beta from the treated macrophages were studied.
   Results and Discussion: Crotamine had the strongest inhibitory effect on parasite growth rate (IC50: 25.65 +/- 0.52 mu g/mL), while convulxcin showed the weakest inhibitory effect (IC50: 52.7 +/- 2.21 mu g/mL). In addition, TGF-beta was significantly reduced after the treatment with all toxins evaluated.
   Conclusion: The Crotalus durissus terrificus toxins used in this study displayed significant activity against L. (L.) amazonensis, indicating that all of them could be a potential alternative for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.

AB  - As a part of our continuing search for insect and arthropod development regulators from Brazilian restinga vegetation of the Rio de Janeiro State, crude extracts, purified fractions and essential oils were submitted to screening tests seeking for biological activities on the development of the insects Rhodnius prolixus, Dysdercus peruvianus, Oncopeltus fasciatus and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus. Up to now, 102 secondary metabolites have been detected in the fractions, among them monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and two triterpenes which were obtained from the species, Eugenia sulcata, Pilocarpus spicatus, Manilkara subsericea, Alyrciariafloribunda and Zanthoxylum caribaeum. These secondary plant metabolites are considered of interest for the use of studies related to arthropod endocrinology, vectorparasite interaction system, and population control of vector insect and agricultural pest. The observed biological activities were surprisingly high, involving increased mortality, molting and metamorphosis inhibition, paralysis, corporeal deformities, apparition of permanent nymphs, of adultoids and juvenoids, partial or total inhibition of oviposition and egg hatching. These compounds are now being studied further to determine if they may or may not be useful in controlling insect populations and/or interfere with the life cycle and vector transmission of parasites to animal and human populations.

AB  - Background
   Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected chronic parasitic infection and a public health problem that is preventable, and has serious complications. In this study, the effects of age, period and birth cohort (APC Effects) on the evolution of the mortality of that disease in Brazil, from 1980-2014, according to sex and geographic region of the country, were analyzed. Mortality forecasts from the years 2015 to 2034 were estimated.
   Methods
   This is an ecological cross-sectional study in which death records and population data were extracted from the DATASUS (Department of Information Technology of the National Health System) website, in age groups from 20-24 years of age to 80 years and over, from 1980 to 2014. The rates were standardized according to age and sex distributions using the direct method. The APC models were estimated using the Bayesian approach, and the INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations) method was used for parameter inference. Super dispersion of the data was considered, and we included unstructured random terms in the models.
   Results
   During the analyzed period, there were 178,823 deaths in Brazil (3.85 annual deaths per 100,000 inhabitants). It was found that temporal effects on CD mortality varied by sex and region. In general, there was an increase in mortality rates up to 30 years of age, and the mortality rates were higher between 50 and 64 years of age. On average, men died five years younger than women. Mortality rates were highest in the Central West and Southeast regions. The Central West, Southeast and Southern regions had a reduction over time in the rate of CD deaths between 2000 and 2014. The mortality rate in the Northeast was not statistically different in any period analyzed, while the North had tendency to increase; however, a significant risk increase was only observed between 1995 and 1999. The rate of mortality was high in older birth cohorts. The overall prediction for the next two decades showed a progressive decline in CD mortality, which will be highest among the young. The expected average reduction was 76.1% compared to the last observed period (2010-2014) and the last predicted (2030-2034) period. The average reduction ranged from 86% in the 20-24 age group to 50% in the 80 and over age group.
   Conclusions
   In the present study, a higher death rate was observed for ages above 30 years, especially 50 to 64 years, and in the older birth cohorts. We believe these results can be related to period effects of vector control actions and preventive and care measures by the health system of Brazil, in addition to demographic changes in the period. The differences among the regions reflect socioeconomic inequities and access to the healthcare systems in the Brazilian population.

AB  - Rhodnius prolixus is the main triatomine insect vector of Chagas Disease, which affects between 6 and 8 million individuals, with approximately 12,000 deaths per year in Latin America. Azadirachtin is a drug that causes changes in several species of insects, including triatomines, thereby inhibiting their development.
   This work exploits Low-Energy X-Ray Microfluorescence (LEXRF) to evaluate the distribution of oxygen and sodium in the structures of the insect Rhodnius prolixus, and to understand the effects of azadirachtin treatment. Specimens of fifth-instar nymphs of Rhodnius prolixus were taken from the colony of the Laboratory of Biochemistry and Physiology of Insects (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Brazil) and were divided in two groups. In the first group, the insects were fed with defibrinated rabbit blood containing azadirachtin and the other group only with simply defibrinated rabbit blood. Both groups were examined at the TwinMic soft X-ray microscopy synchrotron beamline, (Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste, Trieste, Italy), providing elemental map distribution of oxygen which was correlated to the high-resolution morphological information obtained by the simultaneous absorption and differential phase contrast images.
   Prior to Low-Energy X-Ray Microfluorescence (LEXRF) measurements two control samples were scanned at the SYRMEP beamline (Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste, Trieste, Italy) by microtomography for an overview of the structures that were subsequently studied at TwinMic. The results allowed us to compare the differences in structures of the head of Rhodnius prolixus providing new insights into the insect's development that may be of significance toward the control of the Chagas Disease.

AB  - Aim: Previous studies showed that granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) improved heart function in a mice model of Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy (CCC). Herein, we report the interim results of the safety and efficacy of G-CSF therapy vs. placebo in adults with Chagas cardiomyopathy. Methods: Patients with CCC, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to IV and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 50% or below were included. A randomization list using blocks of 2 and 4 and an allocation rate of 1:1 was generated by R software which was stratified by functional class. Double blinding was done to both arms and assessors were masked to allocations. All patients received standard heart failure treatment for 2 months before 1:1 randomization to either the G-CSF (10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneously) or placebo group (1 mL of 0.9% saline subcutaneously). The primary endpoint was either maintenance or improvement of NYHA class from baseline to 6-12 months after treatment, and intention-to-treat analysis was used. Results: We screened 535 patients with CCC in Salvador, Brazil, of whom 37 were randomized. Overall, baseline characteristics were well-balanced between groups. Most patients had NYHA class II heart failure (86.4%); low mean LVEF was 32 & PLUSMN; 7% in the G-CSF group and 33 & PLUSMN; 10% in the placebo group. Frequency of primary endpoint was 78% (95% CI 0.60-0.97) vs. 66% (95% CI 0.40-0.86), p = 0.47, at 6 months and 68% (95% CI 0.43-0.87) vs. 72% (95% CI 0.46-0.90), p = 0.80, at 12 months in placebo and G-CSF groups, respectively. G-CSF treatment was safe, without any related serious adverse events. There was no difference in mortality between both arms, with five deaths (18.5%) in treatment vs. four (12.5%) in the placebo arm. Exploratory analysis demonstrated that the maximum rate of oxygen consumption during exercise (VO2 max) showed an improving trend in the G-CSF group. Conclusion: G-CSF therapy was safe and well-tolerated in 12 months of follow-up. Although prevention of symptom progression could not be demonstrated in the present study, our results support further investigation of G-CSF therapy in Chagas cardiomyopathy patients.

AB  - Triatomines are insects that are taxonomically included in the Hemiptera order and Triatominae subfamily. Based on phenotypic similarity, capacity hybridization, and genetic and ecological aspects, the triatomine species can be grouped into specific complexes and subcomplexes. However, these groupings have not been confirmed. Cytogenetic analyses are important cytotaxonomic tools for improving the taxonomic knowledge of triatomines. Thus, we examined the karyotype of Triatoma baratai and compared the results with those of other species in the Matogrossensis subcomplex in order increase the understanding of vector potential. We also examined the cytotaxonomic classification of this insect. Triatoma baratai, similarly to other species that currently compose the Matogrossensis subcomplex, contains 22 chromosomes (20A + XY). Here, we describe the diploid chromosome set of Triatoma baratai. We confirmed their current classification in the Matogrossensis subcomplex and demonstrated that the species in this subcomplex present karyotype homogeneity.

AB  - There is a lot of bacterial, viral or parasite infections who are able to be transmitted vertically from the mother to the fetus or newborn which implicates an enormous risk for it. The TORCH acronym is used universally to refer to a fetus or newborn which presents clinical features compatible with a vertically acquired infection and allows a rational diagnostic and therapeutic approach. The traditional "TORCH test" is nowadays considered not appropriate and it has been replaced for specific test for specific pathogens under well defined circumstances. The present document reviews the general characteristics, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic and therapeutic options for the most frequently involved pathogens in the fetus or newborn with TORCH suspicion.

AB  - In spite of long-term efforts to eliminate Triatoma infestans (Klug 1834) from Brazil, residual foci still persist in the states of Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul. Data on the genetic variability and structuring of these populations are however lacking. Using nine microsatellite loci, we characterized one residual T. infestans population from Bahia and four from Rio Grande do Sul, and compared them with bugs originally from an older focus in So Paulo; 224 bugs were genotyped. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 5 to 11. Observed and expected heterozygosities per locus ranged, respectively, from 0 to 0.786 and from 0 to 0.764. Significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, mainly due to heterozygote deficits, were detected in all loci and in most populations. Global indices estimated by AMOVA were: Fis was 0.37; Fst was 0.28; and Fit was 0.55; overall indices with p = 0.00 indicated substantial differentiation. Inter-population Fst ranged from 0.118 to 0.562, suggesting strong genetic structuring and little to no gene flow among populations. Intra-population Fis ranged from 0.301 to 0.307. Inbreeding was apparent in all populations except that from Bahia-which might be either linked by gene flow to nearby unsampled populations or part of a relatively large local population. The overall pattern of strong genetic structuring among pyrethroid-susceptible residual T. infestans populations suggests that their persistence is probably due to operational control failures. Detection and elimination of such residual foci is technically feasible and must become a public health priority in Brazil.

AB  - Introduction Monitoring the HIV epidemic and identifying populations among whom HIV is spreading is critical. We aimed to provide an estimate of the annualized HIV incidence rate using recency testing among cisgender men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) at a reference centre in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Methods We evaluated MSM and TGW who sought HIV testing at the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases-FIOCRUZ between March 2018 and January 2020. The Limiting Avidity assay (LAg) as part of a recent infection testing algorithm (RITA) was employed to identify recent infections (those with a normalized optical density <= 1.5 in the LAg that met all RITA criteria) among those who tested positive for HIV and the annualized HIV incidence was estimated. Results and discussion Out of 3053 individuals assessed, 2591 (84.9%) were HIV negative and 462 (15.1%) were living with HIV. Among these, 302 (65.4%) with stored samples available were evaluated and 73/302 (24.2%) were classified as recent infections. The annualized incidence rate estimate using a false recency rate of zero was 7.35% (95% CI 5.76% to 9.25%). Conclusions Our results suggest that the HIV epidemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, continues to disproportionately burden vulnerable populations, including MSM and TGW despite the existence and availability of effective preventive and therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Infectious diseases are still significant causes of deaths in Brazil. The objective of this study was to estimate the burden of selected infectious diseases in the Brazilian Southern state of Santa Catarina in 2011. An ecological study was conducted. The infectious diseases included were HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Chagas disease, diarrheal diseases and other infectious diseases. Data were collected from official health information systems. Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) were estimated by the sum of Years of Life Lost (YLL) and Years Lived with Disability (YLD). 45,237.33 DALYs were estimated, with a rate of 685.46 DALYs per 100,000 population. 92.9% was due to YLL and 7.1% to YLD. Men and the age range of 0-4 years presented higher burden. The highest burden was attributed to HIV/AIDS. There was a high concentration of burden rates in the coast regions of the state. It could be concluded that more than 90% of the burden was attributed to the early mortality component. The highest burden was observed among men, children under 5 years of age and at the coast regions of the state. The highest levels of burden were due to HIV/AIDS.

AB  - The Recommendations for Management of Endemic Diseases and Travel Medicine in Solid-Organ Transplant Recipients and Donors: Latin America clinical practice guideline is intended to guide clinicians caring for solid-organ transplant (SOT) donors, candidates and recipients regarding infectious diseases (ID) issues related to this geographical region, mostly located in the tropics. These recommendations are based on both systematic reviews of relevant literature and expert opinion from both transplant ID and travel medicine specialists. The guidelines provide recommendations for risk evaluation and laboratory investigation, as well as management and prevention of infection of the most relevant endemic diseases of Latin America. This summary includes a brief description of the guideline recommendations but does not include the complete rationale and references for each recommendation, which is available in the online version of the article, published in this journal as a supplement.

AB  - Background Chagas cardiomyopathy (ChC) prevalence is decreasing in Brazil and medical therapies for heart failure (HF) have improved in the last decade. Whether these changes modified the prognosis of ChC relative to non-Chagas cardiomyopathies (NChC) remains unknown. This study evaluated the temporal trends in population attributable risk (PAR) of ChC for 2-year mortality among patients with HF enrolled at years 2002-2004 (era 1) and 2012-2014 (era 2) in a Brazilian university hospital.
   Methods We prospectively studied 362 (15% with ChC) and 582 (18% with ChC) HF patients with ejection fraction <= 50% in eras 1 and 2, respectively and estimated the PAR of ChC for 2-year mortality.
   Results There were 145 deaths (29 in ChC) in era 1 and 85 deaths (26 in ChC) in era 2. In multivariable Cox-regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, ejection fraction, heart rate, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure and ischaemic/valvar aetiology, ChC was associated with higher risk of death in era 1 (HR (95% CI)=1.92 (1.00 to 3.71), p=0.05) and era 2 (HR (95% CI)=3.51 (1.94 to 6.36), p<0.001). In fully adjusted analysis, the PAR of ChC for mortality increased twofold from era 1 (PAR (95% CI)=11.0 (2.8 to 18.5)%) to era 2 (PAR (95% CI)=21.9 (16.5 to 26.9)%; p=0.023 versus era 1).
   Conclusion Although the absolute death rates decreased over time in the ChC and NChC groups, the PAR of ChC for mortality increased among patients with HF, driven by increases in the HR associated with ChC. Our results highlight the need for additional efforts aiming to prevent and treat ChC.

AB  - This work describes the antiparasitic and cytotoxic activities of three plant species from the Cerrado biome, Northeastern Brazil. Significant antiparasitic inhibition was observed against Trypanosoma cruzi (63.86%), Leishmania brasiliensis (92.20%) and Leishmania infantum (95.23%) when using ethanol extract from leaves of Guazuma ulmifolia Lam. (Malvaceae), at a concentration of 500 mu g/mL. However, low levels of inhibition were observed when assessing leishmanicidal and trypanocidal (Clone CL-B5) activities of crude ethanol extracts from leaves and bast tissue of Luehea paniculata (Malvaceae) and leaves and bark of Prockia crucis (Salicaceae) at a concentration of 500 mu g/mL. The extracts revealed the presence of phenolic acids such as gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and rosmarinic acid, as well as flavonoids such as rutin, luteolin, apigenin and quercetin the latter detected only in G. ulmifolia. G. ulmifolia extract displayed higher leishmanicidal activity probably due to the presence of quercetin, a potent known leishmanicidal compound. A cytotoxicity test indicated values over 50% at the highest concentration (1000 mu g/mL) for all natural products, which were considered cytotoxic. This points out the need for further tests to enable future in vivo trials, including antineoplastic activity on human tumor cells. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Serodiagnosis of Leishmania infantum infection in dogs relies on the detection of antibodies against leishmanial crude extracts or parasitic defined antigens. The expansion of canine leishmaniasis from geographical areas of Brazil in which the infection is endemic to regions in which the disease is emerging is occurring. This fact makes necessary the analysis of the serodiagnostic capabilities of different leishmanial preparations in distinct geographical locations. In this article sera from dogs infected with Leishmania and showing the clinical form of the disease, were collected in three distinct Brazilian States and were tested against soluble leishmanial antigens or seven parasite individual antigens produced as recombinant proteins. We show that the recognition of soluble leishmanial antigens by sera from these animals was influenced by the geographical location of the infected dogs. Efficacy of the diagnosis based on this crude parasite preparation was higher in newly endemic regions when compared with areas of high disease endemicity. We also show that the use of three of the recombinant proteins, namely parasite surface kinetoplastid membrane protein of 11 kDa (KMP-11), and two members of the P protein family (P2a and PO), can improve the degree of sensitivity without adversely affecting the specificity of the diagnostic assays for canine leishmaniasis, independently of the geographical area of residence. In addition, sera from dogs clinically healthy but infected were also assayed with some of the antigen preparations. We demonstrate that the use of these proteins can help to the serodiagnosis of Leishmania infected animals with subclinical infections. Finally, we propose a diagnostic protocol using a combination of KMP-11, P2a y P0, together with total leishmanial extracts. (C) 2019 The Authors.

KW  - SCALE
AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease and its main consequence is chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC). The clinical manifestations of CD can cause functional limitation and impact on the perception of quality of life (QoL). We evaluated the QoL profile of patients with CD living in remote regions, and their association with socio-demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics.A cross-sectional study, using the baseline of a cohort study (SaMi-Trop) was conducted in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, an endemic region for CD. The cohort is composed of 1959 patients with CD. The patients were interviewed, and blood collection and electrocardiogram (ECG) were performed. The WHOQOL-BREF scale was used to assess QoL. Descriptive statistics were performed and, for the QoL scale, measures of central tendency and dispersion were calculated. Inflated beta regression models constructed using the gamlss framework were used, and fitted using R software. A significance level of 5% for all analyzes was adopted.QoL was evaluated in 625 participants. The Environment (57.66) and Social Relationships (73.17) domains presented the lowest and highest QoL score respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between QoL domains in the presence of CCC. In the multivariate analysis, the factors associated with a lower QoL were in the Physical domain age increase (OR: 0.95, CI: 0.91-0.99) and using an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (OR 0.89; CI: 0.80-0.99); in the Social Relations domain a history of acute myocardial infarction (OR: 0.75; CI: 0.61-0.92); and in the Environment domain age increase (OR 0.94, CI 0.91-0.97). The factor associated with higher QoL was the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (OR: 1.15; CI 1.04-1.26).The findings of this study reinforce the importance of QoL indicators for planning care and clinical management of patients from remote regions with CD.

AB  - Introduction: Development of technologies to reduce transfusion risks of infectious diseases is a major characteristic of hemotherapy. Thus, each donation undergoes clinical and serological screening tests to ensure the donated blood do not offer risks to the receiver. Objective: Evaluate the prevalence of positive serology in blood donations rejected by Hemobanco (Curitiba - PR) in the period ranging from January 2003 to December 2012.
   Methodology: During the period studied, we observed the total number of donations and its division according to gender. We also analyzed the number of rejected donations due to seropositivity, considering the diseases investigated routinely in blood banks in Brazil, and the frequency of discards according to age groups.
   Results: Within the period studied, 399,280 donations were performed. 62.0% donors were male. Comparing 2003 to 2012, we noticed a significant decrease of discards, from 10.2% to 5.0%, respectively. There was a reduction of seropositivity for HIV, HBsAg and anti-HBc and an increase for Chagas Disease, hepatitis C, syphilis and HTLV. The age group with the highest prevalence for discards changed: it used to be the 40-59 years old group in 2003, and became the 20-39 years old group in 2012.
   Conclusion: There was an increase in the number of donations in Hemobanco and a decrease in total discards due to seropositive donations. Most donors were male. The most prevalent cause of discards only amongst seropositive donation discards is seropositivity for anti-HBc. There was a significant increase of donors aged between 20 and 39 years old.

AB  - It aims to analyze the profile of Latin American production of Tropical Medicine on Web of Science (1945-2016), specifically the articles published in journals. The adopted methodological procedures were as follows: (1) data collection: they collected the data from the Web of Science from the query term "tropical medicine" in the "topic field"; (2) data processing using the Vantage Point; (3) issue identification: the subjects were obtained in the keywords of the articles. They prioritized keywords indicating names of diseases and their causative agents, given the possibility to find out what illnesses receive greater attention from researchers; (4) relationship analysis: the relationships between subjects, institutions producing scientific papers and journals were identified using the UCINET/NetDraw software. As main results, it was observed that: the most fruitful relationships between institutions and subjects are established by Brazilian institutions: Fiocruz (RJ) and leishmaniasis (13); Fiocruz (MG) and leishmaniasis (8); Federal University of Minas Gerais and leishmaniasis (8) and sao Paulo University and leishmaniasis (7). The diseases and causative agents with the highest appearance rate in the production analyzed were: leishmaniasis (60), Chagas disease (30), aids (23), malaria (21), dengue (19), diarrhea (13) and tuberculosis (12). Brazil (59%), Peru (9.6%), Venezuela (7.5%) and Cuba (6.9%) are the most representative Latin American countries in terms of production. The most intense cooperation relations between the countries are established between Brazil and the United States. The most representative journal was Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, responsible for more than two thirds of the indexed production.

AB  - Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of often chronic and disabling infectious conditions, closely related to poverty and inequities. While it is estimated that millions of people are affected, accurate and internationally comparable data about NTD-related morbidity and disability are lacking. Therefore we aimed to develop and pilot a toolkit to assess and monitor morbidity and disability across NTDs.
   A cross-sectional, non-random survey design with a mixed methods approach was used. We conducted a literature review on existing tools to assess and monitor disability, followed by a Delphi study with NTD experts to compile a prototype toolkit. A first-phase validation study was conducted in Northeast Brazil among people with Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, leprosy and schistosomiasis.
   Instruments included were the clinical profile, WHODAS, P-scale, SRQ, WHOQOL-BREF and WHOQOL-DIS. Most questions in the various instruments were readily understood with the exception of the WHOQOL-BREF, where additional explanations and examples were often needed. The respondents were very appreciative of the instruments and found it valuable to have the opportunity to talk about these aspects of their condition.
   Our findings support the acceptability and relevance of five of the six instruments tested and the concept of a cross-NTD toolkit.

AB  - Triatoma sordida is an endemic Chagas disease vector in South America, distributed in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Chromosomal, molecular, isoenzymatic, and cuticular hydrocarbon pattern studies indicate cryptic speciation in T. sordida. Recently, T. rosai was described from specimens from Argentina initially characterized as T. sordida. Although several authors assume that the speciation process that supports this differentiation in T. sordida is the result of cryptic speciation, further morphological and/or morphometric studies are necessary to prove the application of this evolutionary event, because the only morphological intraspecific comparison performed in T. sordida is based on geometric morphometry and the only interspecific comparison made is between T. rosai and T. sordida from Brazil that evaluated morphological and morphometric differences. Based on this, morphological analyses of thorax and abdomen using Scanning Electron Microscopy and morphometric analyses of the head, thorax, and abdomen among T. sordida from Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay, as well as T. rosai, were performed to assess whether the evolutionary process responsible for variations is the cryptic speciation phenomenon. Morphological differences in the thorax and female external genitalia, as well as morphometric differences in the head, thorax, abdomen, pronotum, and scutellum structures, were observed. Based on this, the evolutionary process that supports, so far, these divergences observed for T. sordida populations/T. sordida subcomplex is not cryptic speciation. Moreover, we draw attention to the necessity for morphological/morphometric studies to correctly apply the cryptic species/speciation terms in triatomines.

KW  - PROFILE
AB  - Background: Benznidazole is one of the two most effective antiparasitic drugs for Chagas' disease treatment. However, knowledge about its toxicity profile is mostly based on post-marketing observational studies.
   Objectives: Our study combines data from two prospective clinical trials designed to assess the safety of the drug newly produced by ELEA Laboratories (Abarax VR).
   Methods: Eligible participants were selected using a consecutive sampling strategy in the CINEBENZ and BIOMARCHA studies between 2013 and 2016 (EUDRACT 2011-002900-34 and 2012-002645-38, respectively, and clinicaltrials.gov NCT01755403 and NCT01755377, respectively). Enrolled subjects received treatment with 5 mg/kg/day benznidazole orally in two divided doses for 8 weeks and were followed up fortnightly.
   Results: We observed 305 adverse reactions in 85 of 99 participants (85.9%). Each patient had a median of three adverse reactions, 89.5% were mild and the median duration was 12 days. Most adverse reactions appeared in the first month of treatment except arthritis and peripheral neuropathy. Twenty-six patients did not complete treatment: 2 were withdrawn, 1 for ectopic pregnancy and 1 for epilepsy relapse due to cysticercosis; 2 were lost to follow-up; and 22 were owing to adverse reactions, two of them severe. We observed some unexpected adverse reactions that have not been described previously, such as psychiatric symptoms, erectile dysfunction, menstrual cycle alterations and lung infiltration.
   Conclusions: There is a very high frequency of adverse reactions to benznidazole. Most adverse reactions are mild, but the treatment burden is significant and unexpected reactions are not rare. Severe reactions are uncommon, but they can be life-threatening. Further studies are necessary to optimize treatment.

AB  - Background: Triatomasordida is one of the main Chagas disease vectors in Brazil. In addition to Brazil, this species has already been reported in Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. It is hypothesized that the insects currently identified as T. sordida are a species subcomplex formed by three cytotypes (T. sordida sensu stricto T. sordida La Paz, and T. sordida Argentina). With the recent description of T. rosai from the Argentinean specimens, it became necessary to assess the taxonomic status of T. sordida from La Paz, Bolivia, since it was suggested that it may represent a new species, which has taxonomic, evolutionary, and epidemiological implications. Based on the above, we carried out molecular and experimental crossover studies to assess the specific status of T. sordida La Paz.
   Methods: To evaluate the pre- and postzygotic barriers between T. sordida La Paz and T. sordida s.s., experimental crosses and intercrosses between F1 hybrids and between F2 hybrids were conducted. In addition, cytogenetic analyses of the F1 and F2 hybrids were applied with an emphasis on the degree of pairing between the homeologous chromosomes, and morphological analyses of the male gonads were performed to evaluate the presence of gonadal dysgenesis. Lastly, the genetic distance between T sordida La Paz and T sordida s.s. was calculated for the CYTB, ND1, and 1TS1 genes.
   Results: Regardless of the gene used, T. sordida La Paz showed low genetic distance compared to T sordida s.s. (below 2%). Experimental crosses resulted in off spring for both directions, demonstrating that there are no prezygotic barriers installed between these allopatric populations. Furthermore, postzygotic barriers were not observed either (since the F1 x F1 and F2 x F2 intercrosses resulted in viable offspring). Morphological and cytogenetic analyses of the male gonads of the F1 and F2 offspring demonstrated that the testes were not atrophied and did not show chromosome pairing errors.
   Conclusion: Based on the low genetic distance (which configures intraspecific variation), associated with the absence of prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive barriers, we confirm that T. sordida La Paz represents only a chromosomal polymorphism of T. sordida s.

AB  - Background
   Field ecologists often rely on mark-release-recapture (MRR) experiments to estimate population dynamics parameters for a given species. In the case of a medically important taxon, i.e., a disease vector, inferences on species survival and dispersal rates are particularly important as they have the potential to provide insights into disease transmission dynamics in endemic areas. Medical entomologists have traditionally used fluorescent dusts to externally mark the cuticle of insects. However, dust marking is usually restricted to the adult life stage because immature insects lose the mark when they molt.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   We evaluated the efficacy of 13 trace elements in marking nymphs of three native Brazilian Chagas disease vectors: Triatoma brasiliensis, Triatoma pseudomaculata, and Rhodnius nasutus. Cr and Cu were detected in over 97% of T. brasiliensis (34/35 31/31 for Cr and Cu), while Cu and Mn were detected in more than 95% of T. pseudomaculata (29/29 for Cu and 28/29 for Mn) tested 120 days after marking. Only Mn marked over 90% of R. nasutus nymphs (38/41). Overall, trace elements had no negative effects on T. pseudomaculata longevity, but As-marked T. brasiliensis nymphs (p<0.01), and Cd-marked R. nasutus nymphs (p<0.01) had significantly shorter lifespan.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Previous evidence shows that there is little or no genetic differentiation between populations at the microgeographic level, which often precludes indirect estimations of dispersal capability based on genetic markers. In such situations, MRR studies are more suitable as they measure insect movement directly from one site to another, instead of effective migration (i.e. gene flow). The determination of a reliable and persistent marking method is the first step towards the development of meaningful ecological estimates through the application of MRR methodology. Here, we have identified trace elements that can be used for mark and recapture studies of three triatomine species in Brazil.

AB  - Methods aiming detection and inference of spatial clusters are of great relevance. Both for its applicability to public health problems, as well as for the effective scientific interest in the development of these methods. The main techniques are based on spatial scan statistics and many applications link this statistic in efficient optimization methods. Recently, regularity functions have been proposed to control the excessive freedom of the shape of spatial clusters whenever the spatial scan statistic is used. We present a novel scan statistic algorithm employing a function based on the geographical dispersion to penalize the presence of a huge gap between the areas in candidate clusters, the dispersion function. The proposed multi-objective scan maximize the spatial scan and minimize the dispersion function, using particle swarm optimization. We show that, compared to the non-connectivity regularity function, the multi-objective scan with dispersion function is faster and suited for the detection of moderately irregularly shaped clusters. An application is presented using comprehensive state-wide data for Chagas' disease in puerperal women in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. We show that, the multi-objective approach with the dispersion function is a promising algorithm for the detection of irregularly shaped clusters.

AB  - In Brazil, the main strategy adopted to contain Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is the controversial culling of dogs with reagent serology for Canine VL (CVL). Despite there are studies showing that significant reduction of human cases has not been observed, as well as there are works demonstrating the occurrence of false-positive results in the confirmatory test, the protocol has been maintained. Researches that can reinforce the existence and persistence of this problem, as well as bring concrete alternatives are pivotal. In this context, the aim of this work was to evaluate and compare the serological, molecular and parasitological methods employed for CVL detection in Brazil, in dogs with diverse clinical profiles, from two endemic areas of Pernambuco state. Comparisons among TR-DPP., EIE-LVC and qPCR (animals from Goiana-PE: 91) demonstrated that agreements varied from 'poor' to 'moderate' (kappa = 0.162-0.442), and a triple agreement occurred in 61.36% (54/88) of the samples. The highest percentage of agreement was obtained between TR-DPP. and EIE-LVC within the polysymptomatic group (93.33%; 14/15). Of the 34 dogs with reagent serology from Caruaru-PE, 17 (50%) and 29 dogs (85.29%) were positive for qPCR and parasitological exam, respectively. By comparing serology, qPCR and parasitological exam, the lowest percentage of agreements were obtained within the asymptomatic group (40%-72.72%). It was possible to observe that the percentage of agreement tended to decrease according to the absence of clinical manifestations in the dogs. Thus, from the fact that all diagnostic tools evaluated have their limitations, it is very important to be careful before to propose an alternative set of diagnostic criteria. Besides, the answer for better results in the control of CVL may not be in the choose of the best set of diagnostic tools, but it may be in the strategy of culling itself. In this context, it is very important to invest in alternative control measures, such as mass vaccination and treatment of dogs, thus reducing the transmission to the vector and helping to avoid new canine and human cases.

AB  - The black-handed spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) is a platyrrhine primate distributed in southern Mexico, Central America, and part of South America. Two subspecies inhabit Mexico: Ateles geoffroyi vellerosus and Ateles geoffroyi yucatanensis, both threatened with extinction. Serological evidence of exposure of spider monkeys to various groups of parasites such as Trypanosoma cruzi in Mexico and Leishmania spp. in Brazil has been reported. The genus Leishmania encompasses about 23 species of flagellate protozoa that are transmitted by the bite of females of Phlebotominae sand flies. These parasites cause a zoonotic disease called leishmaniasis, which generates skin, mucocutaneous and/or visceral manifestations. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the presence of Leishmania sp. in spider monkeys from the Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, Veracruz, Mexico. Blood samples from 10 free- ranging specimens of A. geoffroyi yucatanensis and 11 specimens in captivity of A. geoffroyi vellerosus were collected and used. The samples were subjected to a conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction test for the identification of a 116 bp fragment of a region from the kinetoplast minicircle of the parasite. Our analyzes showed that 71.4% of the sampled animals had fragment sizes compatible with Leishmania spp. The implications involve the survival of the specimens and the possibility that these primates act as sentinels of the disease. Furthermore, it is the first report suggesting the presence of Leishmania spp. in A. geoffroyi vellerosus and A. geoffroyi yucatanensis in Veracruz, Mexico.

AB  - Sporotrichosis is a neglected fungal infection caused by Sporothrix spp., which have a worldwide distribution. The standard antifungal itraconazole has been recommended as a first-line therapy. However, failure cases in human and feline treatment have been reported in recent years. This study aimed to synthesize several alpha- and beta-2,3-dihydrofuranaphthoquinones and evaluate them against Sporothrix schenckii and Sporothrix brasiliensis-the main etiological agents of sporotrichosis in Brazil. The stability of these compounds was also investigated under different storage conditions for 3 months. The samples were removed at 0, 60, and 90 days and assessed by H-1-NMR, and their in vitro antifungal susceptibility was tested. Furthermore, we evaluated the superficial changes caused by the most effective and stable compounds using scanning electron microscopy and determined their effects when combined with itraconazole. Nine dihydrofuranaphthoquinones showed good antifungal activity and stability, with MIC values of 2-32 mu M. Compounds 6 and 10 were the most active dihydrofuranaphthoquinones in vitro for both species; in fungi, these compounds induced yeast-hyphae conversion and alteration in the hyphae and conidia structures. Compound 10 also exhibited a synergistic activity with itraconazole against S. schenckii, with a Sigma FIC index value of 0.3. Our results indicate that Compounds 6 and 10 are potential candidates for the development of new antifungal agents for the treatment of sporotrichosis.

AB  - Leishmania spp. are parasitic protozoa that cause leishmaniasis, a disease endemic in 98 countries. Leishmania promastigotes are transmitted by the vector and differentiate into amastigotes within phagocytic cells of the vertebrate host. To survive in multiple and hostile environments, the parasite has several virulence factors. Oligopeptidase B (OPB) is a serine peptidase present in prokaryotes, some eukaryotes and some higher plants. It has been considered a virulence factor in trypanosomatids, but only a few studies, performed with Old World species, analysed its role in Leishmania virulence or infectivity.
   L. (L.) amazonensis is an important agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Brazil. The L. (L.) amazonensis OPB encoding gene has been sequenced and analysed in silico but has never been expressed. In this work, we produced recombinant L. (L.) amazonensis OPB and showed that its pH preferences, Km and inhibition patterns are similar to those reported for L. (L.) major and L. (L.) donovani OPBs. Since Leishmania is known to secrete OPB, we performed in vitro infection assays using the recombinant enzyme. Our results showed that active OPB increased in vitro infection by L. (L.) amazonensis when present before and throughout infection. Our findings suggest that OPB is relevant to L. (L.) amazonensis infection, and that potential drugs acting through OPB will probably be effective for Old and New World Leishmania species. OPB inhibitors may eventually be explored for leishmaniasis chemotherapy.

AB  - The relationship among bats, ectoparasites and associated microorganisms is important to investigate how humans can become exposed to zoonotic agents. Even though the diversity of Bartonella spp. in bats and ectoparasites has been previously reported, the occurrence of gltA genotypes within hosts has not been assessed so far. We aimed to investigate the genetic diversity of Bartonella spp. in non-hematophagous bats and associated ectoparasites by assessing cloned gltA Bartonella genotypes in intra- and inter-hosts levels, as well as by using three additional molecular markers. Overall, 13.5% (18/133) bat blood samples, 17.18% bat flies (11/64) and 23.8% (5/21) Macronyssidae mite pools showed to be positive for Bartonella spp. Seventeen positive samples were submitted to gltA-cloning and three clones were sequenced for each sample. We also obtained 11, seven and three sequences for nuoG, rpoB and ftsZ genes, respectively. None were positive for the other target genes. We found at least two genotypes among the three gltA-cloned sequences from each sample, and 13 between all the 51 sequences. Among the nuoG, rpoB and ftsZ sequences we found eight, five and three genotypes, respectively. In the phylogenetic analysis, the sequences were positioned mainly in groups related to Bartonella identified in rodents, bats and bat flies. Herein, we showed the genetic diversity of Bartonella in bat's blood and associated ectoparasites samples at both intra- and inter-host levels.

AB  - Objective. Determine the mortality from neglected tropical diseases (NTD) in Argentina from 1991 to 2016, their overall temporal trend and the trend for the most frequent causes by age and sex.
   Methods. Argentina's crude age-specific and age-adjusted mortality from NTDs were calculated for the period 1991-2016. The temporal trend was analyzed using joinpoint regression models.
   Results. Mortality from NTDs is a phenomenon observed primarily in people over 50 and men. The trend in the age-adjusted NTD death rates shows a statistically significant decline between 1991 and 2016, with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) for both sexes of -3.98 (CI 95%: -4.69; -3.25). In terms of the selected diseases, a steady decline in the rates for echinococcus is observed in the period 1991-2016, while two periods can be identified for Chagas, one in which the decline is significant (1991-2008) and another in which it is not (2008-2016). With regard to leprosy, a period with a sharp and significant increase is observed (1991-1998), followed by another period (1998-2016) of significant moderate decline. With the exception of echinococcus, the selected diseases are found basically in northwestern and northeastern Argentina.
   Conclusions. The downward trend in mortality from NTDs is significant for both sexes. It is clear that despite the decline in recent years, mortality from NTDs is an important public health problem.

AB  - Didelphis albiventris are found throughout Northeast and Central Brazil to central-southern Uruguay and it was subject of few studies in a population level. Given this, the present study investigated the genetic variability of the species using the mitochondrial molecular marker cytochrome oxidase c subunit I. We analyzed samples from the different biomes within three Brazilian regions: Northeast (Caatinga, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest), Southeast (Cerrado, Atlantic Forest, Cerrado/Atlantic Forest, and Cerrado/Caatinga ecotones) and South (Pampa and Atlantic Forest). Software BAPs retrieved five distinct demes: dm 1, dm 2, and dm 5 that occurs in South, Northeast and Southeast regions respectively and the dm 3 and dm 4 are wide distributed in Northeast and Southeast. Population analysis performed with AMOVA, haplotype network and Mantel test estimated the veracity of the demes. The F-ST shows structuring for the five demes, with dm 1 (South region) isolated from the others, however the other analysis showed the Northeast/Southeast demes (dm 2-5) united, diagnosing gene flow between them, mainly at the transitional zones, in areas as far away as areas with similar latitude interval (Southeast vs South) that was not detected gene flow. In the haplotype network, the mutational steps was conclusive in split dm 1 from dm 2-5 with 15 mutational steps and the Mantel test was moderated, which is explained by genetic similarity despite the great geographic distances (Northeast/Southeast). Thus, our analysis recognized two different lineages (South and Northeast/Southeast) and indicate that the biomes were not decisive in their isolation. The sharing of demes at the transitional zones and in areas with high latitudinal intervals reflects a recent ancestral polymorphism for D. albiventris. The plasticity in the occupation of the space by this species contributes in its wide dispersion capability, that is, geographical distribution. Our results revealed important implications for the management of D. albiventris in these transitional zones areas where demes were shared.

AB  - Objectives The objectives of this study were to describe a novel statewide registry for cardiac surgery in Brazil (REPLICCAR), to compare a regional risk model (SPScore) with EuroSCORE II and STS, and to understand where quality improvement and safety initiatives can be implemented. Methods A total of 11 sites in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, formed an online registry platform to capture information on risk factors and outcomes after cardiac surgery procedures for all consecutive patients. EuroSCORE II and STS values were calculated for each patient. An SPScore model was designed and compared with EuroSCORE II and STS to predict 30-day outcomes: death, reoperation, readmission, and any morbidity. Results A total of 5222 patients were enrolled in this study between November 2013 and December 2017. The observed 30-day mortality rate was 7.6%. Most patients were older, overweight, and classified as New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III; 14.5% of the patient population had a positive diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease, 10.9% had insulin-dependent diabetes, and 19 individuals had a positive diagnosis of Chagas disease. When evaluating the prediction performance, we found that SPScore outperformed EuroSCORE II and STS in the prediction of mortality (0.90 vs. 0.76 and 0.77), reoperation (0.84 vs. 0.60 and 0.56), readmission (0.84 vs. 0.55 and 0.51), and any morbidity (0.80 vs. 0.65 and 0.64), respectively (p<0.001). Conclusions The REPLICCAR registry might stimulate the creation of other cardiac surgery registries in developing countries, ultimately improving the regional quality of care provided to patients.

AB  - Background: Tuberculosis is the most frequent opportunistic infection and the leading cause of death among persons living with HIV in several low and middle-income countries. Mortality rates during tuberculosis treatment and death causes among HIV-1/TB co-infected patients may differ based on the immunosuppression severity, timing of diagnosis and prompt initiation of tuberculosis and antiretroviral therapy.
   Methods: This was a retrospective observational study conducted in the clinical cohort of patients with HIV-1/Aids of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Evandro Chagas, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. All HIV-1 infected patients who started combination antiretroviral therapy up to 30 days before or within 180 days after the start of tuberculosis treatment from 2000 to 2010 were eligible. Causes of death were categorized according to the "Coding Causes of Death in HIV" (CoDe) protocol. The Cox model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of selected mortality variables.
   Results: A total of 310 patients were included. Sixty-four patients died during the study period. Mortality rate following tuberculosis treatment initiation was 44 per 100 person-years within the first 30 days, 28.1 per 100 person-years within 31 and 90 days, 6 per 100 person-years within 91 and 365 days and 1.6 per 100 person-years after 365 days. Death probability within one year from tuberculosis treatment initiation was approximately 13%. In the adjusted analysis the associated factors with mortality were: CD4 <= 50 cells/mm(3) (HR: 3.10; 95% CI: 1.720 to 5.580; p = 0.00); mechanical ventilation (HR: 2.81; 95% CI: 1.170 to 6.760; p = 0.02); and disseminated tuberculosis (HR: 3.70; 95% CI: 1.290 to 10.590, p = 0.01). Invasive bacterial disease was the main immediate cause of death (46.9%).
   Conclusion: Our results evidence the high morbidity and mortality among patients co-infected with HIV-1 and tuberculosis in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. During the first year following tuberculosis diagnosis, mortality was the highest within the first 3 months, being invasive bacterial infection the major cause of death. In order to successfully intervene in this scenario, it is utterly necessary to address the social determinants of health contributing to the inequitable health care access faced by this population.

KW  - Health promotion, Vulnerable population, River dwellers
AB  - In Brazilian territory, we not only find inhabitants in urban and rural spaces, there is also a group that lives on the river banks known as ribeirinhos, most of them in the Amazon state. The riverside people are a group of people who live in floating houses and/or on the banks of rivers, they are low-income communities, live off what nature provides, from their own crafts and plantations, they experience many difficulties and dangers. It is a population vulnerable to various types of diseases and has little access to health care, which causes them to seek healing for their problems directly from nature and their mystical beliefs. This is all related to the condition of life that the riverside dwellers live in - lack of sanitation, need for adequate health care, eating habits, and precarious housing conditions. Knowing this reality, this study aims to discuss the promotion of health to riverside people. The research consists of a descriptive literature review conducted through databases. The riverine community needs basic resources such as sanitation, good quality electricity, and more frequent health care. They depend on urban areas to buy utensils, food, and other services that they need, and especially to have health care. To travel by boat on the river to the city takes hours or even days of travel. The river dwellers are susceptible to infectious diseases such as malaria, viral hepatitis, anemia, diseases caused by parasites, contamination through water and food, mercury contamination through fish, Chagas disease, diabetes, and hypertension. There are several programs already implemented that should reach all riverside communities, some of them are the Family Health Strategies (FHS), municipal, state and federal government authorities, Brazil without misery, citizenship territories, national food security plan, stork network , affectionate Brazil and smiling Brazil. Although they already provide care in part of these communities, extensions are needed to reach 100% of them, and thus prevent the spread of diseases and provide the right to health for all. Given this context, it is important to further improve the public policies aimed at the health of this population, to launch new strategies, and to improve the existing ones, taking into account the principle that health care must follow the direction of the specific needs of the groups, thus being a dynamic and permanent challenge. The riverside dwellers have the right to know and receive all the actions directed to them, ensuring the right to health in all dimensions included in the principles that organize and guide the SUS.

AB  - Triatoma brasiliensis macromelasoma occurs in Pernambuco state, Brazil, which is situated between the distribution areas of Triatoma brasiliensis brasiliensis (north) and Triatoma juazeirensis (south). T. b. macromelasoma displays greater variations in its chromatic phenotype than either T. b. brasiliensis or T. juazeirensis, and patterns reminiscent of one or the other. Experimental crosses from each of these members of the T. brasiliensis species complex generated fertile offspring suggesting that viable hybrids could be present in nature, despite their significant genetic distances. Considering the geographical position of occurrence of the T. b. macromelasoma (in Pernambuco) it was proposed to be an area capable of supporting natural hybridization between T. b. brasiliensis and T. juazeirensis. Since phenotypic variability is expected, this study investigated the existence of intermediate chromatic phenotypes for T. b. macromelasoma in various locations in areas between the T. b. brasiliensis and T. juazeirensis occurrences. Thirteen different color patterns were for the first time characterized and nine of those displayed intermediate phenotypes. Molecular analysis performed using ribosomal DNA intergenic region, grouped all within the T. brasiliensis complex. The intermediate chromatic phenotypes, molecular analysis and experimental crosses all support the distinction of a zone of hybridization that gave rise to the T. b. macromelasoma through homoploidal evolution.

AB  - Diagnosing canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is difficult because clinical signs of the disease are non-specific and a many infected animals in endemic areas, as in Brazil, are asymptomatic. Serological tests are the most common diagnostic methods employed, but most have limitations. For this reason, the implementation of a rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic test for CVL has become increasingly important. In this study, we adapted a chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CL ELISA), using two multi-epitope recombinant proteins (PQ10 and PQ20) and a crude Leishmania antigen produced using promastigotes of L. infantum, as antigens to detect CVL infection in animals from Belo Horizonte. To investigate cross-reactions, samples from dogs with other infections (babesiosis, ehrlichiosis and Trypanosoma cruzi) were tested. Assay performance validations were conducted to analyse parameters such as variability, reproducibility, and stability.
   CL ELISA sensitivity/specificity with PQ10 antigen was 93.1%/80.0%; with the PQ20 protein 93.1%/96.6%; and with the crude antigen 75%/73.3%. Inter-assay variability and inter-operator coefficient of variation were <7% and <15%, with PQ10 and PQ20, respectively. The accuracy of the CL ELISA was classified as excellent for PQ10 (AUC = 0.95) and PQ20 (AUC = 0.98) and moderate for the crude antigen (AUC = 0.77). The kappa score for qualitative agreement between two plate lots was excellent for PQ10 (0.89) and good for PQ20 (0.65). PQ20 remained more stable than PQ10. The CL ELISA with recombinant proteins is a promising tool to diagnose CVL. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In 722 cities of Minas Gerais (Brazil), primary care patients can have their ECGs remotely interpreted by cardiologists of the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG), a public telehealth service. As of December 2014, more than 1.9 million ECGs were interpreted. This study analyzed the database of all ECGs performed by the TNMG on primary care patients from 2009 to 2013 (n=1,101,993). Structured patient data and the results of automated ECG interpretation by the Glasgow Program are described. Mean patient age is 51 years old, 59% of them are women. The average body mass index is 25.9 kg/m(2), with an average increase of 0.15 kg/m(2) per civil year. Those patients notably have hypertension (33.2%), family history of coronary artery disease (14.5%), smoking (6.9%), diabetes (5.8%), obesity (5.8%) or Chagas Disease (3.0%). Seventy percent of ECGs are normal. This percentage is higher in women (72.3%) and decreases in average by 7.4 every 10 years of life. There are notably 12% of possible myocardial infarction, 10% of possible left ventricular hypertrophy and 8% of possible supraventricular extra systole.

AB  - Leishmania braziliensis is responsible for most cases of human tegumentary leishmaniasis (HTL) and has caused a wide range of clinical manifestations, including cutaneous (CL) and mucosal leishmaniasis (ML). The diagnosis is based on criteria that consider epidemiological data, clinical findings, and laboratory tests and is hard to establish. For laboratory tests, none of the assays available can be considered gold standards for disease detection. In addition, the Montenegro skin test, essential to supporting infectologists in the clinical management of the disease, is no longer available in Brazil. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop new targets to be used in diagnostic tests for HTL. In the first step, we carried out two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by mass spectrometry, combined with heat map analysis and immunoproteomics approach, and disclosed eight proteins expressed in the amastigote stage specifically recognized by serum from CL and ML patients. A chimeric protein was designed based on the combination of thirteen linear B-cell epitopes, identified by immunoinformatics analysis, from L. braziliensis proteins. Our results showed that the strategy used in this work was successful in developing an antigen to be used in immunological assays (100.0% sensitivity and specificity) in the detection of HTL cases and in comparison with results obtained from an ELISA using soluble L. braziliensis antigen (SLb-Antigen) and immunofluorescence assay (Bio-Manguinhos/FIOCRUZ). The present technology opens the door for its use in field exams by means of an immunochromatographic test, which will be even more helpful in regions without laboratory structures.

AB  - Background: Sexually transmitted diseases (STD) are frequently asymptomatic and increase the likelihood of transmitting and acquiring HIV. In Brazil, the guidelines for STDs diagnosis and treatment are based on the syndromic approach. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) has been recommended as routine STDs screening in some countries, especially for men who have sex with men (MSM). Limited data are available about how to best define target groups for routine screening by NAATs within this population. We aimed to assess the prevalence of rectal and urethral Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infections and syphilis, and the factors associated with having at least one STD among HIV-infected and uninfected MSM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   Methods: From August 2010 to June 2012, 391 MSM were enrolled into the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases-INI-Fiocruz cohort, and 292 MSM (HIV-infected: 211 and HIV-uninfected: 81) were included in this study. NAATs were performed on the rectal swabs and urine for CT and NG. The rapid plasma reagin test and microhemagglutination assay for Treponema pallidum were performed for syphilis diagnosis.
   Results: The overall prevalence of STD was 20.0 % (95% CI: 15.7-25.1): 10 % anorectal chlamydia; syphilis 9.9 %; anorectal gonorrheae 2.5 %; and urethral chlamydia 2.2 %; no case of urethral gonorrheae was detected. The proportion of HIV-positive MSM who had at least one STD was nearly two times that of HIV-negative MSM (22.6 % vs 13.2 %; P = 0.09). The frequency of each STD, except for anorectal NG (1.5 % vs. 5.2 %), was higher among HIV-positive than HIV-negative individuals. Among the 211 asymptomatic participants, 17.5 % (n = 37) were identified as having at least one STD; 10.4 % (n = 22/211) tested positive for anorectal chlamydia. Sixty five percent of HIV-positive MSM were asymptomatic at the time of the STD diagnosis, while 100.0 % of the HIV-negative MSM. Age (APR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.60-1.00 for each additional ten years) and a positive-HIV serostatus (APR = 2.05; 95% CI: 1.03-4.08) were significantly associated with STD diagnosis.
   Conclusion: An overall high STD-prevalence rate was observed, especially among HIV-infected and in younger individuals, and the majority of STDs were asymptomatic. STD screening using NAATs among asymptomatic MSM is a potentially cost-effective intervention for the prevention of HIV infection among MSM.

AB  - Triatoma sordida is among the main Brazilian species considered as Chagas disease vectors. The genetic studies are directed mainly to phylogenetic questions because this species possibly have suffered cryptic speciation. Furthermore, there are few studies that analyzed the structure and genetic variability of specimens from Brazil and that showed low genetic diversity and strong genetic structuring of the population samples. Therefore, because of great epidemiological importance of T. sordida and mainly the restriction of genetic characterization of this vector only for populations of Minas Gerais state, this article performs a genetic analysis of the T. sordida from seven different Brazilian states (representing different biomes), by means of cytogenetic markers. All analyzed specimens presents the same cytogenetic characteristics: early meiotic prophase with several heterochromatic bodies dispersed in the nucleus (CGrich), being one of them formed by the associated sex chromosomes surrounded by some autosomal heterochromatic regions, meiotic metaphase with most autosomal pairs exhibiting a C-heterochromatic block in one chromosomal end (CG-rich), Y sex chromosome fully heterochromatin (AT-rich), and X chromosome may present a small C-block (CG-rich). These results are important because the chromosomal markers enable to confirm and expand the low genetic diversity for all Brazilian states occupied by T. sordida, suggesting that all Brazilian populations were originated from a small ancestral population and possibly dispersed to other biomes by founder effect. In addition, we suggest that T. sordida from Brazil are not suffering cryptic speciation and we confirm the classification of all Brazilian examples as T. sordida sensu stricto.

AB  - Most vector-borne diseases exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, which clearly suggests that they are weather sensitive. Rainfall, temperature, and other climate variables affect in many ways both the vectors and the pathogens they transmit. Likewise, climate can be determinant in outbreaks incidence. A growing number of studies have provided evidence indicating the effects of climate variability on vector-borne diseases. However, oftentimes, the different diseases and regions are not uniformly represented, scarcity or lack of publications in some countries is common. The objectives of this work were to analyze the distribution and abundance of publications on vector-borne diseases associated with climate variability in South America, identify those works that conducted a geographic analysis and detect the countries where outbreaks occurred and the climate variables with which they were associated. A systematic review of the literature published on vector-borne diseases linked to climate variability in South America was conducted, identifying, evaluating and summarizing scientific papers. The distribution of the study areas and disease type in the publications were represented on maps. Dengue and leishmaniasis were the most studied and widely represented diseases in South America. The country with the largest number of published papers and presence of all disease types was Brazil. Outbreaks of disease were related to different climate variables. Most diseases from the publications under study occurred in equatorial and tropical climates. The disease represented by the largest number of different types of climates was dengue. The technique used in this work allowed us to determine the status of knowledge of the main diseases associated with climate variability in South America. This methodology could be improved in the future by incorporating other bibliographic sources as well as other diseases related to climate variability. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundLate antiretroviral treatment initiation for HIV disease worsens health outcomes and contributes to ongoing transmission. We investigated whether socioeconomic inequalities exist in access to treatment in a setting with universal access to care and treatment.MethodsThis study investigated the association of educational level, used as a proxy for socioeconomic status, with late treatment initiation and treatment initiation with advanced disease. Study participants included adults (>= 25years) who started treatment from 2005 to 2018 at Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas of FundacAo Oswaldo Cruz (INI/FIOCRUZ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Educational level was categorized following UNESCO's International Standard Classification of Education: incomplete basic education, basic education, secondary level, and tertiary level. We defined late treatment initiation as those initiating treatment with a CD4<350 cells/mL or an AIDS-defining event, and treatment initiation with advanced disease as those initiating treatment with a CD4<200 cells/mL or an AIDS-defining event. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) was constructed to represent the theoretical-operational model and to understand the involvement of covariates. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Multiple imputation using a chained equations approach was used to treat missing values and non-linear terms for continuous variables were tested.ResultsIn total, 3226 individuals composed the study population: 876 (27.4%) had incomplete basic education, 540 (16.9%) basic, 1251 (39.2%) secondary level, and 525 (16.4%) tertiary level. Late treatment initiation was observed for 2076 (64.4%) while treatment initiation with advanced disease was observed for 1423 (44.1%). Compared to tertiary level of education, incomplete basic, basic and secondary level increased the odds of late treatment initiation by 89% (aOR:1.89 95%CI:1.47-2.43), 61% (aOR:1.61 95%CI:1.23-2.10), and 35% (aOR:1.35 95%CI:1.09-1.67). Likewise, the odds of treatment initiation with advanced disease was 2.5-fold (aOR:2.53 95%CI:1.97-3.26), 2-fold (aOR:2.07 95%CI:1.59-2.71), 1.5-fold (aOR:1.51 95%CI:1.21-1.88) higher for those with incomplete basic, basic and secondary level education compared to tertiary level.ConclusionDespite universal access to HIV care and antiretroviral treatment, late treatment initiation and social inequalities persist. Lower educational level significantly increased the odds of both outcomes, reinforcing the existence of barriers to "universal" antiretroviral treatment.

AB  - Background
   Triatoma brasiliensis, a triatomine-bug vector of Chagas disease, evolved in the semiarid Caatinga, where it occupies rocky outcrops, shrubby cacti, and human dwellings. Dwellings and rocks are considered high-quality microhabitats for this saxicolous species, whereas cacti probably represent secondary, lower-quality microhabitats. This 'microhabitat-quality hierarchy' hypothesis predicts that T. brasiliensis populations occupying dwellings or rocks should endure harsh environmental conditions better than their cactus-living relatives.
   Methods/Findings
   We tested this prediction by comparing T. brasiliensis infestation (proportion of microhabitats with bugs), density (bugs per microhabitat), and crowding (bugs per infested microhabitat) in dwellings, rocks, and cacti sampled before and during the extreme drought that ravaged the Caatinga in 2012-2016. We used random-intercepts generalized linear mixed models to account for microhabitat spatial clustering and for variations in bug-catch effort; we assessed model performance and computed model-averaged effect estimates using Akaike's information criterion. Pre-drought infestation was similar across microhabitat types; during the drought, infestation remained stable in dwellings and rocks but dropped in cacti. Pre-drought bug density declined from dwellings to rocks to cacti; an additional decline associated with the drought was largely comparable across microhabitats, albeit perhaps somewhat larger in cacti. Finally, pre-drought bug crowding was higher in dwellings than in rocks or cacti and changed little during the drought-possibly with a downward trend in dwellings and an upward trend in cacti.
   Conclusions
   Triatoma brasiliensis populations fared better in dwellings and rocks than in cacti during extreme drought. Estimates of microhabitat and drought effects on infestation, density, and crowding suggest that only a few cacti (versus many rocks and dwellings) represent good-quality habitat under such extremely harsh conditions. Our findings provide empirical support to the microhabitat-quality hierarchy hypothesis, and imply that T. brasiliensis can endure extreme climate by exploiting high-quality microhabitats, whether wild or man-made, in the semiarid Caatinga.

AB  - In data analysis, the mining of frequent patterns plays an important role in the discovery of associations and correlations between data. During this process, it is common to produce thousands of association rules (ARs), making the study of each one arduous. This problem weakens the process of finding useful information. There is a scientific effort to develop approaches capable of filtering interesting patterns, balancing the number of ARs produced with the goal of not being trivial and known by specialists. However, even when such approaches are adopted, the number of produced ARs can still be high. This work contributes by presenting Divergent Association Rules Approach (DARA), a novel approach for obtaining ARs that presents themselves in divergence with the data distribution. DARA is applied right after traditional approaches to filtering interesting patterns. To validate our approach, we studied the dataset related to the occurrence of malaria in the Brazilian Legal Amazon. The discovered patterns highlight that ARs brought relevant insights from the data. This article contributes both in the medical and computer science fields since this novel computational approach enabled new findings regarding malaria in Brazil.

AB  - Stinkbugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) are of major economic importance as pest of crops. Among the species composing the stinkbug complex, Nezara viridula is one of the most abundant in Brazil, Argentina and the Southern USA. However, this species has been poorly characterized at the genetic and physiological level. Here we sequenced and analyzed the complete transcriptome of N. viridula male and female adults. We identified neuropeptide precursor genes and G-protein coupled receptors for neuropeptides in this transcriptome. Mature neuropeptides were identified in N. viridula brain extracts by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We also analyzed the neuropeptide precursor complement in the genome sequence of Halyomorpha halys, another pentatomid of economic relevance. We compared the results in both pentatomids with the well-characterized neuropeptide repertoire from the kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera: Reduviidae). We identified both group-specific features (which could be related to the different feeding habits) and similarities that could be characteristic of Heteroptera. This work contributes to a deeper knowledge of the genetic information of these pests, with a focus on neuroendocrine system characterization.

AB  - In the current effort to eliminate polio from the world, it is important to recognize and vaccinate susceptible groups, especially immunocompromised patients living in countries where attenuated polio vaccine is still used. In this report, we describe the frequency of protective antibodies in a small sample of adult SOT candidates in whom previous vaccination could be ascertained. Patients included in this report were selected among the participants of an ongoing prospective study carried out at the Reference Center for Special Immunobiologicals of the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Among the first 100 patients enrolled in this study, only seven adult SOT candidates had proven polio vaccination at childhood. Three of these seven patients (43%) had no protective antibody titers to one or more poliovirus subtype before solid organ transplant. Proven childhood vaccination against polio does not reliably provide lifelong protective antibody titers for adult SOT candidates and should not be used as a criterion to analyze the need for vaccination in this population.

AB  - Simple Summary A new species of Belminus, discovered during the study of unidentified Triatominae specimens from the Hemiptera collection of the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC, USA is described here. After comparison with previously described species, significant morphological and morphometric differences were observed, confirming the discovery of a new triatomine species, Belminus santosmalletae. Belminus santosmalletae, a new triatomine species, is described based on a specimen from Panama, deposited in the collection of the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH), Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC, USA. Attempts failed to identify this specimen using the keys by Lent and Wygodzinsky (1979) and Sandoval et al. (2007). A comparison was made with specimens of Belminus Stal, 1859 specimens deposited at the Triatominae collection at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (CTIOC), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and with previous descriptions of Belminus species. These comparisons showed the specimen represents a new species, described in the present paper. It differs from other species of the genus mainly by the grainy tegument, scarce pilosity along the body, and the number of tubercles observed on the pronotum.

AB  - Objectives: Enterobacter cloacae has recently emerged as an important agent of nosocomial infections owing to the dissemination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases in this species. In this context, a rise in the therapeutic use of aminoglycosides was noticed, followed by the accelerated development of resistance mechanisms. In this study, we report the draft genome sequence of a multidrug-resistant E. cloacae subsp. cloacae strain (Ec(2)) isolated from an active surveillance culture of a patient with Chagas disease.
   Methods: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using a Nextera XT DNA library and NextSeq platform.
   Results: WGS analysis revealed the presence of 5527 coding genes, 62 RNA-encoding genes and 275 pseudogenes. Strain Ec2 belongs to sequence type 395 (ST395) and carries 22 transferable antibiotic resistance genes, comprising eight antimicrobial classes, including the rmtD2 gene conferring high-level aminoglycoside resistance.
   Conclusions: This draft genome can be used in comparative genomic analyses with different E. cloacae strains. In addition, it could help at elucidating epidemiological aspects regarding the dissemination of clinically relevant resistance genes.

AB  - Background: Assessing trends in the rate of transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs) in blood donors is critical to the monitoring of the blood supply safety and the donor screening effectiveness. The objective of this study was to conduct a trend analysis of TTIs and associated demographic factors of donors at a public blood bank in the central Brazil.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis (2010-2016) of blood donation data was performed to determine the prevalence of markers for TTIs. Multinomial and multivariate logistic regression were used to verify the association between the explanatory variables and TTIs. The trend was evaluated with the Prais Winsten's regression analysis.
   Results: The prevalence of TTIs was 4.04% (5,553 donors) among 137,209 donors, with a steady trend in the analyzed period. The seroprevalence for the hepatitis B virus (HBV), syphilis, hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Chagas disease, and human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) were 1.63%, 0.87%, 0.46%, 0.21%, 0.21% and 0.09%, respectively. The prevalence of HBV decreased (b = -0.021, p < 0.001), while syphilis increased (b = 0.112; p = 0.001), during the period investigated. The probability for a positive test for TTI was higher among donors with a low level of education, aged >= 30 years old, without stable marital status, and first-time donors.
   Conclusions: Even with the reduction in HBV, the increased rate of syphilis may have contributed to the fact that the overall rate of TTIs did not decrease in the evaluated period. (C) 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia Celular. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

AB  - Background
   Intestinal parasitic infections remain among the most common infectious diseases worldwide. This study aimed to estimate their prevalence and provide a detailed analysis of geographical distribution of intestinal parasites in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro, considering demographic, socio-economic, and epidemiological contextual factors.
   Methods/ Principal findings
   The cross-section survey was conducted among individuals attending the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (FIOCRUZ, RJ) during the period from April 2012 to February 2015. Stool samples were collected and processed by sedimentation, flotation, Kato-Katz, Baermann-Moraes and Graham methods, iron haematoxylin staining and safranin staining. Of the 3245 individuals analysed, 569 (17.5%) were infected with at least one parasite. The most common protozoa were Endolimax nana (28.8%), Entamoeba coli (14.8%), Complex Entamoeba histolytica/Entamoeba dispar (13.5%), Blastocystis hominis (12.7%), and Giardia lamblia (8.1%). Strongyloides stercoralis (4.3%), Schistosoma mansoni (3.3%), Ascaris lumbricoides (1.6%), and hookworms (1.5%) were the most frequent helminths. There was a high frequency of contamination by protozoa (87%), and multiple infections were observed in 141 participants (24.8%). A positive association between age (young children) and gender (male) with intestinal parasites was observed. Geospatial distribution of the detected intestinal parasitic infections was not random or homogeneous, but was influenced by socioeconomic conditions (through the material deprivation index (MDI)). Participants classified in the highest levels of deprivation had higher risk of having intestinal parasites.
   Conclusions/Significance
   This study provides the first epidemiological information on the prevalence and distribution of intestinal parasitic infections in the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area. Intestinal parasites, especially protozoa, are highly prevalent, indicating that parasitic infections are still a serious public health problem. MDI showed that intestinal parasites were strongly associated with the socioeconomic status of the population, thus making it possible to identify social vulnerable areas.

AB  - Urban parks are areas designated for human recreation but also serve as shelter and refuge for populations of several species of native fauna, both migratory and introduced. In Brazil, the effect of annual climate variations on Aedes aegypti and dengue epidemics in large cities like Sao Paulo is well known, but little is known about how such variations can affect the diversity of mosquito vectors in urban parks and the risk of disease transmission by these vectors. This study investigates the influence of larval habitats and seasonal factors on the diversity and abundance of Culicidae fauna in Anhanguera Park, one of the largest remaining green areas in the city of Sao Paulo. Species composition and richness and larval habitats were identified. Seasonality (cold-dry and hot-rainy periods) and year were considered as explanatory variables and the models selection approach was developed to investigate the relationship of these variables with mosquito diversity and abundance. A total of 11,036 specimens from 57 taxa distributed in 13 genera were collected. Culex nigripalpus, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Aedes albopictus were the most abundant species. Bamboo internodes and artificial breeding sites showed higher abundance, while ponds and puddles showed greater richness. Significant relationships were observed between abundance and seasonality, with a notable increase in the mosquitos abundance in the warm-rainy periods. The Shannon and Berger Parker indices were related with interaction between seasonality and year, however separately these predictors showed no relationship with ones. The increased abundance of mosquitoes in warm-rainy months and the fact that some of the species are epidemiologically important increase not only the risk of pathogen transmission to people who frequent urban parks but also the nuisance represented by insect bites. The findings of this study highlight the importance of knowledge of culicid ecology in green areas in urban environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The efficacy of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) therapy has already been established in clinical trials but their effectiveness in several clinical settings remains undetermined. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of ICD and CRT-D therapies within the Brazilian National Health System (SUS).
   Methods: All patients who underwent ICD or CRT-D implantation within the SUS from 2001 to 2007 were included in the study. We compared estimated Kaplan-Meier survival curves using the Peto's test. Prognostic factors were selected using Cox's models.
   Results: There were included 3,295 patients in the ICD group and 681 patients in the CRT-D group. Cardiac causes accounted for 79% of all deaths in both groups and Chagas' heart disease accounted for 31% of these deaths. In the CRT-D group, survival significantly decreased around the fourth year of follow-up, with a decrease from 59.5% to 38.3% in 5.5 months. Transvenous implantation technique was used in 62% of CRT-D patients. In-hospital case-fatality rates were higher in those undergoing surgical implantation (5.3%) than those undergoing transvenous implantation (1.6%) (p = 0.02).
   Conclusions: The results show that short-term, medium-term and long-term effectiveness of ICD therapy appears to be similar to that evidenced in clinical trials. In the CRT-D group, in-hospital case-fatality and 30-day case-fatality were higher than those reported in other studies. Surgical epicardial implantation technique was performed in this group at a higher frequency than that reported in the literature and was associated with poorer short-term prognosis.

KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) (also known as cutaneous leishmaniasis [CL]) is caused by various species of protozoa of the genus Leishmania. The diagnosis is achieved on a clinical, epidemiological, and pathological basis, supported by positive parasitological exams and demonstration of leishmanin delayed-type hypersensitivity. Serological assays are not routinely used in the diagnosis because many are considered to have low sensitivity and the particular Leishmania species causing the disease can lead to variable performance. In the present study, we generated recombinant versions of two highly conserved Leishmania proteins, Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis-derived Lb8E and Lb6H, and evaluated both in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Recombinant Lb6H (rLb6H) had better performance and reacted with 100.0% of the ATL and 89.4% of the VL samples. These reactions with rLb6H were highly specific (98.5%) when compared against those for samples from healthy control individuals. We then assessed rLb6H against sera from ATL patients infected with different species of Leishmania prevalent in Brazil [Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis, L. (Viannia) braziliensis, and L. (V.) guyanensis] and samples from patients with other infectious diseases. In analyses of 500 sera, ELISA using rLb6H detected all 219 ATL samples (sensitivity of 100.0%) with an overall specificity of 93.9% (considering healthy individuals and other infectious diseases patients). Only a minority of samples from Chagas disease patients possessed antibodies against rLb6H, and all of these responses were low (with a highest reactivity index of 2.2). Taken together, our data support further evaluation of rLb6H and the potential for its routine use in the serological diagnosis of ATL.

AB  - Background: The Sordida subcomplex (Triatominae) comprises four species, Triatoma garciabesi, T. guasayana, T. patagonica and T. sordida, which differ in epidemiological importance and adaptations to human environments. Some morphological similarities among species make taxonomic identification, population differentiation and species delimitation controversial. Triatoma garciabesi and T. sordida are the most similar species, having been considered alternatively two and a single species until T. garciabesi was re-validated, mostly based on the morphology of male genitalia. More recently, T. sordida from Argentina has been proposed as a new cryptic species distinguishable from T. sordida from Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay by cytogenetics. We studied linear and geometric morphometry of the head, wings and pronotum in populations of these species aiming to find phenotypic markers for their discrimination, especially between T. sordida and T. garciabesi, and if any set of variables that validates T. sordida from Argentina as a new species.
   Results: Head width and pronotum length were the linear variables that best differentiated species. Geometric morphometry revealed significant Mahalanobis distances in wing shape between all pairwise comparisons. Triatoma patagonica exhibited the best discrimination and T. garciabesi overlapped the distribution of the other species in the morphometric space of the first two DFA axes. Head shape showed differentiation between all pairs of species except for T. garciabesi and T. sordida. Pronotum shape did not differentiate T. garciabesi from T. guasayana. The comparison between T. garciabesi and T. sordida from Argentina and T. sordida from Brazil and Bolivia revealed low differentiation based on head and pronotum linear measurements. Pronotum and wing shape were different between T. garciabesi and T. sordida from Brazil and Bolivia and T. sordida from Argentina. Head shape did not differentiate T. garciabesi from T. sordida from Argentina.
   Conclusions: Wing shape best delimited the four species phenotypically. The proposed cryptic species, T. sordida from Argentina, differed from T. sordida from Brazil and Bolivia in all measured shape traits, suggesting that the putative new species may not be cryptic. Additional studies integrating cytogenetic, phenotypic and molecular markers, as well as cross-breeding experiments are needed to confirm if these three entities represent true biological species.

AB  - Two types of Epstein Barr virus (EBV1/EBV2) have been shown to infect humans. Although their genomes are similar, the regions containing the EBNA genes differ. This study aimed to characterize the EBV genotypes of infectious mononucleosis (IM) cases in the metropolitan region of Belem, Brazil, from 2005 to 2016. A total of 8295 suspected cases with symptoms/signs of IM were investigated by infectious disease physicians at Evandro Chagas Institute, Health Care Service, from January 2005 to December 2016. Out of the total, 1645 (19.8%) samples had positive results for EBV by enzyme immunoassay and 251 (15.3%) were submitted to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, using the EBNA3C region, in order to determine the type of EBV. Biochemical testing involving aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and gammaglutamyl transferase were also performed. EBV type was identified by PCR in 30.3% (76/251) of individuals; of those, 71.1% (54/76) were classified as EBV1, 17.1% (13/76) as EBV2, and 11.8% (9/76) as EBV1 + EBV2. The main symptoms/signs observed with EBV1 infection were cervical lymphadenopathy (64.8%, 35/54), fever (63%, 34/54), headache (20.4%, 11/54), arthralgia (20.4%, 11/54), and exanthema (18.5%, 10/54). EBV2 infection was detected in all but two age groups, with an average age of 24 years. The most common signs/symptoms of EBV2 were fever (76.9%, 10/13), average duration of 18 days, and lymphadenopathy (69.2%, 9/13). In contrast, EBV1 + EBV2 coinfections were more frequent in those aged five years or less (20.0%, 2/10). The symptoms of EBV1 + EBV2 coinfection included fever (66.7%, 6/9), and cervical lymphadenopathy and headache (33.3%, 3/9) each. The mean values of hepatic enzymes according to type of EBV was significantly different (p <0.05) in those EBV1 infected over 14 years of age. Thus, this pioneering study, using molecular methods, identified the EBV genotypes in 30.3% of the samples, with circulation of EBV1, EBV2, and EBV1 + EBV2 coinfection in cases of infectious mononucleosis in the northern region of Brazil.

AB  - Introduction: The ecoepidemiological situation in the State of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil is characterized by frequent invasion and colonization of domiciliary units (DUs) by several triatomine species, with high rates of natural infection by Typanosoma cruzi. Methods: We evaluated the possibility of vector transmission of T. cruzi based on records of the occurrence of domiciled triatomines collected by the Secretariat of State for Public Health from 2005 to 2015. During this period. 67.7% (113/167) of municipalities conducted at least one active search and 110 recorded the presence of insects in DUs. These activities were more frequent in municipalities considered to have a high and medium-level risk of T. cruzi transmission. Results: Of 51,569 captured triatomines, the most common species were Triatoma brasiliensis (47.2%) and T. pseudomaculata (40.2%). Colonies of T. brasiliensis, T. pseudomaculata, T. petrocchiae, Panstrongylus lutzi, and Rhodnius nasutus were also recorded in the intradomicile and peridomicile. Natural infection by trypanosomatids was detected in 1,153 specimens; the highest rate was found in R. nasutus (3.5%), followed by T. brasiliensis (2.5%) and T. pseudomaculata (2.4%). There have been high levels of colonization over the years; however, not all infested DUs have been sprayed. Conclusions: This is the first report of intradomicile and peridomicile colonization by P. lutzi. These results demonstrate the risk of new cases of infection by T. cruzi and reinforce the need for continuous entomological surveillance in the State of Rio Grande do Norte.

AB  - Organic compounds obtained by click chemistry reactions have demonstrated a broad spectrum of biological activities being widely applied for the development of molecules against pathogens of medical and veterinary importance. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), caused by intracellular protozoa parasite of genus Leishmania, comprises a complex of clinical manifestations that affect the skin and mucous membranes. The available drugs for the treatment are toxic and costly, with long periods of treatment, and the emergence of resistant strains has been reported. In this study we investigated the in vitro effects of a phthalimide-1,2,3-triazole derivative, the 4-Phenyl-1-[2-(phthalimido-2-yl)ethyl]-1H-1,2,3-triazole (PT4) obtained by click chemistry, on mammalian cells and on L. amazonensis and L. braziliensis, the causative agents of CL in Brazil. In silico ADMET evaluation of PT4 showed that this molecule has good pharmacokinetic properties with no violation of Lipinski's rules. The in vitro assays showed that PT4 was more selective for both Leishmania species than to mammalian cells. This compound also presented low cytotoxicity to mammalian cells with CC50 > 500 mu M. Treatment of promastigote forms with different concentrations of PT4 resulted in ultrastructural alterations, such as plasma membrane wrinkling, shortening of cell body, increased cell volume and cell rupture. The molecular dynamic simulations showed that PT4 interacts with Lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase from Leishmania, an essential enzyme of lipid synthesis pathway in this parasite. Our results demonstrated PT4 was effective against both species of Leishmania. PT4 caused a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased production of reactive oxygen species, which may lead to parasite death. Taken together, our results pointed PT4 as promissing therapeutic agent against CL.

AB  - Canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) diagnosis is still a challenge in endemic areas with limited diagnostic resources. This study proposes a score with the potential to distinguish positive CVL cases from negative ones. We studied 265 dogs that tested positive for CVL on ELISA and parasitological tests. A score ranging between 0 and 19 was recorded on the basis of clinical signs. Dogs with CVL had an overall higher positivity of the majority of clinical signs than did dogs without CVL or with ehrlichiosis. Clinical signs such as enlarged lymph nodes (83.93%), muzzle/ear lesions (55.36%), nutritional status (51.79%), bristle condition (57.14%), pale mucosal colour (48.21%), onychogryphosis (58.93%), skin lesion (39.28%), bleeding (12.50%), muzzle depigmentation (41.07%), alopecia (39.29%), blepharitis (21.43%), and keratoconjunctivitis (42.86%) were more frequent in dogs with CVL than in dogs with ehrlichiosis or without CVL. Moreover, the clinical score increased according to the positivity of all diagnostic tests (ELISA, p < 0.001; parasite culture, p = 0.0021; and smear, p = 0.0003). Onychogryphosis (long nails) [odds ratio (OR): 3.529; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.832-6.796; p < 0.001], muzzle depigmentation (OR: 4.651; 95% CI: 2.218-9.750; p < 0.001), and keratoconjunctivitis (OR: 5.400; 95% CI: 2.549-11.441; p < 0.001) were highly associated with CVL. Interestingly, a score cut-off value = 6 had an area under the curve of 0.717 (p < 0.0001), sensitivity of 60.71%, and specificity of 73.64% for CVL diagnosis. The clinical sign-based score for CVL diagnosis suggested herein can help veterinarians reliably identify dogs with CVL in endemic areas with limited diagnostic resources.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Predonation donor deferral is used to select donors with presumed lower risk for transfused transmitted infections. The contribution to blood safety from this practice has not been reported previously for Brazil.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: At four large Brazilian blood centers from September 2010 to March 2011, donors who were deferred due to responses on eligibility questions were invited to provide a blood sample to test for HIV, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, human T-lymphotropic virus, syphilis, and Trypanosoma cruzi and complete an audio computer-assisted structured interview on risk behaviors.
   RESULTS: Of 299,848 potential donors during the study period, 66,870 were deferred with 10,453 (15.6%) for high-risk behaviors. Of those, 4860 (46.5%) were consecutively approached and 4013 (82.5%) participated. Disclosed risk behaviors by audio computer-assisted structured interview included 4 or more sexual partners in the past 12 months (15.0% of females [F] and 34.5% of males [M]), unprotected sex (62.0% F and 44.0% M), other high-risk sexual exposure (85.0% F and 73.0% M), being a person who injects drugs (3.0% F and 10.0% M), and test-seeking (17.0% F and 22.0% M). Eleven percent of deferred males reported male-to-male sex. Individuals who reported other high-risk sexual exposure, sexual partner risk, or male-to-male sex had the highest frequency of confirmed HIV: 1.2, 0.7, and 0.7%, respectively. Individuals who reported male-to-male sex, sexual partner risk, test seeking, and unprotected sex had the highest frequency of confirmed syphilis: 3.8, 3.3, 2.4, and 2.0%, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: Donor deferral deters donation by individuals with risk behaviors and elevated rates of infectious disease markers.

AB  - The serodiagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) presents problems related to its sensitivity and/or specificity. In the present study, a new Leishmania-specific hypothetical protein, LiHyD, was produced as a recombinant protein (rLiHyD) and evaluated in ELISA experiments for the CVL serodiagnosis. LiHyD was characterized as antigenic in a recent immunoproteomic search performed with Leishmania infantum proteins and the sera of dogs developing visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Aiming to compare the efficacy between whole proteins and synthetic peptides, two linear and one conformational B cell epitopes of LiHyD were synthesized and also evaluated as diagnostic markers. The four antigens were recognized by the sera of dogs suffering VL. On the contrary, low reactivity was observed when they were assayed with sera from non-infected healthy dogs living in endemic or non-endemic areas of leishmaniasis. In addition, no reactivity was found against them using sera from dogs experimentally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi, Babesia canis, or Ehrlichia canis, or sera from animals vaccinated with the Leish-TecA (R) vaccine, a prophylactic preparation commercially available for CVL prevention in Brazil. As comparative diagnostic tools, a recombinant version of the amastigote-specific A2 protein and a soluble crude Leishmania extract were studied. Both antigens presented lower sensitivity and/or specificity values than the LiHyD-based products. The rLiHyD presented better results for the CVL serodiagnosis than its linear epitopes, although the peptide recreating the conformational epitope resulted also appropriate as a diagnostic marker of CVL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing the use of a conformational epitope derived from a Leishmania protein for serodiagnosis of CVL.

AB  - Background: Policy makers and health practitioners are in need of guidance to respond to the growing geographic mobility of Hispano-American migrants in Europe. Drawing from contributions from epidemiology, social sciences, demography, psychology, psychiatry and economy, this scoping review provides an up-to-date and comprehensive synthesis of studies addressing the health status and determinants of this population. We describe major research gaps and suggest specific avenues of further inquiry.
   Methods: We identified systematically papers that addressed the concepts "health" and "Hispano Americans" indexed in five data bases from Jan 1990 to May 2014 with no language restrictions. We screened the 4,464 citations retrieved against exclusion criteria and classified 193 selected references in 12 thematic folders with the aid of the reference management software ENDNOTE X6. After reviewing the full text of all papers we extracted relevant data systematically into a table template to facilitate the synthesising process.
   Results: Most studies focused on a particular disease, leaving unexplored the interlinkages between different health conditions and how these relate to legislative, health services, environmental, occupational, and other health determinants. We elucidated some consistent results but there were many heterogeneous findings and several popular beliefs were not fully supported by empirical evidence. Few studies adopted a trans-national perspective and many consisted of cross-sectional descriptions that considered "Hispano-Americans" as a homogeneous category, limiting our analysis. Our results are also constrained by the availability and varying quality of studies reviewed.
   Conclusions: Burgeoning research has produced some consistent findings but there are huge gaps in knowledge. To prevent unhelpful generalisations we need a more holistic and nuanced understanding of how mobility, ethnicity, income, gender, legislative status, employment status, working conditions, neighbourhood characteristics and social status intersect with demographic variables and policy contexts to influence the health of the diverse Hispano-American populations present in Europe.

AB  - Viral metagenomics is widely applied to characterize emerging viral pathogens but it can also reveal the virome composition in health and disease. The evaluation of the virome in healthy blood donors can provide important knowledge on possible transfusion threats. Currently, there is still a paucity of information regarding the virome of blood donors who test positive for routinely tested blood-borne infections. Such analysis may reveal co-infections which in turn appear to be crucial for transfusion medicine and for patient management. The aim of this study was to evaluate the metavirome in blood donors who tested positive for routinely tested blood-borne infections, the information for which is important for transfusion medicine and blood donor management. For this purpose, we analyzed 18 blood donations obtained from HIV and HBV-infected blood donors from the Brazilian Amazon (Amapa state) and 11 HIV, HBV, HCV, syphilis and Chagas disease positive blood donations obtained from blood donors sampled in South Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul state). We additionally included a control group of 20 blood donors obtained from Southeast Brazil (State of Sao Paulo). Samples were assembled in pools and sequenced by the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. To link a given virus with geographic region or type of blood donor, we performed supervised machine learning classification (fingerprint analysis). The virome of both locations was predominantly composed of commensal viruses. However, in HBV-infected blood donors from the Brazilian Amazon, the Human Pegivirus-1 (HPgV-1) reads were prevailing, while in HIV-infected donors from the same location, the torque teno virus (TTV) reads expressive abundance. In blood donors from South Brazil, the most abundant reads were classified as Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K). Putative emerging viruses like the Human gemykibivirus-2 (HuGkV-2) were exclusively identified in samples from the Brazilian Amazon. The fingerprint analysis demonstrated that the HERV-K, TTV-7, 13, and 15 were statistically important for the infected blood donors, while TTV-5, 12 and 20 were linked to geographic localization. Our study revealed differences in the viral composition among blood donors who tested positive for routinely tested blood-borne infections from two different Brazilian regions and indicated the presence of putative emerging viruses in samples obtained from the Amazon. Together our results show that the presence of specific commensal viruses may be related donor infection status but additional investigations including larger study groups and samples from other Brazilian regions are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - This paper focuses on our research and intervention in health promotion with patients and communities affected by various infectious diseases, in the project Knowledge-Sharing Platform. This project is developed at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Evandro Chagas in the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and promotes the continuing involvement of health researchers and professionals in the collaborative production of knowledge on health with patients and community groups and in their training as community health promoters. The new epidemic scenario created the demand for a space of dialogue and knowledge-sharing on the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Due to the interruption of regular activities in the Knowledge-Sharing Platform, a strategy was launched to serve as a link between science and society and help overcome the social isolation imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The WhatsApp group allowed project members to participate by addressing questions (audio) on COVID-19 through mediation by community group leaders. The main questions by participants related to risk factors, transmission, immunity to the novel coronavirus, care related to prevention, symptoms, and treatment; and COVID-19 and influenza vaccine. The educational material Caring in the Age of COVID-19 was produced and shared with community leaders and distributed to the respective groups and was eventually shared in their communities as a response to a demand for knowledge that responds to the concerns of people already exposed to structural vulnerability.

AB  - Triatoma maculata and T. pseudomaculata are allopatric; however, it is believed that T. maculata was introduced into the Brazilian northeast by passive transportation of the nymphs between the feathers of migratory birds, followed by the speciation of T. pseudomaculata. T. pseudomaculata is the second most epidemiologically important species in the northeast of Brazil after T. brasiliensis. Therefore, given the broad range of T. pseudomaculata, the objective of the present study was to cytogenetically analyze different populations of T. pseudomaculata from different Brazilian states in order to investigate possible intraspecific chromosomal variation between them. Three adult T. pseudomaculata males from each population (Pernambuco, Ceara, Paraiba, Bahia, Rio Grande do Norte, and Piaui) were analyzed by lacto-acetic orcein and C-banding. All of the specimens analyzed exhibited the same cytogenetic characteristics, i.e., 22 chromosomes (20 autosomes and XY), a chromocenter formed by the X and Y sex chromosomes and one pair of autosomes, and heterochromatin blocks in three or four pairs of autosomes. These data confirm that all of the populations analyzed were T. pseudomaculata, and although they may be subject to different selection pressures they have maintained the genetic integrity that characterizes the species.

AB  - We provide in this study a very large DNA dataset on Rhodnius species including 36 samples representing 16 valid species of the three Rhodnius groups, pictipes, prolixus and pallescens. Samples were sequenced at low-depth with whole-genome shotgun sequencing (Illumina technology). Using phylogenomics including 15 mitochondrial genes (13.3 kb), partial nuclear rDNA (5.2 kb) and 51 nuclear protein-coding genes (36.3 kb), we resolve sticking points in the Rhodnius phylogeny. At the species level, we confirmed the species-specific status of R. montenegrensis and R. marabaensis and we agree with the synonymy of R. taquarussuensis with R. neglectus. We also invite to revisit the species-specific status of R. milesi that is more likely R. nasutus. We proposed to define a robustus species complex that comprises the four close relative species: R. marabaensis, R. montenegrensis, R. prolixus and R. robustus. As Psammolestes tertius was included in the Rhodnius clade, we strongly recommend reclassifying this species as R. tertius. At the Rhodnius group level, molecular data consistently supports the clustering of the pictipes and pallescens groups, more related to each other than they are to the prolixus group. Moreover, comparing mitochondrial and nuclear tree topologies, our results demonstrated that various introgression events occurred in all the three Rhodnius groups, in laboratory strains but also in wild specimens. We demonstrated that introgressions occurred frequently in the prolixus group, involving the related species of the robustus complex but also the pairwise R. nasutus and R. neglectus. A genome wide analysis highlighted an introgression event in the pictipes group between R. stali and R. brethesi and suggested a complex gene flow between the three species of the pallescens group, R. colombiensis, R. pallescens and R. ecuadoriensis. The molecular data supports also a sylvatic distribution of R. prolixus in Brazil (Para state) and the monophyly of R. robustus. As we detected extensive introgression events and selective pressure on mitochondrial genes, we strongly recommend performing separate mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies and to take advantages of mito-nuclear conflicts in order to have a comprehensive evolutionary vision of this genus.

AB  - Author summary Chagas disease (CD) is a serious public health problem in Latin America and has a strong social impact worldwide. Up to 30% of the infected people may have cardiac alterations, which are associated with a worse prognosis and with high mortality rates. The occurrence of CD is associated with contexts of social vulnerability. However, no studies have been identified that assessed whether unfavorable social contexts are related to the prognosis and evolution of CD, which is the purpose of our study. We evaluated 1,637 patients with CD who lived in 21 municipalities located in regions to which CD is endemic in Brazil, over a two-year period. Of these people, 12.5% evolved into a worse prognosis. Our study revealed that socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals were not isolated protagonists of the evolution of CD. The context in which individuals lived was also a determining factor of a worse prognosis, including living in municipalities with a smaller rural population, fewer physicians, and a smaller Primary Health Care (PHC) coverage. Thus, we observed that characteristics related to the health care available in the municipalities influenced the evolution of CD. This knowledge has the potential to support health care planning that is more appropriate for the evolution of patients with CD, especially considering poor and remote regions.
   The present study aims to investigate how the social context contributes to the prognosis of Chagas disease (CD). This is a multilevel study that considered individual and contextual data. Individual data came from a Brazilian cohort study that followed 1,637 patients who lived in 21 municipalities to which CD is endemic, over two years. Contextual data were collected from official Brazilian government databases. The dependent variable wasthe occurrence of cardiovascular events in CDduring the two-year follow-up, defined from the grouping of three possible combined events: death, development of atrial fibrillation, or pacemaker implantation. Analysis was performed using multilevel binary logistic regression. Among the individuals evaluated, 205 (12.5%) manifested cardiovascular events in CD during two years of follow-up. Individuals living in municipalities with a larger rural population had protection for these events (OR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.4-0.7), while those residing in municipalities with fewer physicians per thousand inhabitants (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2-2.5) and those living in municipalities with lower Primary Health Care (PHC) coverage (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.1-2.1) had higher chances of experiencing cardiovascular events. Among the individual variables, the probability of experiencing cardiovascular events was higher for individuals aged over 60 years (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.01-2.2), with no stable relationship (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 0.98-2.1), without previous treatment with Benznidazole (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 0.98-2.9), with functional class limitation (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.4-2.9), with a QRS complex duration longer than 120 ms (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.1-2.3), and in individuals with high NT-proBNP levels (OR = 6.4; 95% CI = 4.3-9.6). CONCLUSION: The present study showed that the occurrence of cardiovascular events in individuals with CD is determined by individual conditions that express the severity of cardiovascular involvement. However, these individual characteristics are not isolated protagonists of this outcome, and the context in which individuals live, are also determining factors for a worse clinical prognosis.

AB  - Background: Chagasic megaesophagus (CM) as well as the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) has been reported as etiological factors for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Objective: We assessed the prevalence of HPV DNA in a series of ESCCs associated or not with CM. Data obtained were further correlated to the pathological and clinical data of affected individuals. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 92 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues collected from patients referred to 3 different hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil: Barretos Cancer Hospital, Barretos, Sao Paulo; Federal University of Triangulo Mineiro, Uberaba, Minas Gerais; and Sao Paulo State University, Botucatu, Sao Paulo. Cases were divided into 3 groups: (i) 24 patients with CM associated with ESCC (CM/ESCC); (ii) 37 patients with ESCC without CM (ESCC); and (iii) 31 patients with CM without ESCC (CM). Detection of HPV DNA was assessed in all samples by a genotyping assay combining multiplex polymerase chain reaction and bead-based Luminex technology. Results: We identified a high prevalence of high-risk HPV in patients in the CM group (12/31, 38.8%) and CM/ESCC (8/24, 33.3%), compared to individuals in the ESCC group (6/37, 16.3%). The individuals in the groups with cancer (ESCC and CM/ESCC) had a higher frequency of HPV-16 (4/9, 44.5% and 2/8, 25.0%). The other types of high-risk HPVs detected were HPV-31, 45, 51, 53, 56, 66, and 73. We also observed in some samples HPV coinfection by more than one viral type. Despite the high incidence of HPV, it did not show any association with the patient's clinical-pathological and molecular (TP53 mutation status) characteristics. Conclusion: This is the first report of the presence of HPV DNA in CM associated with ESCC. HPV infection was more presence in megaesophagus lesions. Further studies are needed to confirm and better understand the role of persistent HPV infection in patients with CM.

AB  - Introduction: In December 2019, the first group of patients with symptoms of atypical pneumonia was discovered in Wuhan, China. On January 7, 2020, the etiologic agent was identified; it was a new betacoronavirus, genetically similar to SARS-CoV-1, consisting of a simple RNA strand, an enveloped virus of 50-200nm in diameter, which was called SARS-CoV-2. Soon after, the disease was named COVID-19. On January 30, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Importance due to the spread of the coronavirus. Tests for serological detection of IgM and IgG antibodies are those that provide an estimate of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT), simple and accessible with a result within 5-30 minutes, based on sensitization of antigens/antibodies conjugated to colloidal gold capturing specific proteins present in the infected serum, plasma or blood. Objective: This work aims to show the analysis carried out with RDT for COVID-19 diagnosis in compliance with the current legislation from 02.04 to 18.08.2020. Method: In March of 2020, 25 serum/plasma samples were donated, without any identification. These samples were the remaining samples of tests performed on individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by the RT-PCR technique from health services (National Institute of Infectious Diseases Evandro Chagas - INI and State Institute of the Brain Paulo Niemeyer - IEC) located in the metropolitan region of the state of Rio de Janeiro. The samples obtained in order to become a serological panel were stored at -20 degrees C until the moment of use. Simultaneously, a panel of samples with confirmed reactivity for IgM and IgG antibodies from COVID-19 was being made, throughout the pandemic and the samples used were evaluated against three Rapid Tests, of different antigenic compositions or different brands; two ELISA tests for IgM and IgG; two chemiluminescence tests and when applicable, a molecular test. In order to assess the specificity of the products sent, surplus donation plasma samples were selected, known to be negative for HIV, HTLV, hepatitis b and c, chagas and syphilis, collected between 2013 and 2014, in the southern regions of the country, period in which SARS-CoV-2 was nonexistent in the world. In addition to True Positive (VP) and True Negative (VN) samples, interfering serum or plasma samples with reactivity for HIV, HCV, HTLV, HBsAg, chagas disease, syphilis and dengue were also included in the evaluation. Results: Out of 178 TR lots, 74.1%, 132 lots were from China and 25.9%, 46 TR lots were from Brazil; Germany; South Korea; Canada; USA; Singapore; Ireland and Switzerland. The analytical result showed that 57.0%, 101 TR lots obtained a Satisfactory result and 43%, 77 lots had Unsatisfactory results, when compared to the Sensitivity and Specificity values declared by the manufacturer, in the Instructions for Use. Conclusions: The results obtained show the need for constant monitoring of TRs for COVID-19 with the primary purpose of guaranteeing the quality of products sold in the country, one of the National Health Surveillance System pillars of action.

AB  - Companion vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) are an important threat for pet life, but may also have an impact on human health, due to their often zoonotic character. The importance and awareness of CVBDs continuously increased during the last years. However, information on their occurrence is often limited in several parts of the world, which are often especially affected. Latin America (LATAM), a region with large biodiversity, is one of these regions, where information on CVBDs for pet owners, veterinarians, medical doctors and health workers is often obsolete, limited or non-existent. In the present review, a comprehensive literature search for CVBDs in companion animals (dogs and cats) was performed for several countries in Central America (Belize, Caribbean Islands, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico) as well as in South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana (British Guyana), Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, Venezuela) regarding the occurrence of the following parasitic and bacterial diseases: babesiosis, heartworm disease, subcutaneous dirofilariosis, hepatozoonosis, leishmaniosis, trypanosomosis, anaplasmosis, bartonellosis, borreliosis, ehrlichiosis, mycoplasmosis and rickettsiosis. An overview on the specific diseases, followed by a short summary on their occurrence per country is given. Additionally, a tabular listing on positive or non-reported occurrence is presented. None of the countries is completely free from CVBDs. The data presented in the review confirm a wide distribution of the CVBDs in focus in LATAM. This wide occurrence and the fact that most of the CVBDs can have a quite severe clinical outcome and their diagnostic as well as therapeutic options in the region are often difficult to access and to afford, demands a strong call for the prevention of pathogen transmission by the use of ectoparasiticidal and anti-feeding products as well as by performing behavioural changes.

AB  - Introduction and objectives: Heart failure is a major public health concern. The aim of this review was to estimate the burden of heart failure in Latin America.
   Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis following a search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and CENTRAL for articles published between January 1994 and June 2014, with no language restrictions. We included experimental and observational studies with at least 50 participants aged >= 18 years.
   Results: In total, 143 of the 4792 references retrieved were included in the study. Most studies had been conducted in South America (92%), and mainly in Brazil (64%). The mean age of the patients was 60 +/- 9 years, and mean ejection fraction was 36% +/- 9%. The incidence of heart failure in the single population study providing this information was 199 cases per 100 000 person-years. The prevalence of heart failure was 1% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.1%-2.7%); hospital readmission rates were 33%, 28%, 31%, and 35% at 3, 6, 12, and 24 to 60 months of follow-up, respectively; and the median duration of hospitalization was 7.0 days. The 1-year mortality rate was 24.5% (95% CI, 19.4%-30.0%). In-hospital mortality was 11.7% (95% CI, 10.4%-13.0%), and the rate was higher in patients with a reduced ejection fraction, ischemic heart disease, or Chagas disease.
   Conclusions: Few studies have evaluated the incidence and prevalence of heart failure in Latin America. High mortality and hospitalization rates were found, and the main limitation was heterogeneity between studies. The results presented provide useful epidemiologic information for decision-making related to this disease. Further studies with standardized methods and representative populations are needed in this line. (C) 2016 Sociedad Espanola de Cardiologia. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background
   Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) had a dramatic impact on the mortality profile in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals and increased their life-expectancy. Conditions associated with the aging process have been diagnosed more frequently among HIV-infected patients, particularly, cardiovascular diseases.
   Methods
   Patients followed in the Instituto de Pesquisa Clinica Evandro Chagas (IPEC) prospective cohort in Rio de Janeiro were submitted to the general procedures from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health, comprising several anthropometric, laboratory and imaging data. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was measured by ultrasonography, following the Mannheim protocol. Linear regression and proportional odds models were used to compare groups and covariables in respect to cIMT. The best model was chosen with the adaptive lasso procedure.
   Results
   A valid cIMT exam was available for 591 patients. Median cIMT was significantly larger for men than women (0.56mm vs. 0.53mm; p = 0.002; overall = 0.54mm). In univariable linear regression analysis, both traditional risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and HIV-specific characteristics were significantly associated with cIMT values, but the best multivariable model chosen included only traditional characteristics. Hypertension presented the strongest association with higher cIMT terciles (OR = 2.51; 95% CI = 1.69-3.73), followed by current smoking (OR = 1,82; 95% CI = 1.19-2.79), family history of acute myocardial infarction or stroke (OR = 1.60; 95% CI = 1.10-2.32) and age (OR per year = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.10-1.14).
   Conclusions
   Our results show that traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are the major players in determining increased cIMT among HIV infected patients in Brazil. This finding reinforces the need for thorough assessment of those risk factors in these patients to guarantee the incidence of CVD events remain under control.

AB  - Hemoglobin is one of the most important molecules of the human body. Beyond its physiological activity, hemoglobins are able to inhibit the growth of several microorganisms. Since 1999, studies have reported that antimicrobial peptides can be produced by blood-feeding insects through hemoglobin digestion, and it has been reported that Triatoma infestans can generate an antimicrobial fragment from human fibrinopeptide. Thus T. infestans intestinal content was analyzed through Reverse Phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC), the eluted fractions were tested against Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and the active fractions submitted to mass spectrometry. The data obtained were compared to hemoglobin databases to verify the presence of hemoglobin-derived fragments. Ten fractions eluted from chromatography presented antimicrobial activity, and when analyzed through mass spectrometry revealed the presence of 8 murine hemoglobin alpha-chain fragments and 24 fragments from murine hemoglobin beta fragments. Through the compilation of the fragments is possible to obtain over 67% coverage of both sequences. Part of the amino acid sequences corresponds to the sequences already identified on other intestinal contents of arthropods, and are highly conserved between the blood of other wild animals that are the most common intermediate hosts of Chagas' disease in Brazil and some of the main natural blood source for triatomines.

AB  - Background: American cutaneous leishmaniasis is an infectious dermatosis caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania, which comprises a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations depending on the parasite species involved in the infections and the immunogenetic response of the host. The use of techniques for amplification of the parasites DNA based on polymerase chain reaction polymerase chain reaction and the recent application of combined techniques, such as high-resolution DNA dissociation, have been described as a viable alternative for the detection and identification of Leishmania spp. in biological samples.
   Objectives: To identify the Leishmania species using the polymerase chain reaction high-resolution DNA dissociation technique in skin biopsies of hospital-treated patients, and compare with results obtained by other molecular identification techniques.
   Methods: A retrospective study assessing patients with suspected American cutaneous leishmaniasis seen at a hospital in Sao Paulo/Brazil was conducted. The paraffin blocks of 22 patients were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction high-resolution DNA dissociation to confirm the diagnosis and identify the species.
   Results: Of the 22 patients with suspected American cutaneous leishmaniasis, the parasite was identified in 14, comprising five cases (35.6%) of infection by L. amazonensis, four (28.5%) by L. braziliensis, two (14.4%) by L. amazonensis + L. infantum chagasi, two (14.4%) by L. guyanensis, and one (7.1%) by Leishmania infantum chagasi. In one of the samples, in which the presence of amastigotes was confirmed on histopathological examination, the polymerase chain reaction high-resolution DNA dissociation technique failed to detect the DNA of the parasite.

AB  - Introduction Access to public subspecialty healthcare is limited in underserved areas of Brazil, including echocardiography (echo). Long waiting lines and lack of a prioritisation system lead to diagnostic lag and may contribute to poor outcomes. We developed a prioritisation tool for use in primary care, aimed at improving resource utilisation, by predicting those at highest risk of having an abnormal echo, and thus in highest need of referral. Methods All patients in the existing primary care waiting list for echo were invited for participation and underwent a clinical questionnaire, simplified 7-view echo screening by non-physicians with handheld devices, and standard echo by experts. Two derivation models were developed, one including only clinical variables and a second including clinical variables and findings of major heart disease (HD) on echo screening (cut point for high/low-risk). For validation, patients were risk-classified according to the clinical score. High-risk patients and a sample of low-risk underwent standard echo. Intermediate-risk patients first had screening echo, with a standard echo if HD was suspected. Discrimination and calibration of the two models were assessed to predict HD in standard echo. Results In derivation (N = 603), clinical variables associated with HD were female gender, body mass index, Chagas disease, prior cardiac surgery, coronary disease, valve disease, hypertension and heart failure, and this model was well calibrated with C-statistic = 0.781. Performance was improved with the addition of echo screening, with C-statistic = 0.871 after cross-validation. For validation (N = 1526), 227 (14.9%) patients were classified as low risk, 1082 (70.9%) as intermediate risk and 217 (14.2%) as high risk by the clinical model. The final model with two categories had high sensitivity (99%) and negative predictive value (97%) for HD in standard echo. Model performance was good with C-statistic = 0.720. Conclusion The addition of screening echo to clinical variables significantly improves the performance of a score to predict major HD.

AB  - Background: Atrial high-rate episodes (AHREs) are associated with an increased risk of cerebral ischemic events; however, there are no studies related to the presence of AHREs and cerebral ischemic events in Chagasic patients.
   Objective: To investigate the association between the presence of AHREs >= 6 minutes and cerebral ischemic events in Chagasic patients.
   Methods: Cohort study with Chagasic patients with implantable electronic cardiac devices (IECDs), followed at the Arrhythmia Outpatient Clinic of a University Hospital, in the city of Salvador, state of Bahia, Brazil, between May 2016 and June 2017.. Patients diagnosed with atrial flutter / atrial fibrillation, with unicameral IECD and using oral anticoagulation were excluded. AHREs with atrial frequency >= 190 beats per minute and duration >= 6 minutes (min) were considered, and cerebral ischemic events were identified by computed tomography (CT) of the skull.
   Results: The 67 research participants (67.2% females, mean age 63.6 +/- 9.2 years) were followed for 98 +/- 28.8 days and 11.9% of the patients had AHREs >= 6 min. Skull CT showed silent cerebral ischemic events in 16.4% of the patients, 63.6% of whom had AHREs >= 6 min in the analysis of IECDs. Advanced age [OR 1.12 (95% CI 1.03-1.21; p=0.009] and the presence of AHREs >= 6 minutes [OR 96.2 (95% CI 9.4-987.4; p<0.001)] were independent predictors for ischemic events.
   Conclusion: AHREs detected by IECDs were associated with the presence of silent cerebral ischemic events in Chagasic patients.

AB  - Background: The spatial scan statistic is widely used by public health professionals in the detection of spatial clusters in inhomogeneous point process. The most popular version of the spatial scan statistic uses a circular-shaped scanning window. Several other variants, using other parametric or non-parametric shapes, are also available. However, none of them offer information about the uncertainty on the borders of the detected clusters.
   Method: We propose a new method to evaluate uncertainty on the boundaries of spatial clusters identified through the spatial scan statistic for Poisson data. For each spatial data location i, a function F(i) is calculated. While not a probability, this function takes values in the [0, 1] interval, with a higher value indicating more evidence that the location belongs to the true cluster.
   Results: Through a set of simulation studies, we show that the F function provides a way to define, measure and visualize the certainty or uncertainty of each specific location belonging to the true cluster. The method can be applied whether there are one or multiple detected clusters on the map. We illustrate the new method on a data set concerning Chagas disease in Minas Gerais, Brazil.
   Conclusions: The higher the intensity given to an area, the higher the plausibility of that particular area to belong to the true cluster in case it exists. This way, the F function provides information from which the public health practitioner can perform a border analysis of the detected spatial scan statistic clusters. We have implemented and illustrated the border analysis F function in the context of the circular spatial scan statistic for spatially aggregated Poisson data. The definition is clearly independent of both the shape of the scanning window and the probability model under which the data is generated. To make the new method widely available to users, it has been implemented in the freely available SaTScan (TM) software www.satscan.org.

AB  - Human strongyloidiasis is caused by helminth Strongyloides stercoralis. It has a worldwide distribution, often neglected and cause of severe morbidity. The parasitological diagnosis is hindered by the low and irregular amount of larvae in feces. The goal of the present study was to detect IgG and IgG immune complex using conventional serum samples and saliva as alternative samples. We collected samples from 60 individuals, namely: group I composed of 30 healthy individuals; and group II composed of 30 individuals eliminating S. stercoralis larvae in feces. We calculated the area under the curve, general index of diagnostic accuracy, Kappa index and determined the correlations between different diagnostic tests. The detection of IgG levels was performed by an immunoenzymatic assay with alkaline extract of S. venezuelensis larvae as antigen. Positivity of anti-S. stercoralis IgG in serum samples from group I was 3.3%, and from group II 93.3%. The detection of immune complex indicated that group I exhibited 3.3% and group II 56.7%. In the saliva samples, IgG detection was 26.7% for group I and 43.3% for group II. Immune complex was detected in 20% of group I, and 30% of group II. IgG immune complex in conventional serum samples and saliva as alternative samples can be considered biomarkers for the diagnosis of active strongyloidiasis.

AB  - It is widely accepted that the immune system includes molecular and cellular components that play a role in regulating and suppressing the effector immune response in almost any process in which the immune system is involved. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are described as a heterogeneous population of myeloid origin, immature state, with a strong capacity to suppress T cells and other immune populations. Although the initial characterization of these cells was strongly associated with pathological conditions such as cancer and then with chronic and acute infections, extensive evidence supports that MDSCs are also involved in physiological/non-pathological settings, including pregnancy, neonatal period, aging, and vaccination. Vaccination is one of the greatest public health achievements and has reduced mortality and morbidity caused by many pathogens. The primary goal of prophylactic vaccination is to induce protection against a potential pathogen by mimicking, at least in a part, the events that take place during its natural interaction with the host. This strategy allows the immune system to prepare humoral and cellular effector components to cope with the real infection. This approach has been successful in developing vaccines against many pathogens. However, when the infectious agents can evade and subvert the host immune system, inducing cells with regulatory/suppressive capacity, the development of vaccines may not be straightforward. Notably, there is a long list of complex pathogens that can expand MDSCs, for which a vaccine is still not available. Moreover, vaccination against numerous bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi has also been shown to cause MDSC expansion. Increases are not due to a particular adjuvant or immunization route; indeed, numerous adjuvants and immunization routes have been reported to cause an accumulation of this immunosuppressive population. Most of the reports describe that, according to their suppressive nature, MDSCs may limit vaccine efficacy. Taking into account the accumulated evidence supporting the involvement of MDSCs in vaccination, this review aims to compile the studies that highlight the role of MDSCs during the assessment of vaccines against pathogens.

AB  - The parasitic diseases represent the most important health risk, especially in underdeveloped countries where they have a deep impact on public health. Trichomoniasis is a prevalent non-viral sexually transmitted disease, and a significant amount of new cases are identified each year globally. Furthermore, the infection is linked with serious concerns such as pregnancy outcomes, infertility, predisposition to cervical and prostate cancer, and increased transmission and acquisition of HIV. The therapy is restricted, adverse effects are often observed, and resistance to the drugs is emerging. Based on this, a new treatment for trichomoniasis is necessary. Natural products represent a rich source of bioactive compounds, and even today, they are used in the search for new drugs. Additionally, natural products provide a wide variety of leadership structures that can be used by the pharmaceutical industry as a template in the development of new drugs that are more effective and have fewer or no undesirable side effects compared to current treatments.
   This review focuses on the medicinal plants that possess anti-trichomonal activity in vitro or in vivo. An electronic database search was carried out covering the last three decades, i.e., 1990-2020. The literature search revealed that almost a dozen isolated phytoconstituents are being explored globally for their anti-trichomonal activity. Simultaneously, many countries have their own traditional or folk medicine for trichomoniasis that utilizes their native plants, as a whole, or even extracts. This review focuses mainly on the human parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. However, at some points mention is also made to Tritrichomonas foetus that causes trichomoniasis in animals of high veterinary and economical interest. We will focus on the plants and plant-based compounds and their anti-trichomonal activity. The literature search highlighted that there are abundant compounds that possess anti-trichomonal activity; however, in-depth in-vivo evaluation of compounds and their clinical evaluation has not been undertaken. There is a critical need for new anti-trichomonal compounds, and focused research on phytoconstituents can provide the way forward.

AB  - Background: Several tests are performed to obtain better accuracy when diagnosing American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL). It is believed that antigens released via secretion, excretion and metabolism are more specific than are antigens released by the lysis of Leishmania parasites. Such antigens are known as exo-antigens (exo-Ag) and are formed from products released by cultured parasites in a way that is similar to that in which they cause infections in hosts.
   Objective: We attempted to validate a Leishmania mexicana ELISA exo-Ag for ATL diagnosis in Midwestern Brazil.
   Methods: A total of 281 patients were included in the study. We analysed pre-treatment blood from 98 ATL patients; out of those, 85.7% and 14.3% had cutaneous and mucosal forms, respectively.
   Results: The exo-Ag accuracy was 83.99% (95% CI = 79.2487.81) with a sensitivity value of 90.82% (95% CI = 83.4695.09) and an overall specificity value of 80.33% (95% CI = 73.9785.44). The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 71.20% (95% CI = 62.7278.41) and 94.23% (95% CI = 89.4096.94), respectively. Among healthy controls, exo-Ag had a specificity of 91.25% (95% CI = 83.0295.70); additionally, the test had specificity rates of 66.67% (95% CI = 46.7182.03) in Chagas disease patients, 60.61% (95% CI = 43.6875.32) in patients with rheumatic diseases, 76.92% (95% CI = 49.7491.82) in pemphigus foliaceus patients, 87.50% (95% CI = 52.9197.76) in leprosy patients, 87.50% (95% CI = 63.9896.50) in VRDL-positive patients, and 77.78 (95% CI = 45.2693.68) in deep mycosis patients.
   Conclusion: Based on the indicators of validity, we conclude that the results obtained in this study enable the recommendation of the exo-Ag ELISA for ATL diagnosis once it presented a reasonable accuracy compared to classical methods. Cost evaluations are necessary to completely define the role of this technique in large scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Editora Ltda. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: With successful antiretroviral therapy, non-communicable diseases, including malignancies, are increasingly contributing to morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected persons. The epidemiology of AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs) and non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) in HIV-infected populations in Brazil has not been well described. It is not known if cancer trends in HIV-infected populations in Brazil are similar to those of other countries where antiretroviral therapy is also widely available.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical cohorts at Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas (INI) in Rio de Janeiro and Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic (VCCC) in Nashville from 1998 to 2010. We used Poisson regression and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) to examine incidence trends. Clinical and demographic predictors of ADCs and NADCs were examined using Cox proportional hazards models.
   Results: This study included 2,925 patients at INI and 3,927 patients at VCCC. There were 57 ADCs at INI (65% Kaposi sarcoma), 47 at VCCC (40% Kaposi sarcoma), 45 NADCs at INI, and 82 at VCCC. From 1998 to 2004, incidence of ADCs remained statistically unchanged at both sites. From 2005 to 2010, ADC incidence decreased in both cohorts (INI incidence rate ratio per year = 0.74, p < 0.01; VCCC = 0.75, p < 0.01). Overall Kaposi sarcoma incidence was greater at INI than VCCC (3.0 vs. 1.2 cases per 1,000 person-years, p < 0.01). Incidence of NADCs remained constant throughout the study period (overall INI incidence 3.6 per 1,000 person-years and VCCC incidence 5.3 per 1,000 person-years). Compared to general populations, overall risk of NADCs was increased at both sites (INI SIR = 1.4 [95% CI 1.1-1.9] and VCCC SIR = 1.3 [ 1.0-1.7]). After non-melanoma skin cancers, the most frequent NADCs were anal cancer at INI (n = 7) and lung cancer at VCCC (n = 11). In multivariate models, risk of ADC was associated with male sex and immunosuppression. Risk of NADC was associated with increased age.
   Conclusions: In both cohorts, ADCs have decreased over time, though incidence of KS was higher at INI than VCCC. Rates of NADCs remained constant over time at both sites.

AB  - Background: Hyperglycemia occurs in tuberculosis (TB), but the long-term impact is unknown. We estimated the prevalence of hyperglycemia and compared the TB treatment outcomes and 1-year mortality rate according to the glycemic status noted during TB treatment.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of adult patients who had TB and HIV coinfection and started receiving TB treatment at the Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas, Brazil, between 2010-2015. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and hyperglycemia were defined according to the American Diabetes Association. After excluding for known DM at baseline, the proportion of participants who developed new-onset DM after TB treatment was assessed. TB outcome was classified as successful or adverse (i.e., treatment failure, abandonment, and death). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by the log-rank test based on the glycemic status of patients. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to assess the association between hyperglycemia and 1-year mortality. Two-sided p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
   Results: We identified 414 euglycemic patients (87.5%), 49 hyperglycemic patients (10.3%), and 10 patients with known DM (2.1%). Diabetic patients were older compared to the euglycemic and hyperglycemic patients (47.9 vs. 37 vs. 39.7 years, respectively, p = 0.001). Diabetic patients frequently had cavitation on chest image compared to hyperglycemic and euglycemic patients (50% vs. 23.4% vs. 15.3%, p = 0.007, respectively). Hyperglycemic patients had more new-onset DM at follow-up compared to euglycemic (22 vs. 1; p < 0001). Hyperglycemia was associated with adverse outcomes (71.4% vs. 24.6%, p < 0.0001) compared to euglycemia. Crude 1-year mortality was significantly higher in patients with hyperglycemia compared with euglycemia (48.9% vs. 7.9%; unadjusted HR: 5.79 (3.74-8.96)). In the adjusted Cox models, hyperglycemia remained a significant factor for increased 1-year mortality (adjusted HR: 3.72 (2.17-6.38)].
   Conclusions: Hyperglycemia frequently occurs in HIV-infected patients who commence TB treatment, and it increases the risks of adverse TB outcomes and 1-year mortality. Glucose testing during TB treatment detects patients at risk of adverse outcomes. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

AB  - Background Most species of Triatominae live exclusively in Latin America. However, one species, Triatoma rubrofasciata, has been recorded in the Americas as well as in various port areas in Africa and Asia. An increasing number of T. rubrofasciata have been reported in southern China in recent years. However, the origin of this invasive insect vector in China remains unknown, therefore, accurate identification and phylogenetic analysis of the bugs are urgently needed. Methods A total of seven triatomine insect specimens were found and collected from Maoming City, Guangdong Province, China (GDMM) and Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, China (FJZZ), respectively. The obtained insect vector specimens were observed under a dissecting microscope for morphological classification and then the genomic DNA was extracted, and the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 28S rRNA as well as cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) genes of the species were amplified and sequenced. Subsequently, molecular phylogenetic analyses based on multiple alignments of the above genes were conducted in order to identify the species and determine the phylogenetic origin approximation accurately. Results The triatomine insects collected from GDMM and FJZZ were identified as Triatoma rubrofasciata using morphological and genetic analyses. All of the Chinese T. rubrofasciata captured in FJZZ, GDMM and other localities in southern China, together with a Vietnamese and Brazilian strain, formed a new, cohesive clade. T. rubrofasciata in GDMM and FJZZ are likely derived from strains found in Vietnam or Brazil. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of the invasive insect T. rubrofasciata, which is likely derived from strains native to Vietnam or Brazil, in both Maoming City, Guangdong Province and Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province of China. A comparison of the DNA sequences of the 16 s rRNA, 28 s rRNA and COI genes confirmed the specific identification of T. rubrofasciata, and its potential origin in China is based on the phylogenetic analyses undertaken in this study. More targeted interventions and improved entomological surveillance are urgently needed to control the spread of this haematophagous insect in China.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to investigate the risk of long-term mortality associated with weight and waist circumference (WC) change among older adults, particularly the overweight and obese ones. Design: Cohort Study. Setting: The Bambui (Brazil) Cohort Study of Aging. Participants: Community-dwelling elderly (n=1138). Measurements: Weight and WC were reassessed three years after baseline. Mortality risk associated with a 5% weight/WC loss and gain was compared to that of weight/WC stability by Cox models adjusted for clinical, behavioral and social known risk factors for death (age, gender, BMI, smoking, diabetes, total cholesterol, hypertension, Chagas disease, major electrocardiographic changes, physical activity, B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, creatinine, education and household income). Results: Female sex was predominant (718; 63.1%). Mean age was 68 (6.7) years. Weight stability (696; 61.1%) was more common than weight loss (251; 22.1%) or gain (191; 16.8%). WC remained stable in 422 (37.3%), decreased in 418 (37.0%) and increased in 291 (25.7%) participants. There were 334 (29.3%) deaths over a median follow-up time of 8.0 (6.4-8.0) years from weight/WC reassessment. Weight loss (HR 1.69; 95% CI 1.30-2.21) and gain (HR 1.37; 95% CI 1.01-1.85) were associated with increased mortality, except in those who were physically active in which weight gain was associated with decreased mortality. Results were similar for participants who were overweight/obese or with abdominal obesity at baseline (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.02-1.97 and HR 2.01; 95% CI 1.29-3.12, for weight loss and gain, respectively). WC change was not significantly associated with mortality. Conclusion: Although weight loss has been recommended for adults with excessive weight regardless of age, weight change might be detrimental in older adults. Rather than weight loss, clinical interventions should target healthy lifestyle behaviors that contribute to weight stability, particularly physical activity in overweight and obese older adults.

AB  - Background Mortality in HIV-infected individuals might differ by sex and mode of HIV acquisition. We aimed to study mortality in HIV-infected women, heterosexual men, and men who have sex with men (MSM) in a cohort from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   Methods In this observational cohort study, we included HIV-infected women, heterosexual men, and MSM (aged >= 18 years) from the Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas database who were enrolled between Jan 1, 2000, and Oct 30, 2011, and who had at least 60 days of follow-up. Causes of deaths, defined with the Coding of Death in HIV protocol, were documented. Cox proportional hazards models accounting for competing risks were used to explore risk factors for AIDS-related and non-AIDS-related deaths.
   Findings We had 10 142 person-years of follow-up from 2224 individuals: 817 (37%) women, 554 (25%) heterosexual men, and 853 (38%) MSM. Of 103 deaths occurred, 64 were AIDS related, 31 were non-AIDS related, and eight were of unknown causes. In unadjusted analyses, compared with women, the hazard of AIDS-related deaths was higher for heterosexual men (hazard ratio [HR] 3 . 52, 95% CI 1 . 30-9 . 08; p=0 . 009) and for MSM (2 . 30, 0 . 89-5 . 94; p=0 . 084). After adjustment for age, CD4 cell counts, last HIV viral load, antiretroviral therapy use, and AIDS-defi ning infection, AIDS-defi ning malignant disease, and hospital admission during follow-up, the excess risk of AIDS-related death decreased for heterosexual men (adjusted HR 1 . 99, 0 . 75-5 . 25; p=0 . 163) but was unchanged for MSM (2 . 24, 0 . 82-6 . 11; p=0 . 114). Non-AIDS-related mortality did not differ by group.
   Interpretation Compared with women, increased risk of AIDS-related death in heterosexual men was partly mitigated by risk factors for AIDS mortality, whereas the excess risk in MSM was unchanged. Further study of reasons for disparity in AIDS-related mortality by mode of transmission is needed.

AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis represents an important public health issue in different parts of the world, requiring that measures be put in place to control the spread of the disease worldwide. The canine leishmaniasis diagnosis is not easy based on clinical signs, since dogs may not develop the infection with recognizable signs. Thus, the laboratorial diagnosis is essential to ascertain the incidence and prevalence of canine leishmaniasis especially in areas with major control efforts. Although, the diagnosis can be performed by the use of different approaches, the molecular methods such as PCR have become an indispensable tool for leishmaniases diagnosis. A TaqMan assay for real-time PCR (Linj31-qPCR) was developed to determine the parasite occurrence in clinical cases of leishmaniasis. The assay targets an L. (L.) infantum hypothetical protein region. The specificity of the assay was verified by using Leishmania World Health Organization reference strains including parasites belonging to subgenus L. (Leishmania), subgenus L. (Viannia), other Leishmania species and Trypanosoma cruzi. The sensitivity was verified by using isolates of L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (L.) infantum. The usefulness of the assay for diagnosis was ascertained by testing 277 samples from dogs in regions endemic for visceral and/or cutaneous leishmaniasis and from regions in which leishmaniasis was not endemic in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) was determined on these animals by conventional PCR and three serological tests. The dog samples were divided into four groups. I, dogs with CVL (n = 101); II, dogs with other diseases and without CVL (n = 97); III, dogs with American cutaneous leishmaniasis (n = 7), and, IV, dogs without CVL (n = 72) from areas where leishmaniasis was not endemic as control group. Results indicated that Linj31-qPCR was able to identify parasites belonging to subgenus L. (Leishmania) with no cross-amplification with other parasite subgenera. The Linj31-qPCR detected Leishmania parasites DNA in 98% of samples from Group I. In conclusion this methodology can be used as routine diagnostic tools to detect parasites from subgenus Leishmania.

AB  - Background The epidemiology of congenital infections is ever changing, with a recent resurgence in syphilis infection rates seen in the UK. Identification of congenital infection is often delayed; early recognition and management of congenital infections is important. Testing modalities and investigations are often limited, leading to missed diagnostic opportunities.
   Methods The SCORTCH (syphilis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), 'other', rubella, toxoplasmosis, chickenpox, herpes simplex virus (HSV) and blood-borne viruses) acronym increases the awareness of clinicians to the increased risk of congenital syphilis, while considering other infectious aetiologies including: zika, malaria, chagas disease, parvovirus, enterovirus, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and human T-lymphotropic virus 1, in addition to the classic congenital infections recognised in the 'TORCH screen' (toxoplasmosis, 'other', rubella, CMV, HSV). The SCORTCH diagnostic approach describes common signs present in infants with congenital infection, details serological testing for mother and infant and important direct diagnostics of the infant. Direct diagnostic investigations include: radiology, ophthalmology, audiology, microbiological and PCR testing for both the infant and placental tissue, the latter also warrants histopathology.
   Conclusion The traditional 'TORCH screen' focuses on serology-specific investigations, often omits important direct diagnostic testing of the infant, and fails to consider emerging and re-emerging congenital infections. In recognition of syphilis as a re-emerging pathogen and the overlapping clinical presentations of various infectious aetiologies, we advocate for a broader outlook using the SCORTCH diagnostic approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND Rifamycins are a group of antibiotics mainly used in the treatment of tuberculosis (TB), however they interact with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Rifabutin allows more regimens options for concomitant imunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment compared to rifampicin.
   OBJECTIVE Compare the outcomes of TB-HIV co-infected patients who used rifampicin or rifabutin.
   METHODS We analysed data from a prospective cohort study at National Institute of Infectious Diseases Evandro Chagas, Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Brazil. Patients who were treated for TB and HIV with rifampicin or rifabutin, from February 2011 to September 2016 were included.
   FINDINGS There were 130 TB-HIV patients, of whom 102 were treated with rifampicin and 28 with rifabutin. All patients in the rifabutin-treated group and 55% of the rifampicin-treated group patients were ART-experienced. Patients treated with rifampicin had similar abandon and cure rates, interruptions in treatment due to adverse reactions, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome and a similar mortality rate as those treated with rifabutin. However, rifampicin-treated patients had higher CD4 counts and more frequently undetectable HIV viral load by the end of treatment (67% versus 18%, p < 0.001) compared to rifabutin-treated patients, even when only ART-experienced patients were evaluated (66,6% versus 36,3%, p = 0.039).
   CONCLUSIONS Patients who used rifabutin had worst immune and virological control. This group had more ART-experienced patients. New and simpler regimens are needed for patients who do not respond to previous antiretroviral therapies.

AB  - Background Global mortality from AIDS-related diseases has been declining since 2005, resulting primarily from the widespread use and early initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy. Despite the significant improvements, high rates of early mortality, usually defined as that occurring within the 1st year of entry to care, have been observed, especially in resource-limited settings. This analysis draws upon data from an observational cohort of people with HIV (PWH) followed at a reference center for HIV/AIDS care and research in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to identify the pattern and factors associated with early mortality. Methods The study population includes PWH aged 18 or older followed at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Evandro Chagas who were enrolled between 2004 and 2015. The primary outcome was early mortality, defined as deaths occurring within 1 year of inclusion in the cohort, considering two follow-up periods: 0 to 90 days (very early mortality) and 91 to 365 days (early mortality). Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify the variables associated with the hazard of very early and early mortality. Results Overall, 3879 participants contributed with 3616.4 person-years of follow-up. Of 220 deaths, 132 happened in the first 90 days and 88 between 91 and 365 days. Very early mortality rate ratios (MRR) show no statistically significant temporal differences between the periods 2004-2006 to 2013-2015. In contrast, for early mortality, a statistically significant decreasing trend was observed: mortality rates in the periods 2004-2006 (MR = 5.5; 95% CI 3.9-7.8) and 2007-2009 (MR = 3.9; 95% CI 2.7-5.7) were approximately four and three-fold higher when compared to 2013-2015 (MR = 1.4; 95% CI 0.7-2.7). Low CD4 count and prior AIDS-defining illness were strongly associated with higher hazard ratios of death, especially when considering very early mortality. Conclusions The present study shows an excess of mortality in the 1st year of follow-up with no changes in the mortality rates within 90 days among PWH from Rio de Janeiro. We note the significant impact of initiating treatment with immunosuppression, as evidenced by the increased risk of death among those with low CD4 cell count and with AIDS-defining illnesses.

AB  - Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a severe disease, caused by the protozoans Leishmania infantum and L. donovani that is widely diagnosed using serological tools. These, however, have limitations in performance that limit their use for the correct identification of the cases. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of flow cytometry with fixed parasites for VL diagnosis, comparing it with four other serological tests. Samples from two endemic VL regions in Brazil, diagnosed by direct examination (DG1) and by at least two or one standard serological test (DG2 and DG3, respectively), as well as patients with chronic Chagas' disease (CG1) and healthy controls (CG2) were used in this study. The flow cytometry results were expressed as levels of IgG reactivity, based on the percentage of positive fluorescent parasites (PPFP). Using a 1:4096 serum dilution, a ROC curve analysis of the serum titration on flow cytometry has indicated a PPFP of 2% as the cutoff point to segregate positive and negative results. In the present study, flow cytometry had the best performance for DG1 (sensitivity of 96%) while rK39 (imunocromagraphic rapid test) and DAT (Direct agglutination test) were also associated with high sensitivity and specificity. The substantial agreement and kappa indexes observed suggested similar performances between these two tests and flow cytometry. IFAT (Immunofluorescent antibody test) and ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) had lower performances and the lower values of agreement with flow cytometry. Together, these findings suggest that although adjustments are needed in order to reduce cross reactivity with other trypanosomatids, flow cytometry has the potential to be a safe serological alternative for the diagnosis of VL.

AB  - Introduction: Despite years of efforts towards the elimination of Triatoma infestans in Brazil, residual foci still persist in some areas of the States of Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul. The persistence of these T. infestans populations in the country has two different origins of equal concern: operational failures or insecticide resistance. Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize the susceptibility profile of the residual Brazilian populations of T. infestans to deltamethrin. Methods: The susceptibility reference lineage was derived from Cipein/Argentina. The populations studied were manually collected using a dislodging agent in peridomiciles in the States of Bahia (Novo Horizonte) and of Rio Grande do Sul (Santa Rosa and Doutor Mauricio Cardoso). Serial dilutions of deltamethrin were prepared and applied at the dorsal abdomen of first instar nymphs. The control group received only pure acetone. Mortality was evaluated after 72h. Qualitative tests assessed the mortality of a diagnostic dose of 1xLD(99) (2.76ng a.i./nymph) determined for the susceptibility reference lineage. Results: The susceptibility profile characterization of the T. infestans populations revealed an RR50 ranging from 1.73 to 3.26. The mortality percentage in response to a diagnostic dose was 100%. The results obtained in the quantitative and qualitative assays corresponded for all populations. Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that the persistence of residual foci of T. infestans in Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul is not related to insecticide resistance but may be associated with operational failures. In Rio Grande do Sul, we must consider the possibility of continuous reinfestation by Argentinian individuals, which justifies active and efficient epidemiological surveillance.

AB  - Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), caused by Paracoccidioides species, is the main cause of death due to systemic mycoses in Brazil and other Latin American countries. Therapeutic options for PCM and other systemic mycoses are limited and time-consuming, and there are high rates of noncompliance, relapses, toxic side effects, and sequelae. Previous work has shown that the cyclopalladated 7a compound is effective in treating several kinds of cancer and parasitic Chagas disease without significant toxicity in animals. Here we show that cyclopalladated 7a inhibited the in vitro growth of Paracoccidioides lutzii Pb01 and P. brasiliensis isolates Pb18 (highly virulent), Pb2, Pb3, and Pb4 (less virulent) in a dose-response manner. Pb18 was the most resistant. Opportunistic Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans were also sensitive. BALB/c mice showed significantly lighter lung fungal burdens when treated twice a day for 20 days with a low cyclopalladated 7a dose of 30 mu g/ml/day for 30 days after intratracheal infection with Pb18. Electron microscopy images suggested that apoptosis-and autophagy-like mechanisms are involved in the fungal killing mechanism of cyclopalladated 7a. Pb18 yeast cells incubated with the 7a compound showed remarkable chromatin condensation, DNA degradation, superoxide anion production, and increased metacaspase activity suggestive of apoptosis. Autophagy-related killing mechanisms were suggested by increased autophagic vacuole numbers and acidification, as indicated by an increase in Lyso Tracker and monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining in cyclopalladated 7a-treated Pb18 yeast cells. Considering that cyclopalladated 7a is highly tolerated in vivo and affects yeast fungal growth through general apoptosis- and autophagy-like mechanisms, it is a novel promising drug for the treatment of PCM and other mycoses.

   Methods: The characteristics of donors and the serological results of the donated blood were compiled from databases. Only donations with a negative serology or a positive serology confirmed by second-sample testing were included in the study.
   Results: A total of 14,368 donations were included in the study, of which 118 (0.8%) had a confirmed positive serology. Of the total donations, 94.3% were from spontaneous donations and 5.7% from replacement donation. Donations were predominantly from men (54.1%), individuals aged 18 to 29 years (69.1%), and repeat donors (47.7%). Detection rates were higher for HBV (0.63%), followed by syphilis (0.13%), HIV (0.05%), HCV (0.02%), and Chagas disease (0.01%). With the exception of HIV, positive results were more frequent in the older age groups. Positive results for HBV, HCV, and HIV were more frequent among first-time donors. Replacement donations were more likely to have HBV (OR 7.7; 95% CI 4.9-12.1, p<0.0001) and HIV (OR 6.7; 95% CI 1.3-34.7; p = 0.02) than spontaneous donations.
   Conclusion: This study showed that the frequency of infections in blood donations at the HU-UFSC blood bank was lower than the national estimates and that our population may have a greater prevalence of syphilis among older donors (C) 2019 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia Celular.

AB  - Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancy characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria of gestation, with serious consequences for mother and infant. Although a vast amount of research has been performed on the pathogenesis of preeclampsia, the underlying mechanisms of this multisystemic disease have remained to be fully elucidated. Data were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus database GSE40182 dataset. After data preprocessing, differentially expressed genes of placental cells cultured in vitro from preeclampsia and normal pregnancy were determined and subjected to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis to identify the associated pathways. Furthermore, functional principal component analysis (FPCA) was used to calculate the corresponding F-value of each gene. In order to further study the key signaling pathways of preeclampsia, an elastic-net regression model and the Mann-Whitney U (MWU) test were used to estimate the weight of the signaling pathways. Finally, a co-expression network was generated and hub genes were identified based on the topological features. A total of 134 pathways with a role in preeclampsia were identified. The gene expression data of placenta cells cultured in vitro for different durations were determined and F-values of genes were estimated using the FPCA model. The top 1,000 genes were identified as the differentially expressed genes and subjected to further analysis by elastic-net regression and MWU test. Two key signaling pathways were different between the preeclampsia and control groups, namely hsa05142 Chagas disease and hsa05204 Chemical carcinogenesis. Among the genes involved in these two key pathways, 13 hub genes were identified from the co-expression network. Clustering analysis demonstrated that depending on these hub genes, it was possible to divide the sample into four distinct groups based on different incubation time. The top 3 candidates were Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 13 (MAPK13). TLR2 and associated pathways are known to be closely associated with preeclampsia, indirectly demonstrating the applicability of the analytic process applied. However, the role of GSTO1 and MAPK13 in preeclampsia has remained poorly investigated, and elucidation thereof may be a worthwhile endeavor. The present study may provide a basis for exploring potential novel genes and pathways as therapeutic targets for preeclampsia.

AB  - Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) collection began in two Brazilian hospitals for treatment of severe/critical patients. Methods and Materials Mild/moderate COVID-19 convalescents were selected as CCP donors after reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and absence of symptoms for >= 14 days plus (a) age (18-60 years), body weight greater than 55 kg; (b) immunohematological studies; (c) no infectious markers of hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, human T-lymphotropic virus-1/2, Chagas and syphilis infection; (d) no HLA antibodies (multiparous); (e) second RT-PCR (nasopharyngeal swab and/or blood) negativity; (f) virus neutralization test (cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test neutralizing antibody) and anti-nucleocapsid protein SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG, and IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results Among 271 donors (41 females, 230 males), 250 presented with neutralizing antibodies. Final RT-PCR was negative on swab (77.0%) or blood (88.4%;P= .46). Final definition of RT-PCR was only defined at more than 28 days after full recovery in 59 of 174 (33.9%) RT-PCR -ve, and 25/69 RT-PCR +ve (36.2%; 13 between 35 and 48 days). Neutralizing antibody titers of 160 or greater were found in 63.6%. Correlation between IgG signal/cutoff of 5.0 or greater and neutralizing antibody of 160 or greater was 82.4%. Combination of final RT-PCR -ve with neutralizing antibody >= 160 was 41.3% (112/271). Serial plasma collection showed decline in neutralizing antibody titers and IgA levels (P< .05), probably denoting a "golden period" for CCP collection (<= 28 days after joining the program); IgA might have an important role as neutralizing antibody. Donor's weight, days between disease onset and serial plasma collection, and IgG and IgM levels are important predictors for neutralizing antibody titer. Conclusions RT-PCR +ve cases are still detected in 36.2% within 28 to 48 days after recovery. High anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG levels may be used as a surrogate marker to neutralizing antibody.

AB  - The development of an accurate protein-based antigen detection assay for diagnosis of active visceral leishmaniasis (VL) would represent a major clinical advance. VL is a serious and fatal disease caused by the parasites Leishmania infantum and Leishmania donovani. The gold standard confirmatory diagnostic test for VL is the demonstration of parasites or their DNA from aspirates from spleen, lymph node, and bone marrow or from blood buffy coats. Here we describe the production and use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for the development of a sensitive and specific antigen detection capture ELISA for VL diagnosis. This test simultaneously detects six leishmania protein biomarkers that we have previously described (Li-isd1, Li-txn1, Li-ntf2, Ld-mao1, Ld-ppi1 and Ld-mad1). The initial clinical validation of this new mAb-based multiplexed capture ELISA showed a sensitivity of >= 93%. The test was negative with 35 urine samples from healthy control subjects as well as with 30 patients with confirmed non-VL tropical diseases (cutaneous leishmaniasis, n = 6; Chagas disease, n = 6; schistosomiasis, n = 6; and tuberculosis, n = 12). These results strongly support the possible utility of this mAb-based multiplexed capture ELISA as a promising diagnostic test for active VL as well as for monitoring the treatment efficacy of this disease. The test is ready for upscaling and validation for clinical use.
   Author summary
   Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or kala-azar is a systemic parasitic disease that is endemic in 75 countries with more than 500 million people at risk of infection. VL is caused primarily by the parasites known as Leishmania infantum and Leishmania donovani. It is estimated that VL affects 50,000-90,000 people each year, with 90% of the cases occurring in India, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan and Brazil. VL is a fatal disease if not treated. Laboratory diagnosis of this disease can be performed using several different approaches. However, there is still a need for a simple, non-expensive, sensitive and specific test that can be used not only for the accurate diagnosis of this serious disease but also to monitor the efficacy of its treatment. Here we describe a new test that can circumvent most of the drawbacks of existing approaches. This new test detects six leishmanial proteins or biomarkers that are eliminated in the urine of patients with VL. The test is a conventional ELISA assembled with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for each of the six different biomarkers and it is performed in urine samples of suspected patients. An initial clinical validation demonstrated that the test has a sensitivity of >= 93% and specificity of 100%. This new and accurate mAb-based multiplexed assay could be a useful resource to diagnose most clinical forms and/or the severity of the disease e.g., active VL, asymptomatic VL, post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, VL/HIV co-infection, etc.

AB  - The zoonotic transmission of sporotrichosis due to Sporothrix brasiliensis occurs largely in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil since the 1990 ' s. Most patients infected with S. brasiliensis respond well to itraconazole or terbinafine. However, a few patients have a slow response or do not respond to the treatment and develop a chronic infection. The aim of this study was to analyze strains of S. brasiliensis against five different drugs to determine minimal inhibitory concentration distributions, to identify non-wild type strains to any drug evaluated and the clinical aspects of infections caused by them. This study evaluated 100 Sporothrix spp. strains obtained from 1999 to 2018 from the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Fiocruz, which were identified through a polymerase chain reaction using specific primers for species identification. Two-fold serial dilutions of stock solutions of amphotericin B, itraconazole, posaconazole, ketoconazole and terbinafine prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide were performed to obtain working concentrations of antifungal drugs ranging from 0.015 to 8.0 mg/L. The broth microdilution reference method was performed according the M38-A2 CLSI guideline. All strains were identified as S. brasiliensis and thirteen were classified as non-wild type, two of them against different drugs. Non-wild type strains were identified throughout the entire study period. Patients infected by non-wild type strains presented prolonged treatment times, needed increased antifungal doses than those described in the literature and one of them presented a permanent sequel. In addition, three of them, with immunosuppression, died from sporotrichosis. Despite the broad use of antifungal drugs in hyperendemic areas of sporotrichosis, an emergence of non-wild type strains did not occur. The results of in vitro antifungal susceptibility tests should guide sporotrichosis therapy, especially in immunosuppressed patients.

AB  - Author summaryVisceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an infectious disease that is common in most tropical countries. VL has high morbidity and leads to death if not properly treated. In Brazil, Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum is the main causative agent of LV. Golden hamsters have proven to be a suitable model for VL. Despite the importance of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis disturbances in infectious disease, few studies have addressed this issue in VL. In this study, we showed that L. infantum-infected hamsters present augmented levels of plasmatic cortisol in association with increased spleen parasite burden. Indeed, a strong positive correlation was observed between cortisol and biochemical parameters (AST/ALT/ALP) related to liver damage, as well pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1 beta), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-beta), and the arginase enzyme that may favor the progression of infection. On the other side, cortisol was negatively correlated with leucocytes, except monocytes, and with IFN-gamma and iNOS, which are involved in parasite-killing macrophage function. These results shed light on an unexplored aspect of VL pathogenesis, which is the importance of cortisol production in the disease-associated immune dysfunction.
   BackgroundSeveral infectious diseases are associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis disorders by elevating circulating glucocorticoids (GCs), which are known to have an immunosuppressive potential. We conducted this study in golden hamsters, a suitable model human visceral leishmaniasis (VL), to investigate the relationship of Leishmania (L.) infantum infection on cortisol production and VL severity. MethodsL. infantum-infected (n = 42) and uninfected hamsters (n = 30) were followed-up at 30, 120, and 180 days post-infection (dpi). Plasma cortisol was analyzed by radioimmunoassay and cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and arginase by RT-qPCR. ResultsAll hamsters showed splenomegaly at 180 dpi. Increased parasite burden was associated with higher arginase expression and lower iNOS induction. Cortisol levels were elevated in infected animals in all-time points evaluated. Except for monocytes, all other leucocytes showed a strong negative correlation with cortisol, while transaminases were positively correlated. Immunological markers as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta, IL-10, and transforming growth-factor-beta (TGF-beta) were positively correlated to cortisol production, while interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) presented a negative correlation. A network analysis showed cortisol as an important knot linking clinical status and immunological parameters. ConclusionsThese results suggest that L. infantum increases the systemic levels of cortisol, which showed to be associated with hematological, biochemical, and immunological parameters associated to VL severity.

AB  - A single-round multiplex PCR (mPCR) with species-specific primers (SSP) of three mitochondrial genes of Plasmodium, namely COX I, COX III and CYT B, was compared to microscopy and 18S rRNA semi-nested PCR, nested-PCR and Real Time PCRs (*PCRs). Each parasite has between 20 and 150 mitochondria and each mitochondria has one copy of each target gene, while 18S rRNA gene is repeated 4 to 8 times. The specificity of mPCR was assessed by testing Plasmodium from rodents and birds, parasites responsible for other endemic diseases in the country such as schistosomiasis, Chagas disease and leishmaniasis in addition to microorganisms that, like Plasmodium, can cause anemia (Bartonella henselae, Babesia vogeli, Rickettsia vini). No cross-reactions were detected. From a total of 149 specimens from suspected cases of malaria were tested, 97 were positive by microscopy (49 P. falciparum, 38 P. vivax, 6 P. malariae, 4 P. falciparum/P. vivax- mixed infections) and 52 were negative; 148 samples were positive by *PCRs (49 P. falciparum, 53 P. vivax, 7 P. malariae and 39 mixed infections) and one was negative; 146 were positive by mPCR (49 P. falciparum, 56 P. vivax, 9 P. malariae and 32 mixed infections) and three were negative. The comparison of groups found statistically significant differences between microscopy vs.*PCRs or vs. mPCR (p-values <0.0001), but no difference was found between mPCR vs. *PCRs (p=0.946). The agreement in the identification of Plasmodium species was only regular, with Kappa indices of 0.407 (microscopy vs. *PCRs), 0.433 (microscopy vs. mPCR) and 0.558 (*PCRs vs. mPCR). In conclusion, the diagnostic performance of mPCR was comparable to those of *PCRs, and superior to microscopy, although the identification of Plasmodium species showed many disagreements. In conclusion, a sensitive and specific one-round SSP multiplex PCR, capable of simultaneously detecting and identifying P. falciparum, P. vivax/P. simium and P. malariae/P. brasilianum may be useful in resource-constrained countries where quantitative amplifications are not yet fully accessible.

AB  - Dysautonomia covers a range of clinical conditions with different characteristics and prognoses. They are classified as Reflex Syndromes, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (nOH) and Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity Syndrome. Reflex (vasovagal) syndromes will not be discussed in this article.
   1. Reflex (vasovagal) syndromes are mostly benign and usually occur in patients without an intrinsic autonomic nervous system (ANS) or heart disease. Therefore, they are usually studied separately.
   2. Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) is the term most currently used to define dysautonomia with impairment of the sympathetic and/or parasympathetic cardiovascular autonomic nervous system. It can be idiopathic, such as multisystemic atrophy or pure autonomic failure, or secondary to systemic pathologies such as diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease, dementia syndromes, chronic renal failure, amyloidosis and it may also occur in the elderly.
   3. The presence of Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) implies greater severity and worse prognosis in various clinical situations.
   4. Detection of Orthostatic Hypotension (OH) is a late sign and means greater severity in the context of dysautonomia, defined as Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (nOH). It must be differentiated from hypotension due to hypovolemia or medications, called non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nnOH).
   5. OH can result from benign causes, such as acute, chronic hypovolemia or use of various drugs. However, these drugs may only reveal subclinical pictures of Dysautonomia. All drugs of patients with dysautonomic conditions should be reevaluated.
   6. Precise diagnosis of CAN and the investigation of the involvement of other organs or systems is extremely important in the clinical suspicion of pandysautonomia.
   7. In diabetics, in addition to age and time of disease, other factors are associated with a higher incidence of CAN, such poor glycemic control, hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity. Among diabetic patients, 38-44% can develop Dysautonomia, with prognostic implications and higher cardiovascular mortality. In the initial stages of DM, autonomic dysfunction involves the parasympathetic system, then the sympathetic system and, later on, it presents as orthostatic hypotension.
   8. Valsalva, Respiratory and Orthostatic tests (30:15) are the gold standard methods for the diagnosis of CAN. They can be associated with RR Variability tests in the time domain, and mainly in the frequency domain, to increase the sensitivity (protocol of the 7 tests). These tests can detect initial or subclinical abnormalities and assess severity and prognosis.
   9. The Tilt Test should not be the test of choice for investigating CAN at an early stage, as it detects cases at more advanced stages. Tilt response with a dysautonomic pattern (gradual drop in blood pressure without increasing heart rate) may suggest CAN.
   10. Treatment of patients at moderate to advanced stages of dysautonomia is quite complex and often refractory, requiring specialized and multidisciplinary evaluation. There is no cure for most types of Dysautonomia at a late stage.
   11. NOH patients can progress with supine hypertension in more than 50% of the cases, representing a major therapeutic challenge. The immediate risk and consequences of OH should take precedence over the later risks of supine hypertension and values greater than 160/90 mmHg are tolerable. Sleeping with the head elevated (20-30 cm), not getting up at night, taking short-acting antihypertensive drugs for more severe cases, such as losartan, captopril, clonidine or nitrate patches, may be necessary and effective in some cases.
   12. Preventive measures such as postural care; good hydration; higher salt intake; use of compression stockings and abdominal straps; portioned meals; supervised physical activity, mainly sitting, lying down or exercising in the water are important treatment steps.
   13. Various drugs can be used for symptomatic nOH, especially fludrocortisone, midodrine and droxidopa, the latter not available in Brazil. The risk of exacerbation or triggering supine hypertension should be considered.
   14. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome represents a form of Dysautonomia and has been renamed as a systemic disease of exercise intolerance, with new diagnostic criteria: 1 - Unexplained fatigue, leading to occupational disability for more than 6 months; 2 - Feeling ill after exercising; 3 - Non-restorative sleep; 4 - One of the following findings: cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. Several pathologies today have evolved with chronic fatigue, being called chronic diseases associated with chronic fatigue.
   15. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), another form of presentation of dysautonomic syndromes, is characterized by sustained elevation of heart rate (HR) >= 30 bpm (>= 40 bpm if <20 years) or HR >= 120 bpm, in the first 10 minutes in an orthostatic position or during the tilt test, without classical orthostatic hypotension associated. A slight decrease in blood pressure may occur. Symptoms appear or get worse in an orthostatic position, with dizziness, weakness, pre-syncope, palpitations, and other systemic symptoms being common.

AB  - Background: Leishmaniasis is an important parasitic disease affecting millions worldwide. Human cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is endemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where is caused by Leishmania braziliensis. The adaptive immune response is accountable for the healing of CL and despite of key role of CD8(+) T cells in this immune response little is known about the CD8(+) T lymphocytes frequencies, apoptosis and antigen-responsive CD8(+) T lymphocytes of CL patients during antimonial therapy.
   Methods: Using flow cytometry, we examined total and effector CD8(+) T cells from CL patients before (PBT), during (PDT) and after (PAT) treatment for apoptosis and frequencies upon isolation and after in vitro L. braziliensis antigens (LbAg)-stimulation culture. Besides, a correlation study between immunological findings and lesion size was done.
   Results: PDT showed lower frequencies of total CD8(+) T lymphocytes and higher levels of apoptosis of these cells, which were also observed following LbAg-stimulation culture. Regarding effector CD8(+) T cells, high frequencies were observed in PDT, while lower frequencies were observed in PAT. Interestingly, PDT showed higher frequencies of apoptotic-effector CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Similar results were seen after in vitro antigenic-stimulation assays. Correlation analysis showed that the greater the size of lesion, the smaller the frequency of effector CD8(+) T lymphocytes in PDT and PAT, as well as a positive correlation between apoptotic-effector CD8(+) T cells frequency and lesion size of PDT.
   Conclusions: Changes in effector CD8(+) T-lymphocyte frequencies, during and after treatment, seem to represent a critical stage to generate an efficient immune response and suggest that these cells would be evolved in the triggering or in the resolution of lesion, under the influence of therapy. This hypothesis opens new perspectives to clarify controversial statements about the protective or deleterious role of CD8(+) T cells in the cure or aggravation of CL and the new approach of evaluating patients during treatment proved to be of utmost importance for understanding the immune response in the healing process of human CL.

AB  - Background: Sporotrichosis is an endemic zoonosis in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro caused by fungi included in the Sporothrix complex, in which cats are the main source of infection for humans and animals. Coinfections in cats with sporotrichosis from this region, their risk factors and how they affect the treatment outcome in these animals are little known. The objectives of this study were to determine the coinfections of Sporothrix spp. with Toxoplasma gondii, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) and to correlate these infections with risk factors and the outcome of sporotrichosis treatment in cats from an endemic area of sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   Materials, Methods & Results: It was conducted a cohort study involving 213 cats with definitive diagnosis of sporotrichosis from the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro and assisted in the Laboratory of Clinical Research on Dermatozoonosis in Domestic Animals (LAPCLIN-DERMZOO)/Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INI)/Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), in Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil, from November 2007 until February 2011. These animals were monthly evaluated due to sporotrichosis treatment until their sporotrichosis treatment outcomes. In every clinical evaluation, 5 mL of blood were collected in order to obtain the serum, which was stored at -20 degrees C. Information from the animal's medical records have also been collected, such as sex, eating habits, living with other cats, access to the streets, castration, age and the outcome of sporotrichosis treatment. Serological follow-up of anti-T. gondii antibodies were performed through indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) and indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) in all clinical evaluations. The FIV and FeLV antibody detection were made through a rapid immunoassay using the cats'serum samples from the first clinical evaluation. Fisher's exact test was applied to verify associations between T. gondii, FIV and FeLV coinfections, the outcome of sporotrichosis treatment and risk factors. To compare IHA and IFAT, the values of total, positive and negative concordances were evaluated. A P-value < 0.05 indicated significant associations in the statistical tests. Of the 213 cats, fourteen (6.6%) showed antibodies anti-T. gondii, twelve (5.6%) anti-FIV and thirty-five (16.4%) anti-FeLV. There was a concordance of 100% between IFAT and IHA for the serological diagnosis of T. gondii infection. No statistical difference was observed between the presence of anti-T gondii antibodies with the FIV and FeLV infections and with the outcome of sporotrichosis treatment (P > 0.05). Furthermore there was no significant statistical difference between the presence of anti-T gondii antibodies and the variables sex, eating habits, living with other cats, free access to the street, castration and age (P > 0.05). The follow-up of anti-T. gondii antibodies showed that in two cats there was a fourfold rise in the titers between two consecutive follow-ups and in one there was seroconversion, which were indicative of acute infection.
   Discussion: The occurrence of coinfections of sporotrichosis with T. gondii, FIV and FeLV was low in cats from the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where sporotrichosis is endemic. This was the first study that determine and follow-up the frequency of anti-T. gondii antibodies in a group of cats diagnosed with sporotrichosis. The fact that cats were domiciled with adequate feeding and management, the low frequency of T. gondii and the rare cases indicative of acute infection in the study population indicate that these animals are not highly exposed to infection by this protozoan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Confidential unit exclusion (CUE) was introduced in the 1980's as an additional layer to blood safety, before highly specific and sensitive nucleic acid tests (NAT) for HIV were implemented. The utility of CUE-use in settings that have implemented NAT should be evaluated over time.
   STUDY DESIGN, METHODS: Cross-sectional retrospective study carried out from June 2010-November 2015, at Manaus Hemocenter (HEMOAM), Amazonas, Brazil that implemented HIV-NAT in 2012. The HIV, HCV, HBV, HTLV, Chagas disease, and syphilis rates were compared among CUE and non-CUE blood donors, before and after HIV-NAT implementation.
   RESULTS: Among 287,588 donations, 2,154 (0.75%) were associated with CUE, mainly voluntary donations (64.2%), by repeat donors (58.4%) from young (median age = 31 years), males (84.4%), unmarried (63.1%). CUE-users compared to non-CUE donors (n = 285,434) had higher seropositivity rates to HIV (OR = 6.09, 95% CI: 3.68-10.07, p < 0.001), HBV (anti-HBc OR = 1.81 95% CI: 1.24-2.64, p = 0.004; HBsAg OR = 5.68, 95% CI: 1.78-18.07, p = 0.017), and syphilis (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.05-3.04, p = 0.030). Most (97.2%) discarded blood units associated to CUE was seronegative for all pathogens. Most donations (73.4%) were tested by HIV-NAT and showed four window period donations, positive by HIV-NAT only among non-CUE donors.
   CONCLUSION: A high rate of transfusion transmissible infections/TTIs was observed at HEMOAM especially in CUE-users. CUE-use offered an additional layer of blood safety by its association with anti-HBc/HBsAg and syphilis that are not covered by NAT. For blood banks in highly endemic areas for HIV and TTI, as HEMOAM, the identification of at risk donors, and the orientation to be tested at proper sites remain a great challenge.

AB  - Background The white-eared opossum (Didelphis albiventris) is widely distributed throughout Brazil and South America. It has been used as an animal model for studying different scientific questions ranging from the restoration of degraded green areas to medical aspects of Chagas disease, leishmaniasis and resistance against snake venom. As a marsupial, D. albiventris can also contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the different stages of organogenesis. Opossum joeys are born after only 13 days, and the final stages of organogenesis occur when the neonates are inside the pouch, depending on lactation. As neither the genome of this opossum species nor its transcriptome has been completely sequenced, the use of D. albiventris as an animal model is limited. In this work, we sequenced the D. albiventris transcriptome by RNA-seq to obtain the first catalogue of differentially expressed (DE) genes and gene ontology (GO) annotations during the neonatal stages of marsupial development. Results The D. albiventris transcriptome was obtained from whole neonates harvested at birth (P0), at 5 days of age (P5) and at 10 days of age (P10). The de novo assembly of these transcripts generated 85,338 transcripts. Approximately 30% of these transcripts could be mapped against the amino acid sequences of M. domestica, the evolutionarily closest relative of D. albiventris to be sequenced thus far. Among the expressed transcripts, 2077 were found to be DE between P0 and P5, 13,780 between P0 and P10, and 1453 between P5 and P10. The enriched GO terms were mainly related to the immune system, blood tissue development and differentiation, vision, hearing, digestion, the CNS and limb development. Conclusions The elucidation of opossum transcriptomes provides an out-group for better understanding the distinct characteristics associated with the evolution of mammalian species. This study provides the first transcriptome sequences and catalogue of genes for a marsupial species at different neonatal stages, allowing the study of the mechanisms involved in organogenesis.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major cause of morbidity worldwide and a known factor leading to increased risk of death, especially in conjunction with other risk factors. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of DM among HIV-infected patients and its association with overall mortality. All HIV-infected patients 18 years or older who were followed in the Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas (INI) cohort from January 1991 to December 2011 were included. Time-updated covariables included DM status, calendar year, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and CD4 cell counts. Fixed demographic covariables included gender and age at entry. Poisson models were used to calculate mortality rate ratios (RR) with robust variances. Among the 4,871 patients included, 1,192 (24.4%) died (mortality rate=4.72/100 person-years [PY]; 95% confidence interval [CI]=4.46-5.00). Death rates were significantly higher among those presenting with DM compared with those who did not (6.16/100 vs. 4.61/100 PY, respectively. p=0.001). In the final model, DM was significantly associated with mortality (RR=1.74; 95% CI=1.57-1.94; p<0.001). When the analysis was restricted to those on cART or the period post-1996, the association between DM and mortality was even stronger (RR=2.17; 95% CI=1.91-2.46; p<0.001 and RR=1.95; 95% CI=1.75-2.18; p<0.001, respectively). Among the major groups of cause of deaths (CODs), the proportion of AIDS-related conditions in patients with DM was lower (74.27% vs. 58.93%, respectively; p<0.001); whereas in non-AIDS-related conditions, nonimmunodeficiency-related causes (22.44% vs. 34.82%, respectively; p=0.004) were more common in patients with DM. In conclusion, DM was associated with increased mortality rates even after controlling for HIV-related variables associated to this outcome. Differences in the underlying CODs were identified, reinforcing the necessity to assess and treat comorbidities such as DM in HIV-infected patients.

AB  - Background: Sporotrichosis is caused by pathogenic fungi of the genus Sporothrix. The clinically relevant species are S. schenckii, S. globosa and S. brasiliensis. In Brazil, S. brasiliensis is the most prevalent etiological agent among humans and cats. In cats with sporotrichosis, skin lesions are mainly characterized by nodules and ulcers, usually located in the head, nasal region and limbs. The presence of respiratory signs concomitantly with cutaneous lesions is frequent, especially sneezing, and may be associated with lesions located in the nasal mucosa. Ketoconazole (KTZ), itraconazole (112), potassium iodide (KI), sodium iodide (NaI), terbinafine (TRB), fluconazole (FLZ) and amphotericin B (AMB) are the drugs currently available for treating feline sporotrichosis. ITZ remains the drug of choice. ITZ combined with KI has been successfully used in the treatment of naive cats (especially cases with lesions in the nasal region), cases of recurrence and refractory to ITZ. Clinical cure with NaI has been described in some cases, but its use has been limited by adverse reactions. The conventional formulation is the saturated solution and the recommended dose in the treatment of feline sporotrichosis is 10 mg/kg every 12 h. Cats are sensitive to iodide preparations and should be carefully monitored for clinical evidence of iodism, such as apathy, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, hypothermia, hyperthermia, cardiomyopathy, hyperexcitability, muscular spasms and ptyalism. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic response of Na! capsules in feline sporotrichosis.
   Materials, Methods & Results: An observational cohort study was conducted in cats with sporotrichosis at the Laboratory of Clinical Research in Dermatozoonoses in Domestic Animals (Lapclin-Dermzoo), Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INI)/Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Twenty-eight cats with sporotrichosis confirmed by isolation of Sporothrix spp. in culture, no previous systemic antifungal therapy, and weight above 3.0 kg, were included in the study. The treatment consisted of NaI oral capsules (5 mg/kg/once daily). In cats without clinical improvement after one month of treatment, the dose was increased (10 mg/kg/once daily). The cats were followed up monthly by clinical examination, complete blood count and biochemical analysis (urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase - ALT, aspartate aminotransferase - AST, alkaline phosphatase - FA). All procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee (CEUA/Fiocruz), number LW 56/13, and the informed consent term was obtained from all tutors. Clinical cure was achieved in six (21.4%) cases and treatment failure was observed in 13 (46.4%) animals. Seven (25%) cats were lost during follow up, and unknown causes of death occurred in two cases (7.1%). Ten animals (35.7%) presented clinical adverse reactions at some point during treatment. Hyporexia and weight loss were the most frequent ones. Three cats presented alteration in renal function.
   Discussion: Treatment of feline sporotrichosis in epizootic areas has been a challenge for veterinarians and tutors. Additionally, there are few studies evaluating treatment regimens for this mycosis in animals. In this study, NaI was compounded in capsules, because it is easier to administer when compared to the solution, as previously described for KI. Despite the low cost and the convenient administration of the capsule, NaI presented a low cure rate with the dose used. The study of new pharmaceutical forms and lower doses of low-cost drugs is necessary in a scenario of epizootic sporotrichosis, where investments for the development of new antifungal agents arc scarce.

AB  - Canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) has been the theme of several studies given the importance of dog as natural reservoir of the pathogen Leishmania infantum in endemic regions and its role on dissemination of CVL and human visceral Lesihmaniasis (VL). The current immunodiagnosis of CVL has limitations concerning accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. Therefore, improvements are required. rLiNTPDase2 has been previously highlighted as a new recombinant antigen from L. infantum to the CVL diagnosis by ELISA assay (rLiNTPDase2-ELISA). In this study, we aimed to evaluate rLiNTPDase2-ELISA in a Phase II study with 651 dog sera samples, also comparing it with methodologies previously established and used in epidemiology surveillance in Brazil, an endemic country of CVL and VL. The rLiNTPDase2-ELISA using standard control sera showed high capability to distinguish between positive and negative sera, sensitivity of 92.6% and specificity of 88.5%. The test was reproductive and the kappa statistics judgement "substantial agreement". rLiNTPDase2-ELISA does not show cross-reactivity with ehrlichiosis-reagent sera. However, we verified 15.3% of cross-reactivity with Chagas disease-reagent sera. The performance of rLiNTPDase2-ELISA was evaluated using sera samples from vaccinated dogs (Leish-Tec (R)). The results showed high agreement with parasitological and PCR results (sensitivity of 100.0% and specificity of 91.7%). Furthermore, we compared the performance of rLiNTPDase2-ELISA in CVL-reagent sera samples from endemic areas, which were previously diagnosed using other tests for CVL: immunofluorescent (IFI-LVC-Bio-Manguinhos), IFI-LVC-Bio-Manguinhos coupled to ELISA (EIE-LVC-Bio-Manguinhos) and the Rapid Dual Path Platform (R) (TR-DPP (R)-Bio-Manguinhos) coupled to EIE-LVC-Bio-Manguinhos. rLiNTPDase2-ELISA showed high level of concordance with IFI-LVC-Bio-Manguinhos (88.6%) and with IFI-LVC-Bio-Manguinhos coupled to EIE-LVC-Bio-Manguinhos (82.9%) but not with TR-DPP (R)-Bio-Manguinhos coupled to EIE-LVC-Bio-Manguinhos (33.3%), which casts doubts on the effectiveness of this latest test. In addition, the rLiNTPDase2 antigen adsorbed in 96-well plate was stable enough to be used at least for three months. Taken together, our data confirmed, by Phase II study using hundreds samples, the good potential of rLiNTPDase2-ELISA to be used in the field as a new diagnostic assay for CVL.

AB  - What is known and objectiveMalaria is a potentially severe disease, widespread in tropical and subtropical areas. Apart from parasite drug resistance, which receives the largest share of attention, several factors directly influence the response to antimalarial treatment such as incorrect doses, adverse drug events, lack of adherence to treatment, drug quality and drug-drug interactions. Pharmacotherapy follow-up can be used to monitor and improve the effectiveness of treatment, prevent drug-related problems and ensure patient safety. The aim of this study was to describe the results of the implementation of pharmacotherapy follow-up of patients with malaria seen at a reference centre for malaria diagnosis and treatment (CPD-Mal) located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, an area without malaria transmission.
   MethodsA descriptive study was conducted from January 2009 to September 2013 at the Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas (INI) of the FundacAo Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz). All malaria patients enrolled in the study were treated according to the Brazilian Malaria Therapy Guidelines. Data collected during pharmacotherapy follow-up were recorded in a standardized form. The variables included were age, gender, comorbidities, antimalarials and concomitant medications used, adverse drug reactions (ADR), clinical and parasitological cure times, and treatment outcomes classified as success, recurrence (recrudescence or relapse); and lost to follow-up. The ADR were classified by severity (DAIDS-NIH), organ system affected (WHO-ART) and likelihood to be caused by drugs (Naranjo scale).
   Results and discussionOne hundred thirteen cases of malaria were included. Patients were aged between 13 and 66years and the majority of them (75.2%) were male. Ninety-four ADR were observed, most classified as mild (85.1%), related to disorders of the gastrointestinal system (63.8%), such as nausea and vomiting, and assessed as possibly caused by the antimalarial drugs (91.5%). The majority of clinical (90.9%) and parasitological (87.1%) cure occurred less than 72hours after treatment initiation. Pharmacotherapy follow-up of malaria treatment by surveillance activities is therefore important regarding information about treatment outcomes as well as patient safety, resulting in better patient care and reducing the chance of relapses. The results underscore its use as a tool for monitoring adherence and drug resistance outside an endemic area.
   What is new and conclusionPharmacotherapy follow-up should be considered a useful malaria surveillance tool that can be developed by reference centres for comprehensive health care assistance and monitoring of therapeutic resistance.

AB  - Background: Left bundle branch block is recognized as a marker of higher risk of death, but the prognostic value of the right bundle branch block in the general population is still controversial. Our aim is to evaluate the risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality in patients with right (RBBB) and left bundle branch block (LBBB) in a large electronic cohort of Brazilian patients.
   Methods: This observational retrospective study was developed with the database of digital ECGs from Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais, Brazil (TNMG). All ECGs performed from 2010 to 2017 in primary care patients over 16 years old were assessed. The electronic cohort was obtained by linking data from ECG exams (name, sex, date of birth, city of residence) and those from national mortality information system, using standard probabilistic linkage methods (FRIL: Fine-grained record linkage software, v.2.1.5, Atlanta, GA). Only the first ECG of each patient was considered. Clinical data were self-reported, and ECGs were interpreted manually by cardiologists and automatically by the Glasgow University Interpreter software. Hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was estimated using Cox regression.
   Results: From a dataset of 1,773,689 patients, 1,558,421 primary care patients over 16 years old underwent a valid ECG recording during 2010 to 2017. We excluded 17,359 patients that didn't have a valid QRS measure from the Glasgow program and 11,091 patients from the control group that had QRS equal or above 120 ms and were not RBBB or LBBB. Therefore, 1,529,971 were included (median age 52 [Q1:38; Q3:65] years; 40.2% were male). In a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, the overall mortality rate was 3.34%. RBBB was more frequent (2.42%) than LBBB (1.32%). In multivariate analysis, adjusting for sex, age and comorbidities, both patients with RBBB (HR 1.32; CI 95% 1.27-1.37) and LBBB (HR 1.69; CI 95% 1.62-1.76) had higher risk of overall mortality. Women with RBBB had an increased risk of all-cause death compared to men (p < 0.001). Cardiovascular mortality was higher in patients with LBBB (HR 1.77; CI 95% 1.55-2.01), but not for RBBB.
   Conclusions: Patients with RBBB and LBBB had higher risk of overall mortality. Women with RBBB had more risk of all-cause death than men. LBBB was associated with higher risk of cardiovascular mortality. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The syndemics theory seeks to understand the effect of multiple synergic problems in promoting poor health outcomes. To disentangle which and how syndemic conditions affect the quality of life (QoL) may be important to improve well-being of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). This study evaluates the association between syndemic conditions and QoL among PLWHA. We performed a secondary analysis using data obtained between 2014 and 2017 among PLWHA under care in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The outcomes were the six QoL domains (physical, psychological, level of independence, social relationships, environmental, and spirituality) measured through the World Health Organization Quality of Life in HIV infection scale, abbreviated version (WHOQOL-HIV-BREF). The independent variables were demographic and clinical characteristics, syndemic conditions (binge drinking, compulsive sexual behavior, polysubstance use, intimate partner violence, and depression), and syndemics (two or more syndemic conditions simultaneously). Bivariate analysis (t-test and ANOVA) and linear regressions were performed for each quality-of-life domain. The analytical sample comprised 1530 participants, mostly male at birth (64%) and with median age of 43 years. The syndemic conditions most frequently observed were binge drinking (56%), IPV (13%), and depression (9%). Both individual syndemic conditions and syndemics were associated with worse QoL. In the multivariate analysis, positive screening for depression was associated with worse QoL in all domains. Polysubstance users presented worse QoL at social and environmental domains. Intimate partner violence was associated with worse QoL at environment domain while binge drinking was associated with worse scores in the physical domain. The presence of syndemics increased the likelihood of worse scores in the psychological, social, and environment domains. Our study expands the understanding of QoL in PLWHA, as it considers a holistic/integral, multifactorial, and synergistic approach to the determinants of QoL. Seeking strategies that target syndemics may be important to improve patient-centered outcomes in health.
