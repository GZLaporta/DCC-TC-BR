TI  - HTLV infection in Brazil's second-largest indigenous reserve.

AB  - Human T-lymphotropic viruses 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/2) have a worldwide distribution. 
      HTLV-1 has been associated with several diseases, including an aggressive 
      malignant disease known as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and a chronic 
      inflammatory neurological disease called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy, while 
      HTLV-2 has not been definitively associated with diseases. HTLV-2 is most 
      prevalent in specific groups such as injecting drug users and the indigenous 
      population. In Brazil, most studies about HTLV in indigenous are carried out in 
      indigenous communities from the north of the country. Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), 
      Central Brazil, has the second-largest indigenous population in Brazil. However, 
      there is no available data about HTLV infection in this group. We conducted the 
      first investigation of HTLV-1/2 infection prevalence in the indigenous population 
      from Jaguapiru and Bororó villages in Dourados City, MS, to provide the 
      prevalence and molecular characterization of HTLV. For that, a total of 1875 
      indigenous participated in the study. All the serum samples were screened by an 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay commercial kit for the presence of 
      anti-HTLV-1/2 antibodies. Positive samples were confirmed by HTLV-1/2 Western 
      Blot assay. The HTLV-1 5'LTR region was detected by nested PCR amplification and 
      sequenced by Sanger. Most of the study population declared belonging to 
      Guarani-Kaiowá ethnicity (69.18%), 872 (46.51%), and 1003 (53.49%) were from 
      Jaguapiru and Bororó villages, respectively. The median age of participants was 
      31 years, and 74.24% were females. Two individuals were detected with HTLV-1 
      (0.1%; CI 95% 0.1-0.2). The phylogenetic analysis revealed that isolates belong 
      to the Cosmopolitan subtype and the Transcontinental subgroup (HTLV-1aA). The low 
      HTLV-1 prevalence found in this study is similar to that observed among blood 
      donors, and pregnant populations from Mato Grosso do Sul. The absence of HTLV-2 
      infection among these Brazilian indigenous communities would suggest a distinct 
      behavior pattern from other indigenous populations in Brazil.

TI  - Spatiotemporal distribution analysis of syphilis in Brazil: Cases of congenital 
      and syphilis in pregnant women from 2001-2017.
PG  - e0275731

AB  - In Brazil, the notification of congenital (CS) and syphilis in pregnant women 
      (SiP) is compulsory. Notification data provided by the Ministry of Health in 
      combination with the mapping of vulnerable geographic areas is essential to 
      forecasting possible outbreaks and more effectively combating infection through 
      monitoring. We aim to evaluate the spatiotemporal distribution and 
      epidemiological aspects of reported cases of CS and SiP in Brazil. A 
      retrospective ecological study was carried out using secondary surveillance data 
      obtained from the Brazilian National Notifiable Diseases Information System 
      (SINAN) database, considering all reported cases of CS and SiP between 2001 to 
      2017. Epidemiological characteristics and time trends were analyzed using 
      joinpoint regression models and spatial distribution, considering microregions or 
      states/macroregions as units of analysis. A total of 188,630 (359/100,000 birth 
      lives) CS and 235,895 of SiP (6.3/100,000 inhabitants) were reported during the 
      period studied. In general, the epidemiologic profile of Brazil indicates most 
      reported CS cases occurred in "mixed-race" newborns who were diagnosed within 
      seven days of birth and whose mothers had received prenatal care, but the 
      epidemiologic profile varies by Brazilian macroregion. Regarding SiP, most cases 
      were among women who self-reported 'mixed-race', were aged 20-39 years, had up to 
      eight years of formal education and were diagnosed with primary or latent 
      syphilis. Approximately 549 (98.4%) and 558 (100%) microregions reported at least 
      one case of CS and SiP, respectively. From 2012 to 2016, CS cases increased 
      significantly in almost all Brazilian states, most notably in the South, 
      Southeast, and Central-West macroregions, from 2001-2017 and the relative risk 
      (RR) of SiP increased around 400% (RR: 1,00 to 445,50). Considering the 
      epidemiological scenario of the infection in Brazil, it is necessary to enhance 
      preventive, control and eradication measures.

      multicentre retrospective case series.
PG  - 2701-2705
LID - 10.1093/jac/dkac258 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical features and outcomes of infective 
      endocarditis (IE) in pregnant women who do not inject drugs. METHODS: A 
      multinational retrospective study was performed at 14 hospitals. All definite IE 
      episodes between January 2000 and April 2021 were included. The main outcomes 
      were maternal mortality and pregnancy-related complications. RESULTS: Twenty-five 
      episodes of IE were included. Median age at IE diagnosis was 33.2 years (IQR 
      28.3-36.6) and median gestational age was 30 weeks (IQR 16-32). Thirteen (52%) 
      patients had no previously known heart disease. Sixteen (64%) were native IE, 7 
      (28%) prosthetic and 2 (8%) cardiac implantable electronic device IE. The most 
      common aetiologies were streptococci (n = 10, 40%), staphylococci (n = 5, 20%), 
      HACEK group (n = 3, 12%) and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 3, 12%). Twenty (80%) 
      patients presented at least one IE complication; the most common were heart 
      failure (n = 13, 52%) and symptomatic embolism other than stroke (n = 4, 16%). 
      Twenty-one (84%) patients had surgery indication and surgery was performed when 
      indicated in 19 (90%). There was one maternal death and 16 (64%) patients 
      presented pregnancy-related complications (11 patients ≥1 complication): 3 
      pregnancy losses, 9 urgent Caesarean sections, 2 emergency Caesarean sections, 1 
      fetal death, and 11 preterm births. Two patients presented a relapse during a 
      median follow-up of 3.1 years (IQR 0.6-7.4). CONCLUSIONS: Strict medical 
      surveillance of pregnant women with IE is required and must involve a 
      multidisciplinary team including obstetricians and neonatologists. Furthermore, 
      the potential risk of IE during pregnancy should never be underestimated in women 
      with previously known underlying heart disease.

TI  - In Depth Viral Diversity Analysis in Atypical Neurological and Neonatal 
      Chikungunya Infections in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
LID - 10.3390/v14092006 [doi]
LID - 2006
AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) transmitted by 
      Aedes mosquitoes. The human infection usually manifests as a febrile and 
      incapacitating arthritogenic illness, self-limiting and non-lethal. However, 
      since 2013, CHIKV spreading through the tropics and to the Americas was 
      accompanied by an increasing number of cases of atypical disease presentation, 
      namely severe neuropathies and neonatal infection due to intrapartum vertical 
      transmission. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these conditions have 
      not been fully elucidated. However, arbovirus intrahost genetic diversity is 
      thought to be linked to viral pathogenesis. To determine whether particular viral 
      variants could be somehow associated, we analyzed the intrahost genetic diversity 
      of CHIKV in three infected patients with neurological manifestations and three 
      mothers infected during the intrapartum period, as well as their babies following 
      vertical transmission. No statistically supported differences were observed for 
      the genetic variability (nucleotide substitutions/gene length) along the genome 
      between the groups. However, the newborn and cerebrospinal fluid samples 
      (corresponding to virus passed through the placenta and/or the blood-brain 
      barrier (BBB)) presented a different composition of their intrahost mutant 
      ensembles compared to maternal or patient serum samples, even when concurrent. 
      This finding could be consistent with the unidirectional virus transmission 
      through these barriers, and the effect of selective bottlenecks during the 
      transmission event. In addition, a higher proportion of defective variants 
      (insertions/deletions and stop codons) was detected in the CSF and maternal 
      samples and those were mainly distributed within the viral non-structural genes. 
      Since defective viral genomes in RNA viruses are known to contribute to the 
      outcome of acute viral infections and influence disease severity, their role in 
      these atypical cases should be further investigated. Finally, with the in silico 
      approach adopted, we detected no relevant non-conservative mutational pattern 
      that could provide any hint of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these 
      atypical cases. The present analysis represents a unique contribution to our 
      understanding of the transmission events in these cases and generates hypotheses 
      regarding underlying mechanisms, that can be explored further.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus of the 
      Coronaviridae family. Other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were 
      associated with complications in pregnant women. Therefore, this study aimed to 
      report the clinical history of five pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (four 
      symptomatic and one asymptomatic who gave birth to a stillborn child) during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. They gave birth between August 2020 to January 2021, a period 
      in which there was still no vaccination for COVID-19 in Brazil. In addition, 
      their placental alterations were later investigated, focusing on macroscopic, 
      histopathological, and ultrastructural aspects compared to a prepandemic sample. 
      Three of five placentas presented SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCRq at least two 
      to twenty weeks after primary pregnancy infection symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 spike 
      protein was detected in all placentas by immunoperoxidase assay. The macroscopic 
      evaluation of the placentas presented congested vascular trunks, massive 
      deposition of fibrin, areas of infarctions, and calcifications. Histopathological 
      analysis showed fibrin deposition, inflammatory infiltrate, necrosis, and blood 
      vessel thrombosis. Ultrastructural aspects of the infected placentas showed a 
      similar pattern of alterations between the samples, with predominant 
      characteristics of apoptosis and detection of virus-like particles. These 
      findings contribute to a better understanding of the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 
      infection in placental tissue, vertical transmission.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the differences in clinical presentation and relative 
      disease burden of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS)-associated microcephaly at 2 
      large hospitals in Salvador, Brazil that serve patients of different 
      socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS: Clinical and serologic data were collected 
      prospectively from pregnant women and their infants, who delivered at 2 study 
      centers during the 2015-2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Salvador, Brazil. 
      RESULTS: Pregnant women from Salvador, Brazil delivering in a low SES hospital 
      had 3 times higher ZIKV exposure rate than women at a high SES hospital. However, 
      different SES hospitals had similar prevalence of infants with CZS-associated 
      microcephaly (10% vs 6%, p = 0.16) after controlling for ZIKV exposure in their 
      mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the positive association between low 
      SES, high maternal ZIKV exposure, and high rates of CZS-associated microcephaly.

TI  - Gaps in the knowledge of thyroid hormones and placental biology†.
PG  - 1033-1048
LID - 10.1093/biolre/ioac006 [doi]
AB  - Thyroid hormones (THs) are required for the growth and development of the fetus, 
      stimulating anabolism, and oxygen consumption from the early stages of pregnancy 
      to the period of fetal differentiation close to delivery. Maternal changes in the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis are also well known. In contrast, several 
      open questions remain regarding the relationships between the placenta and the 
      maternal and fetal TH systems. The exact mechanism by which the placenta 
      participates in regulating the TH concentration in the fetus and mother and the 
      role of TH in the placenta are still poorly studied. In this review, we aim to 
      summarize the available data in the area and highlight significant gaps in our 
      understanding of the ontogeny and cell-specific localization of TH transporters, 
      TH receptors, and TH metabolic enzymes in the placenta in both human and rodent 
      models. Significant deficiencies also exist in the knowledge of the contribution 
      of genomic and nongenomic effects of TH on the placenta and finally, how the 
      placenta reacts during pregnancy when the mother has thyroid disease. By 
      addressing these key knowledge gaps, improved pregnancy outcomes and management 
      of women with thyroid alterations may be possible.

      HTLV-1/2 serological screening. This tool can contribute to support the 
      implementation of public policies to reduce HTLV-1/2 transmission in Brazil, the 
      country with the highest absolute numbers of HTLV-1/2 infected individuals. The 
      chimeric protein was tested in EIA using serum/plasma of HTLV-infected 
      individuals and non-infected ones from four Brazilian states, including the North 
      and Northeast regions (that present high prevalence of HTLV-1/2) and Southeast 
      region (that presents intermediate prevalence rates) depicting different 
      epidemiological context of HTLV-1/2 infection in our country. We enrolled samples 
      from Pará (n = 114), Maranhão (n = 153), Minas Gerais (n = 225) and São Paulo (n 
      = 59) states; they are from blood donors' candidates (Pará and Minas Gerais), 
      pregnant women (Maranhão) and HIV+/high risk for sexually transmitted infection 
      (STI; São Paulo). Among the HTLV-1/2 positive sera, there were co-infections with 
      viral (HTLV-1 + HTLV-2, HIV, HCV, and HBV), bacterial (Treponema pallidum) and 
      parasitic (Trypanosoma cruzi, Schistosma mansoni, Strongyloides stercoralis, 
      Entamoeba coli, E. histolytica, and Endolimax nana) pathogens related to HTLV-1/2 
      co-morbidities that can contribute to inconclusive diagnostic results. Sera 
      positive for HIV were included among the HTLV-1/2 negative samples. Considering 
      both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2-infected samples from all states and different groups 
      (blood donor candidates, pregnant women, and individuals with high risk for STI), 
      mono or co-infected and HTLV-/HIV+, the test specificity ranged from 90.09 to 
      95.19% and the sensitivity from 82.41 to 92.36% with high accuracy (ROC AUC = 
      0.9552). This multi-epitope protein showed great potential to be used in 
      serological screening of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 in different platforms, even taking 
      into account the great regional variation and different profile of HTLV-1 and 
      HTLV-2 mono or co-infected individuals.

TI  - Litter Size Reduction as a Model of Overfeeding during Lactation and Its 
      Consequences for the Development of Metabolic Diseases in the Offspring.
LID - 10.3390/nu14102045 [doi]
LID - 2045
AB  - Overfeeding during lactation has a deleterious impact on the baby's health 
      throughout life. In humans, early overnutrition has been associated with higher 
      susceptibility to obesity and metabolic disorders in childhood and adulthood. In 
      rodents, using a rodent litter size reduction model (small litter) to mimic early 
      overfeeding, the same metabolic profile has been described. Therefore, the rodent 
      small litter model is an efficient tool to investigate the adaptive mechanisms 
      involved in obesogenesis. Besides central and metabolic dysfunctions, studies 
      have pointed to the contribution of the endocrine system to the small litter 
      phenotype. Hormones, especially leptin, insulin, and adrenal hormones, have been 
      associated with satiety, glucose homeostasis, and adipogenesis, while 
      hypothyroidism impairs energy metabolism, favoring obesity. Behavioral 
      modifications, hepatic metabolism changes, and reproductive dysfunctions have 
      also been reported. In this review, we update these findings, highlighting the 
      interaction of early nutrition and the adaptive features of the endocrine system. 
      We also report the sex-related differences and epigenetic mechanisms. This model 
      highlights the intense plasticity during lactation triggering many adaptive 
      responses, which are the basis of the developmental origins of health and disease 
      (DOHaD) concept. Our review demonstrates the complexity of the adaptive 
      mechanisms involved in the obesity phenotype promoted by early overnutrition, 
      reinforcing the necessity of adequate nutritional habits during lactation.

TI  - Congenital transmission of Mexican strains of Trypanosoma cruzi TcIa: interaction 
      between parasite and human placental explants.
PG  - 418-426
LID - 10.1017/S0031182021002018 [doi]
AB  - Congenital transmission of Chagas disease plays an important role in endemic 
      countries because it is not a diagnosis that is encountered frequently in 
      prenatal care. Due to limited information regarding congenital transmission of 
      Trypanosoma cruzi in Mexico, the present study aimed to investigate protozoan 
      infectivity and modulation of immune responses in human placental explants 
      infected with T. cruzi Ia Mexican strains. The Inc-5 strain showed increased 
      infectivity and modulated IL-1β, IL-10 and TLR-4, decreasing their expression 
      after 24 h of infection. Both strains (Inc-5 and Ninoa) stimulated the production 
      of TNF-α and decreased IL-6 levels 96 h after infection. An important detachment 
      of the syncytiotrophoblast caused by infection with T. cruzi was observed after 
      24 h of infection. In this study, ex vivo infection of human placental villi was 
      performed to better understand interactions involving parasitic T. cruzi and 
      human placental tissue. It was concluded that the strains of TcIa present 
      parasitism in placental tissue, modulation of the innate immune system of the 
      placenta, and cause intense detachment of the syncytiotrophoblast, a fact that 
      may be more associated with abortion and premature birth events than the 
      congenital transmission itself, justifying the low rate of this transmission 
      mechanism by this genotype.

      Brazil].

AB  - HTLV is a retrovirus that affects the human T-lymphocytes. Transmission is 
      bloodborne, sexual, or mother-to-child. Most infected persons are asymptomatic 
      carriers, but some may develop severe cases such as tropical spastic paraparesis, 
      leukemia/lymphoma, and other manifestations. Brazil is considered the country 
      with the highest absolute number of cases, with an estimated 800,000 infected 
      individuals. This article aimed to investigate and analyze the process of 
      inclusion of HTLV on the government agenda in the states of Bahia and Minas 
      Gerais, and which impacted health sector actions and policies. Interviews were 
      held with key actors, and a document search was performed for analysis, using as 
      the main reference the Multiple Streams framework proposed by John Kingdon. 
      Various factors contributed to the theme's inclusion on the health sector agenda 
      in Bahia, the state of Brazil with the widest range of policies on HTLV, 
      involving high prevalence of the infection, a favorable political context, and 
      activism by infected individuals. In Minas Gerais, we observed difficulties in 
      the implementation of this health sector policy; due to the lack of organized 
      advocacy groups, the problem was not a priority in the state's Health 
      Departments. In the current context, individuals with HTLV infection and other 
      stakeholders still have a long road ahead with social mobilization for 
      investments in the area, drafting and implementation of public policies, and 
      guarantee of social rights.

TI  - Brief Report: Vaginal Viral Shedding With Undetectable Plasma HIV Viral Load in 
      Pregnant Women Receiving 2 Different Antiretroviral Regimens: A Randomized 
      Clinical Trial.
PG  - 361-365
LID - 10.1097/QAI.0000000000002771 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women using antiretrovirals (ARVs) may have persistent 
      vaginal viral shedding, which could be associated with sexual and perinatal HIV 
      transmission. However, there are scant data on vaginal viral load (VVL) in 
      pregnant women with undetectable plasma viral load (PVL). METHODS: This study was 
      a post hoc analysis of an open-label randomized trial to evaluate the virologic 
      response of 2 ART regimens. The participants were ART-naive women living with HIV 
      initiating ART regimens between 20 and 36 weeks of pregnancy recruited at 19 
      clinical sites in 6 countries. Participants were randomized to receive 400 mg of 
      raltegravir 2 times a day or 600 mg of efavirenz 4 times a day in addition to 150 
      mg of lamivudine and 300 mg of zidovudine 2 times a day. VVL and PVL tests were 
      performed at every study visit. The primary outcome measures were HIV-1 PVL and 
      VVL at maternal study week 4 and rates of perinatal HIV transmission. RESULTS: A 
      total of 408 were enrolled, of whom 323 had VVL samples 4 weeks after enrollment 
      and were included in this analysis. Among women with undetectable/nonquantifiable 
      PVL during ART, the overall rate of quantifiable VVL at week 4 was 2.54% (7/275). 
      Of the 275 with nonquantifiable PVL, 99.1% (115/116) and 96.2% (153/159) had 
      nonquantifiable VVL in the efavirenz and raltegravir arms, respectively. None of 
      the 7 women with quantifiable VVL at the week 4 study visit transmitted HIV to 
      their infants. CONCLUSIONS: Detectable VVL in pregnant women with 
      undetectable/nonquantifiable PVL while receiving ART was rare and not associated 
      with perinatal HIV transmission.

TI  - Skeletal Muscle Is an Early Site of Zika Virus Replication and Injury, Which 
      Impairs Myogenesis.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection became a worldwide concern due to its correlation 
      with the development of microcephaly and other neurological disorders. ZIKV 
      neurotropism is well characterized, but the role of peripheral viral 
      amplification to brain infection remains unknown. Here, we found that ZIKV 
      replicates in human primary skeletal muscle myoblasts, impairing its 
      differentiation into myotubes but not interfering with the integrity of the 
      already-formed muscle fibers. Using mouse models, we showed ZIKV tropism to 
      muscle tissue either during embryogenesis after maternal transmission or when 
      infection occurred after birth. Interestingly, ZIKV replication in the mouse 
      skeletal muscle started immediately after ZIKV inoculation, preceding viral RNA 
      detection in the brain and causing no disruption to the integrity of the blood 
      brain barrier, and remained active for more than 2 weeks, whereas replication in 
      the spleen and liver were not sustained over time. In addition, ZIKV infection of 
      the skeletal muscle induces necrotic lesions, inflammation, and fiber atrophy. We 
      also found a reduction in the expression of regulatory myogenic factors that are 
      essential for muscle repair after injury. Taken together, our results indicate 
      that the skeletal muscle is an early site of viral amplification and lesion that 
      may result in late consequences in muscle development after ZIKV infection. 
      IMPORTANCE Zika Virus (ZIKV) neurotropism and its deleterious effects on central 
      nervous system have been well characterized. However, investigations of the 
      initial replication sites for the establishment of infection and viral spread to 
      neural tissues remain underexplored. A complete description of the range of 
      ZIKV-induced lesions and others factors that can influence the severity of the 
      disease is necessary to prevent ZIKV's deleterious effects. ZIKV has been shown 
      to access the central nervous system without significantly affecting blood-brain 
      barrier permeability. Here, we demonstrated that skeletal muscle is an earlier 
      site of ZIKV replication, contributing to the increase of peripheral ZIKV load. 
      ZIKV replication in muscle promotes necrotic lesions and inflammation and also 
      impairs myogenesis. Overall, our findings showed that skeletal muscle is involved 
      in pathogenesis and opens new fields in the investigation of the long-term 
      consequences of early infection.

TI  - Environmental Influences Measured by Epigenetic Clock and Vulnerability 
      Components at Birth Impact Clinical ASD Heterogeneity.
LID - 10.3390/genes12091433 [doi]
LID - 1433
AB  - Although Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is recognized as being heavily 
      influenced by genetic factors, the role of epigenetic and environmental factors 
      is still being established. This study aimed to identify ASD vulnerability 
      components based on familial history and intrauterine environmental stress 
      exposure, explore possible vulnerability subgroups, access DNA methylation age 
      acceleration (AA) as a proxy of stress exposure during life, and evaluate the 
      association of ASD vulnerability components and AA to phenotypic severity 
      measures. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to search the vulnerability 
      components from 67 mothers of autistic children. We found that PC1 had a higher 
      correlation with psychosocial stress (maternal stress, maternal education, and 
      social class), and PC2 had a higher correlation with biological factors 
      (psychiatric family history and gestational complications). Comparing the 
      methylome between above and below PC1 average subgroups we found 11,879 
      statistically significant differentially methylated probes (DMPs, p < 0.05). DMPs 
      CpG sites were enriched in variably methylated regions (VMRs), most showing 
      environmental and genetic influences. Hypermethylated probes presented higher 
      rates in different regulatory regions associated with functional SNPs, indicating 
      that the subgroups may have different affected regulatory regions and their 
      liability to disease explained by common variations. Vulnerability components 
      score moderated by epigenetic clock AA was associated with Vineland Total score 
      (p = 0.0036, adjR(2) = 0.31), suggesting risk factors with stress burden can 
      influence ASD phenotype.

TI  - ZIKA Virus Neutralizing Antibody Kinetics in Antenatally Exposed Infants.
PG  - 1060-1068
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiab054 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with severe congenital abnormalities 
      and laboratory diagnosis of antenatal infection is difficult. Here we evaluated 
      ZIKV neutralizing antibody (nAb) kinetics in infants born to mothers with 
      PCR-confirmed ZIKV infection during pregnancy. METHODS: Neonates (n = 98) had 
      serum specimens tested repeatedly for ZIKV nAb over the first 2 years of life 
      using virus neutralization test (VNT). ZIKV neonatal infection was confirmed by 
      RT-PCR in blood or urine and/or presence of ZIKV IgM antibodies, and results were 
      correlated with infant clinical features. RESULTS: Postnatal laboratory evidence 
      of ZIKV vertical transmission was obtained for 60.2% of children, while 32.7% 
      exhibited clinical abnormalities. Congenital abnormalities were found in 37.3% of 
      children with confirmed ZIKV infection and 31.0% of children without confirmed 
      infection (P = .734). All but 1 child displayed a physiologic decline in ZIKV 
      nAb, reflecting maternal antibody decay, despite an early ZIKV-IgM response in 
      one-third of infants. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with antenatal ZIKV exposure do not 
      develop ZIKV nAb despite an early IgM response. Therefore, ZIKV VNT in children 
      is not useful for diagnosis of congenital infection. In light of these findings, 
      it remains to be determined if children infected in utero are potentially 
      susceptible to reinfection.

TI  - Rural residence remains a risk factor for Toxoplasma infection among pregnant 
      women in a highly urbanized Brazilian area: a robust cross-sectional study.
PG  - 896-903
LID - 10.1093/trstmh/traa153 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite high seroprevalence of asymptomatic infection in humans, 
      toxoplasmosis can manifest as a severe systemic disease, as occurs in the 
      congenital infection. Here we evaluate the seroprevalence of Toxoplasma infection 
      among pregnant women in a highly urbanized area of Brazil. METHODS: A robust 
      seroepidemiological study was conducted using laboratory databases of 
      anti-Toxoplasma gondii serological results together with information on age, 
      month/year of diagnosis and place of residence of pregnant women in the public 
      health system of the city of Juiz de Fora, Brazil. RESULTS: Of 5895 pregnant 
      women analysed, 54.7% showed seronegativity and 44.4% showed seropositivity for 
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii. This seropositivity 
      rate increased to 68.3% when only considering participants from rural areas. 
      Multivariate analysis revealed higher odds of being seropositive associated with 
      age (odds ratio [OR] 1.06 [confidence interval {CI} 1.05 to 1.07]) and with 
      living in rural areas (OR 2.96 [CI 1.64 to 5.36]). The spatial distribution of 
      IgG seropositivity indicated a higher prevalence concentrated in rural and 
      peripheral neighbourhoods. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to use spatial 
      analysis to show a cluster of Toxoplasma infection in rural and peripheral 
      neighbourhoods of a highly urbanized municipality, which highlights the need for 
      adequate healthcare actions to be implemented for women living in these areas.

TI  - Altered Umbilical Cord Blood Nutrient Levels, Placental Cell Turnover and 
      Transporter Expression in Human Term Pregnancies Conceived by Intracytoplasmic 
      Sperm Injection (ICSI).
LID - 10.3390/nu13082587 [doi]
LID - 2587
AB  - Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) may increase risk for abnormal placental 
      development, preterm delivery and low birthweight. We investigated placental 
      morphology, transporter expression and paired maternal/umbilical fasting blood 
      nutrient levels in human term pregnancies conceived naturally (n = 10) or by 
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI; n = 11). Maternal and umbilical vein 
      blood from singleton term (>37 weeks) C-section pregnancies were assessed for 
      levels of free amino acids, glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), cholesterol, high 
      density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density 
      lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglycerides. We quantified placental expression of GLUT1 
      (glucose), SNAT2 (amino acids), P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer 
      resistance protein (BCRP) (drug) transporters, and placental morphology and 
      pathology. Following ICSI, placental SNAT2 protein expression was downregulated 
      and umbilical cord blood levels of citrulline were increased, while FFA levels 
      were decreased at term (p < 0.05). Placental proliferation and apoptotic rates 
      were increased in ICSI placentae (p < 0.05). No changes in maternal blood 
      nutrient levels, placental GLUT1, P-gp and BCRP expression, or placental 
      histopathology were observed. In term pregnancies, ICSI impairs placental SNAT2 
      transporter expression and cell turnover, and alters umbilical vein levels of 
      specific nutrients without changing placental morphology. These may represent 
      mechanisms through which ICSI impacts pregnancy outcomes and programs disease 
      risk trajectories in offspring across the life course.

AB  - There are some reports and case series addressing Coronavirus Disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) infections during pregnancy in upper income countries, but there are 
      few data on pregnant women with comorbid conditions in low and middle income 
      Countries. This study evaluated the proportion and the maternal and neonatal 
      outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women with 
      comorbidities. Participants were recruited consecutively in order of admission to 
      a maternity for pregnant women with comorbidities. Sociodemographic, clinical, 
      and laboratory data were prospectively collected during hospitalization. Pregnant 
      women were screened at entry: nasopharyngeal swabs were tested by RT-PCR; serum 
      samples were tested for IgG antibodies against spike protein by ELISA. From April 
      to June 2020, 115 eligible women were included in the study. The proportion of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection was 28.7%. The rate of obesity was 60.9%, vascular 
      hypertension 40.0%, and HIV 21.7%. The most common clinical presentations were 
      ageusia (21.2%), anosmia (18.2%), and fever (18.2%). Prematurity was higher among 
      mothers who had a SARS-CoV-2 infection based on RT-PCR. There were two cases of 
      fetal demise. We found a high proportion of COVID-19 among pregnant women with 
      comorbidities. This underscores the importance of antenatal care during the 
      pandemic to implement universal SARS-CoV-2 screening, precautionary measures, and 
      the rollout of vaccination programs for pregnant women.

AB  - This study describes difficulties in the monitoring of a child born during an 
      oral outbreak of Chagas disease, in which there are several indications that the 
      transmission occurred through the congenital route: 1. the mother was in the 
      third trimester of pregnancy when she was infected; 2. She presented high 
      parasitemia at the time of delivery; 3. In both, the mother and her daughter, T. 
      cruzi was classified as DTU TcIV. The parasites were not found in the blood at 
      birth and the infection was detected only three months later in an asymptomatic 
      infant. As the mother and her child live in a highly endemic area, vector 
      transmission could not be excluded during this period.

PG  - 1476-1488
LID - 10.1007/s43032-020-00434-w [doi]
AB  - The placenta represents a critical node in fetal lipid acquisition, yet the 
      mechanisms by which the placenta handles lipids under normal and pathologic 
      conditions are incompletely understood. A key player in placental lipid handling 
      is peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). PPARγ influences 
      global gene expression via its regulation of the epigenetic modifier lysine 
      methyltransferase 5A (KMT5A), which places a methyl group on histone 4 lysine 20 
      (H4K20me) of target genes. Here we test the hypothesis that KMT5A is present in 
      both the human and rat placentas and is affected by uteroplacental insufficiency 
      (UPI) in the rat in association with increased placental lipid accumulation. We 
      assessed levels and localization of KMT5A, as well as lipid droplet accumulation, 
      in human placental tissue collected from maternal donors after delivery by 
      planned cesarean section. Using a rat model of UPI, we also evaluated the effects 
      of UPI on lipid accumulation, PPARγ, KMT5A, and H4K20me in the rat placenta. In 
      this study, we show for the first time the presence and activity of KMT5A, in 
      human and in rat placentas. We also demonstrate that in the rat placenta, UPI 
      increases hypoxia, KMT5a expression, and activity in association with increased 
      lipid accumulation in placenta supporting male fetuses. Placental PPARγ-KMT5A 
      axis may be an important mediator of placental lipid handling.

      clinical and laboratory characteristics of vertical transmission of CHIKV in the 
      neonate. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a systematic review evaluating the clinical 
      presentation of perinatally-acquired CHIKV infection in neonates. The search was 
      performed using Medline (via PubMed), LILACS, Web of Science, Scielo, Google 
      Scholar and Open grey to identify studies assessing vertical transmission of 
      CHIKV up to November 3, 2020. There were no search restrictions regarding the 
      study type, the publication date or language. Studies with no documented evidence 
      of CHIKV infection in neonates (negative RT-PCR or absence of IgM) were excluded. 
      RESULTS: From the 227 studies initially identified, 42 were selected as follows: 
      28 case reports, 7 case series, 2 cross-sectional studies and 5 cohort studies, 
      for a total of 266 CHIKV infected neonates confirmed by serological and/or 
      molecular tests. The vertical transmission rate was 50% in the Reunion Island 
      outbreak, which was the subject of the majority of the studies; the premature 
      delivery were reported in 19 (45.2%) studies; the rate of fetal distress was 
      19.6% of infected babies and fetal loss occurred in 2% of the cases. 
      Approximately 68.7% of newborns were diagnosed with encephalopathy or 
      encephalitis after perinatally acquired CHIKV. Most of the infected neonates were 
      born healthy, developing CHIKV sepsis clinical syndrome within the first week of 
      life. CONCLUSIONS: We alert neonatologists to the late manifestations of neonatal 
      CHIKV infection, relevant to the management and reduction of morbidity. A 
      limitation of our review was that it was not possible to carry out meta-analysis 
      due to differences in study design and the small number of participants.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of anti-Zika virus IgM, IgAM and IgG ELISAs during 
      co-circulation of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses in Brazil and Venezuela.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serological diagnosis of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is challenging 
      because of the antibody cross-reactivity among flaviviruses. At the same time, 
      the role of Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) is limited by the low proportion of 
      symptomatic infections and the low average viral load. Here, we compared the 
      diagnostic performance of commercially available IgM, IgAM, and IgG ELISAs in 
      sequential samples during the ZIKV and chikungunya (CHIKV) epidemics and 
      co-circulation of dengue virus (DENV) in Brazil and Venezuela. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Acute (day of illness 1-5) and follow-up (day of 
      illness ≥ 6) blood samples were collected from nine hundred and seven symptomatic 
      patients enrolled in a prospective multicenter study between June 2012 and August 
      2016. Acute samples were tested by RT-PCR for ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV. Acute and 
      follow-up samples were tested for IgM, IgAM, and IgG antibodies to ZIKV using 
      commercially available ELISAs. Among follow-up samples with a RT-PCR confirmed 
      ZIKV infection, anti-ZIKV IgAM sensitivity was 93.5% (43/46), while IgM and IgG 
      exhibited sensitivities of 30.3% (10/33) and 72% (18/25), respectively. An 
      additional 24% (26/109) of ZIKV infections were detected via IgAM seroconversion 
      in ZIKV/DENV/CHIKV RT-PCR negative patients. The specificity of anti-ZIKV IgM was 
      estimated at 93% and that of IgAM at 85%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings 
      exemplify the challenges of the assessment of test performance for ZIKV 
      serological tests in the real-world setting, during co-circulation of DENV, ZIKV, 
      and CHIKV. However, we can also demonstrate that the IgAM immunoassay exhibits 
      superior sensitivity to detect ZIKV RT-PCR confirmed infections compared to IgG 
      and IgM immunoassays. The IgAM assay also proves to be promising for detection of 
      anti-ZIKV seroconversions in sequential samples, both in ZIKV PCR-positive as 
      well as PCR-negative patients, making this a candidate assay for serological 
      monitoring of pregnant women in future ZIKV outbreaks.

TI  - Zika virus NS3 protease induces bone morphogenetic protein-dependent brain 
      calcification in human fetuses.
PG  - 455-466
LID - 10.1038/s41564-020-00850-3 [doi]
AB  - The most frequent fetal birth defect associated with prenatal Zika virus (ZIKV) 
      infection is brain calcification, which in turn may potentially affect 
      neurological development in infants. Understanding the mechanism could inform the 
      development of potential therapies against prenatal ZIKV brain calcification. In 
      perivascular cells, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) is an osteogenic factor that 
      undergoes maturation to activate osteogenesis and calcification. Here, we show 
      that ZIKV infection of cultivated primary human brain pericytes triggers BMP2 
      maturation, leading to osteogenic gene expression and calcification. We observed 
      extensive calcification near ZIKV(+) pericytes of fetal human brain specimens and 
      in vertically transmitted ZIKV(+) human signal transducer and activator of 
      transcription 2-knockin mouse pup brains. ZIKV infection of primary pericytes 
      stimulated BMP2 maturation, inducing osteogenic gene expression and calcification 
      that were completely blocked by anti-BMP2/4 neutralizing antibody. Not only did 
      ZIKV NS3 expression alone induce BMP2 maturation, osteogenic gene expression and 
      calcification, but purified NS3 protease also effectively cleaved pro-BMP2 in 
      vitro to generate biologically active mature BMP2. These findings highlight 
      ZIKV-induced calcification where the NS3 protease subverts the BMP2-mediated 
      osteogenic signalling pathway to trigger brain calcification.

TI  - Spontaneous Abortion and Chikungunya Infection: Pathological Findings.
LID - 10.3390/v13040554 [doi]
LID - 554
AB  - Intrauterine transmission of the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) during early pregnancy 
      has rarely been reported, although vertical transmission has been observed in 
      newborns. Here, we report four cases of spontaneous abortion in women who became 
      infected with CHIKV between the 11th and 17th weeks of pregnancy. Laboratorial 
      confirmation of the infection was conducted by RT-PCR on a urine sample for one 
      case, and the other three were by detection of IgM anti-CHIKV antibodies. 
      Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and an electron microscopy assay allowed us 
      to find histopathological, such as inflammatory infiltrate in the decidua and 
      chorionic villi, as well as areas of calcification, edema and the deposition of 
      fibrinoid material, and ultrastructural changes, such as mitochondria with fewer 
      cristae and ruptured membranes, endoplasmic reticulum with dilated cisterns, 
      dispersed chromatin in the nuclei and the presence of an apoptotic body in case 
      1. In addition, by immunohistochemistry (IHC), we found a positivity for the 
      anti-CHIKV antibody in cells of the endometrial glands, decidual cells, 
      syncytiotrophoblasts, cytotrophoblasts, Hofbauer cells and decidual macrophages. 
      Electron microscopy also helped in identifying virus-like particles in the 
      aborted material with a diameter of 40-50 nm, which was consistent with the size 
      of CHIKV particles in the literature. Our findings in this study suggest early 
      maternal fetal transmission, adding more evidence on the role of CHIKV in fetal 
      death.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and it is mainly 
      acquired through the vector route, however, blood transfusion and congenital 
      transmission are implicated in the spread of the illness worldwide. The 
      congenital route can occur at any stage of pregnancy and its frequency varies. In 
      the Federal District, in Brazil, the frequency of T. cruzi infection in pregnant 
      women and their offspring has not been updated. Thus, the aim of this study was 
      to estimate the prevalence of T. cruzi infection in pregnant women and the rate 
      of congenital transmission in the Federal District. A cross-sectional study was 
      conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of T. cruzi from 2014 to 2016 in the 
      population of pregnant women attended by the public health service throughout the 
      Federal District and a descriptive cohort for the evaluation of congenital 
      transmission. During the study, prenatal data of 98,895 women were consulted and 
      pregnant women registered in 2016, presenting with positive T. cruzi serology, 
      were part of the descriptive cohort. The estimated prevalence of T. cruzi 
      infection in the three years was 0.19% and the congenital transmission rate was 
      1/40 (2.5%). Our results have shown that, although the main routes of 
      transmission of CD have been interrupted, there is still a risk of congenital 
      transmission in the Federal District. This present study highlights the need for 
      the continuous implementation of a screening program for pregnant women and 
      timely treatment of infected newborns and children.

TI  - Modeling the cost-effectiveness of maternal acellular pertussis immunization (aP) 
      in different socioeconomic settings: A dynamic transmission model of pertussis in 
      three Brazilian states.
PG  - 125-136
LID - S0264-410X(20)31150-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.09.008 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Using dynamic transmission models we evaluated the health and cost 
      outcomes of adding acellular pertussis (aP) vaccination of pregnant women to 
      infant vaccination in three Brazilian states that represent different 
      socioeconomic conditions. The primary objective was to determine whether the same 
      model structure could be used to represent pertussis disease dynamics in 
      differing socioeconomic conditions. METHODS: We tested three model structures 
      (SIR, SIRS, SIRSIs) to represent population-level transmission in three 
      socio-demographically distinct Brazilian states: São Paulo, Paraná and Bahia. Two 
      strategies were evaluated: infant wP vaccination alone versus maternal aP 
      immunization plus infant wP vaccination. Model projections for 2014-2029 include 
      outpatient and inpatient pertussis cases, pertussis deaths, years of life lost, 
      disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost, and costs (in 2014 USD) of maternal 
      aP vaccination, infant vaccination, and pertussis medical treatment. Incremental 
      cost per DALY averted is presented from the perspective of the Brazilian National 
      Health System. RESULTS: Based on goodness-of-fit statistics, the SIRSIs model fit 
      best, although it had only a modest improvement in statistical quantitative 
      assessments relative to the SIRS model. For all three Brazilian states, maternal 
      aP immunization led to higher costs but also saved infant lives and averted 
      DALYs. The 2014 USD cost/DALY averted was $3068 in Sao Paulo, $2962 in Parana, 
      and $2022 in Bahia. These results were robust in sensitivity analyses with the 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratios exceeding per capita gross regional product 
      only when the probability that a pertussis case is reported was assumed higher 
      than base case implying more overt cases and deaths and therefore more medical 
      costs. CONCLUSIONS: The same model structure fit all three states best, 
      supporting the idea that the disease behaves similarly across different 
      socioeconomic conditions. We also found that immunization of pregnant women with 
      aP is cost-effective in diverse Brazilian states.

TI  - Accurate detection of Zika virus IgG using a novel immune complex binding ELISA.
PG  - 89-101
LID - 10.1111/tmi.13505 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Accurate serological assays are urgently needed to support public 
      health responses to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection with its potential to cause 
      foetal damage during pregnancy. Current flavivirus serology for ZIKV infections 
      lacks specificity due to cross-reacting antibodies from closely related other 
      flaviviruses. In this study, we evaluated novel serological tests for accurate 
      ZIKV IgG detection. METHODS: Our ELISAs are based on immune complex binding. The 
      high specificity is achieved by the simultaneous incubation of labelled ZIKV 
      antigen and unlabelled flavivirus homolog protein competitors. Two assays were 
      validated with a panel of 406 human samples from PCR-confirmed ZIKV patients 
      collected in Brazil (n = 154), healthy blood donors and other infections from 
      Brazil, Europe, Canada and Colombia (n = 252). RESULTS: The highest specificity 
      (100% [252/252, 95% confidence interval (CI) 98.5-100.0]) was shown by the ZIKV 
      ED3 ICB ELISA using the ED3 antigen of the ZIKV envelope. A similar test using 
      the NS1 antigen (ZIKV NS1 ICB ELISA) was slightly less specific (92.1% [232/252, 
      95% CI 88.0-95.1]). The commercial Euroimmun ZIKV ELISA had a specificity of only 
      82.1% (207/252, 95% CI 76.8-86.7). Sensitivity was high (93-100%) from day 12 
      after onset of symptoms in all three tests. Seroprevalence of ZIKV IgG was 
      analysed in 87 samples from Laos (Asia) confirming that the ED3 ELISA showed 
      specific reactions in other populations. CONCLUSIONS: The novel ED3 ICB ELISA 
      will be useful for ZIKV-specific IgG detection for seroepidemiological studies 
      and serological diagnosis for case management in travellers and in countries 
      where other flavivirus infections are co-circulating.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnancy has been associated with 
      microcephaly and severe neurological damage to the fetus. Our aim is to document 
      the risks of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes and the prevalence of 
      laboratory markers of congenital infection in deliveries to women experiencing 
      ZIKV infection during pregnancy, using data from European Commission-funded 
      prospective cohort studies in 20 centres in 11 countries across Latin America and 
      the Caribbean. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will carry out a centre-by-centre 
      analysis of the risks of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, comparing women 
      with confirmed and suspected ZIKV infection in pregnancy to those with no 
      evidence of infection in pregnancy. We will document the proportion of deliveries 
      in which laboratory markers of congenital infection were present. Finally, we 
      will investigate the associations of trimester of maternal infection in 
      pregnancy, presence or absence of maternal symptoms of acute ZIKV infection and 
      previous flavivirus infections with adverse outcomes and with markers of 
      congenital infection. Centre-specific estimates will be pooled using a two-stage 
      approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained at each centre. 
      Findings will be presented at international conferences and published in 
      peer-reviewed open access journals and discussed with local public health 
      officials and representatives of the national Ministries of Health, Pan American 
      Health Organization and WHO involved with ZIKV prevention and control activities.

LID - e0242367
AB  - BACKGROUND: The signs and symptoms of Zika virus infection are usually mild and 
      self-limited. However, the disease has been linked to neurological complications 
      such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and peripheral nerve involvement, and also to 
      abortion and fetal deaths due to vertical transmission, resulting in various 
      congenital malformations in newborns, including microcephaly. This review aimed 
      to describe the o signs and symptoms that characterize the congenital Zika 
      syndrome. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A systematic review was performed with a protocol 
      and described according to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items 
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. The search strategy yielded 
      2,048 studies. After the exclusion of duplicates and application of inclusion 
      criteria, 46 studies were included. The main signs and symptoms associated with 
      the congenital Zika syndrome were microcephaly, parenchymal or cerebellar 
      calcifications, ventriculomegaly, central nervous system hypoplasia or atrophy, 
      arthrogryposis, ocular findings in the posterior and anterior segments, abnormal 
      visual function and low birthweight for gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: Zika virus 
      infection during pregnancy can cause a series of changes in the growth and 
      development of children, while impacting the healthcare system due to the 
      severity of cases. Our findings outline the disease profile in newborns and 
      infants and may contribute to the development and updating of more specific 
      clinical protocols.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Severe consequences of mother-to-child transmission of syphilis and 
      high increasing incidence of congenital syphilis remains an important public 
      health problem in Brazil. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a 
      rapid point-of-care test (RT) and treatment of positive mothers immediately 
      compared with a laboratory-based standard test (ST) with treatment at next 
      follow-up visit. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the 
      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between antenatal syphilis screening 
      strategies. The model was built with lifetime horizon from Brazilian health 
      system perspective using 3% and 5% discount rates. A hypothetical cohort of 
      pregnant women at reproductive age were used in the model. Health outcomes: low 
      birth weight, stillbirths, neonatal deaths and congenital syphilis were estimated 
      in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost. Microcosting study and secondary 
      data provided parameters of direct medical costs. Probabilistic sensitivity 
      analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: For base case, the mean cost per pregnant woman 
      screened was $2.63 (RT) and $2.48 (ST), respectively. Maternal syphilis was 
      associated with a loss of 0.0043 DALYs (RT) and 0.0048 DALYs (ST) per mother 
      screened. Expected value of incremental cost per DALY averted was $298.08. After 
      10 000 probabilistic sensitivity analysis model runs, incremental cost and health 
      benefits were $0.15 (95% credible interval -1.56 to 1.92) and 0.00042 DALYs (95% 
      credible interval -0.0036 to 0.0044), respectively, with a mean ICER of $357.44 
      per DALY. Screening with RT has a 58% chance of being the optimal strategy at a 
      threshold of $3,200 per DALY. CONCLUSIONS: In Brazil, antenatal screening with 
      syphilis RT and immediate treatment is likely to be cost-effective compared with 
      standard screening and must be prioritized in local settings.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is an emerging concern regarding the potential 
      adverse effects during pregnancy. This study reviews knowledge on the impact of 
      COVID-19 on pregnancy and describes the outcome of published cases of pregnant 
      women diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMed®, 
      Scopus®, Web of Science®, and MedRxiv® up to 26th June 2020, using PRISMA 
      standards, to identify original published studies describing pregnant women at 
      any gestational age diagnosed COVID-19. There were no date or language 
      restrictions on the search. All identified studies were included irrespective of 
      assumptions on study quality. Results: We identified 161 original studies 
      reporting 3,985 cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 (1,007 discharged while 
      pregnant). The 2,059 published cases with pregnancy outcomes resulted in 42 
      abortions, 21 stillbirths, and 2,015 live births. Preterm birth occurred in 23% 
      of cases. Around 6% of pregnant women required admission to an intensive care 
      unit and 28 died. There were 10 neonatal deaths. From the 163 cases with amniotic 
      fluid, placenta, and/or cord blood analyzed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 10 were 
      positive. Sixty-one newborns were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Four breast milk 
      samples from 92 cases showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: Emerging 
      evidence suggests that vertical transmission is possible, however, there is still 
      a limited number of reported cases with intrapartum samples. Information, 
      counseling and adequate monitoring are essential to prevent and manage adverse 
      effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.

TI  - Trypanosoma cruzi Presenilin-Like Transmembrane Aspartyl Protease: 
      Characterization and Cellular Localization.
LID - 10.3390/biom10111564 [doi]
LID - 1564
AB  - The increasing detection of infections of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological 
      agent of Chagas disease, in non-endemic regions beyond Latin America has risen to 
      be a major public health issue. With an impact in the millions of people, current 
      treatments rely on antiquated drugs that produce severe side effects and are 
      considered nearly ineffective for the chronic phase. The minimal progress in the 
      development of new drugs highlights the need for advances in basic research on 
      crucial biochemical pathways in T. cruzi to identify new targets. Here, we report 
      on the T. cruzi presenilin-like transmembrane aspartyl enzyme, a protease of the 
      aspartic class in a unique phylogenetic subgroup with T. vivax separate from 
      protozoans. Computational analyses suggest it contains nine transmembrane domains 
      and an active site with the characteristic PALP motif of the A22 family. Multiple 
      linear B-cell epitopes were identified by SPOT-synthesis analysis with Chagasic 
      patient sera. Two were chosen to generate rabbit antisera, whose signal was 
      primarily localized to the flagellar pocket, intracellular vesicles, and 
      endoplasmic reticulum in parasites by whole-cell immunofluorescence. The results 
      suggest that the parasitic presenilin-like enzyme could have a role in the 
      secretory pathway and serve as a target for the generation of new therapeutics 
      specific to the T. cruzi.

AB  - Toxoplasmosis in pregnant women can cause significant morbidity and mortality in 
      the fetus, which may be mitigated by early diagnosis and treatment. Social 
      factors have also been related to the risk of developing the congenital form of 
      toxoplasmosis, since some of these factors interfere directly in the quality of 
      prenatal care. This study aimed to describe the clinical, laboratory, and 
      epidemiological data of pregnant women diagnosed with toxoplasmosis and their 
      newborns followed up at a referral hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This was 
      descriptive cohort study of 334 pregnant women with toxoplasmosis followed from 
      May 2014 to December 2017. We conducted interviews to assess knowledge about the 
      disease and its preventive measures, analyzed clinical and laboratory data during 
      antenatal visits, and collected data from the newborns' medical charts. RESULTS: 
      This was a predominantly low-income women cohort study, with little schooling, 
      mainly referred from public health services late in pregnancy (178; 53.3%), in 
      the second and third trimesters (286; 85.6%). Diagnosis of acute toxoplasmosis 
      had not been confirmed in 171 cases (51.2%). Out of 183 (54.9%) women who had 
      initiated treatment at the original health services, 45 (24.6%) received an 
      incorrect prescription. Seventy-two amniocenteses were performed, with positive 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in the amniotic fluid in two cases 
      (2.8%). Congenital toxoplasmosis at birth was identified in eight newborns 
      (5.4%). CONCLUSION: Late referral to specialized medical services, inadequate 
      toxoplasmosis management at the original prenatal care services, and social 
      vulnerabilities are contributing factors to the persistent occurrence of 
      congenital toxoplasmosis cases.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Screening for genes differentially expressed in placental tissues, 
      aiming to identify transcriptional signatures that may be involved in ZIKV 
      congenital pathogenesis. METHODS: Transcriptome data from placental tissues of 
      pregnant women naturally infected with Zika virus during the third trimester were 
      compared to those from women who tested negative for Zika infection. The findings 
      were validated using both a cell culture model and an 
      immunohistochemistry/morphological analysis of naturally infected placental 
      tissues. RESULTS: Transcriptome analysis revealed that Zika virus infection 
      induces downregulation of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) gene, an essential 
      factor for fetal development. The Caco-2 cell culture model that constitutively 
      expresses IGF2 was used for the transcriptome validation. Asiatic and African 
      Zika virus strains infection caused downregulated IGF2 gene expression in Caco-2 
      cells, whereas other flaviviruses, such as dengue serotype 1, West Nile and 
      wild-type yellow fever viruses, had no effect on this gene expression. 
      Immunohistochemical assays on decidual tissues corroborated our transcriptome 
      analysis, showing that IGF2 is reduced in the decidua of Zika virus-infected 
      women. CONCLUSIONS: Our results draw attention to IGF2 modulation in uterine 
      tissues, and this finding is expected to support future studies on strategies to 
      ameliorate the harmful effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy.

TI  - Short-course Benznidazole treatment to reduce Trypanosoma cruzi parasitic load in 
      women of reproductive age (BETTY): a non-inferiority randomized controlled trial 
      study protocol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Retrospective observational studies suggest that transmission of 
      Trypanosoma cruzi does not occur in treated women when pregnant later in life. 
      The level of parasitemia is a known risk factor for congenital transmission. 
      Benznidazole (BZN) is the drug of choice for preconceptional treatment to reduce 
      parasitic load. The fear of treatment-related side effects limits the 
      implementation of the Argentine guideline recommending BZN 60d/300 mg (or 
      equivalent) treatment of T. cruzi seropositive women during the postpartum period 
      to prevent transmission in a future pregnancy. A short and low dose BZN treatment 
      might reduce major side effects and increase compliance, but its efficacy to 
      reduce T. cruzi parasitic load compared to the standard 60d/300 mg course is not 
      yet established. Clinical trials testing alternative BZN courses among women of 
      reproductive age are urgently needed. METHODS AND DESIGN: We are proposing to 
      perform a double-blinded, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial comparing a 
      short low dose 30-day treatment with BZN 150 mg/day (30d/150 mg) vs. BZN 
      60d/300 mg. We will recruit not previously treated T. cruzi seropositive women 
      with a live birth during the postpartum period in Argentina, randomize them at 6 
      months postpartum, and follow them up with the following specific aims: Specific 
      aim 1: to measure the effect of BZN 30d/150 mg compared to 60d/300 mg 
      preconceptional treatment on parasitic load measured by the frequency of positive 
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) (primary outcome) and by real-time quantitative 
      PCR (qPCR), immediately and 10 months after treatment. Specific aim 2: to measure 
      the frequency of serious adverse events and/or any adverse event leading to 
      treatment interruption. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov . Identifier: 
      NCT03672487 . Registered 14 September 2018.

TI  - Epidemiology of Chagas disease in pregnant women and congenital transmission of 
      Trypanosoma cruzi in the Americas: systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 752-763
LID - 10.1111/tmi.13398 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women and the 
      vertical transmission of the disease. METHODS: Observational studies were 
      identified from eight electronic databases, and details on study design, 
      population and prevalence of Chagas disease were extracted. The data were pooled 
      using a random-effects model, and choropleth maps were created based on 
      geopolitical regions and countries. RESULTS: The search identified 7788 articles, 
      of which 50 were eligible. We observed a 9% prevalence of Chagas disease among 
      pregnant women in the Americas (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8-10, I(2) 
       = 99.96%). High disease prevalence was identified in pregnant women in South 
      American countries (12%, 95% CI: 11-13), while lower values were identified in 
      pregnant women in North America (2%, 95% CI: 1-3). Countries with medium Human 
      Development Index (HDI) had a higher prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant 
      women (15%, 95% CI: 13-16, I(2)  = 99.98%) than countries with high HDI (3%, 95% 
      CI: 2-3). The rate of vertical transmission in the continent was 2% (95% CI: 
      1-2). The statistical analysis showed that this heterogeneity was explained by 
      the study design, region of the Americas and mean income of the country. 
      CONCLUSION: South and Central American countries have a high prevalence and 
      vertical transmission of Chagas disease. Therefore, systematic screens for this 
      disease during the prenatal period are necessary in addition to the diagnosis and 
      treatment of children at risk for Trypanosoma cruzi infection.

TI  - Zika Virus Infects Human Placental Mast Cells and the HMC-1 Cell Line, and 
      Triggers Degranulation, Cytokine Release and Ultrastructural Changes.
LID - 10.3390/cells9040975 [doi]
LID - 975
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emergent arthropod-borne virus whose outbreak in Brazil 
      has brought major public health problems. Infected individuals have different 
      symptoms, including rash and pruritus, which can be relieved by the 
      administration of antiallergics. In the case of pregnant women, ZIKV can cross 
      the placenta and infect the fetus leading to congenital defects. We have 
      identified that mast cells in the placentae of patients who had Zika during 
      pregnancy can be infected. This led to our investigation on the possible role of 
      mast cells during a ZIKV infection, using the HMC-1 cell line. We analyzed their 
      permissiveness to infection, release of mediators and ultrastructural changes. 
      Flow cytometry detection of ZIKV-NS1 expression 24 h post infection in 45.3% of 
      cells showed that HMC-1 cells are permissive to ZIKV infection. Following 
      infection, β-hexosaminidase was measured in the supernatant of the cells with a 
      notable release at 30 min. In addition, an increase in TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10 and 
      VEGF levels were measured at 6 h and 24 h post infection. Lastly, different 
      intracellular changes were observed in an ultrastructural analysis of infected 
      cells. Our findings suggest that mast cells may represent an important source of 
      mediators that can activate other immune cell types during a ZIKV infection, 
      which has the potential to be a major contributor in the spread of the virus in 
      cases of vertical transmission.

AB  - In Fortaleza, the capital of Ceara State, Brazil, the detection rate of 
      tuberculosis (TB) in 2018 was 65.5/100,000 inhabitants with a cure rate of 59.1%, 
      which is higher than the country average. This study investigated the risk 
      factors associated with drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) and identified the 
      drug-resistance phenotype and resistance-conferring mutations. The geographic 
      distribution of DR-TB in Fortaleza, Brazil, was also determined. From March 2017 
      to February 2018, 41 DR-TB isolates and 69 drug-susceptible pulmonary TB isolates 
      were obtained from patients seen at a referral hospital in Fortaleza, Brazil. 
      Samples were subjected to phenotypic and genetic analysis of resistance; the 
      spatial distribution of the participants was also analyzed. Primary resistance 
      was high (50.9%) among participants. The following risk factors for DR were 
      identified: being female ( p = 0.03), having diabetes ( p < 0.01), history of 
      previous TB disease ( p < 0.01), and the number of intra-domiciliary contacts ( p 
      < 0.01). Analysis by multiplex allele-specific polymerase chain reaction detected 
      mutations in the genes katG (65.8%) , rpoB (43.9%), inhA promoter (14.6%), and 
      gyrA (9.8%). Sequencing identified mutations in the the genes katG (75.6%), inhA 
      promoter (19.5%), rpoB (85.4%), and gyrA (100%). There was no mutation in the rrs 
      gene. Spatial analysis showed DR-TB isolates distributed in areas of low 
      socioeconomic status in the city of Fortaleza. Our results emphasized the 
      importance of detecting resistance to TB drugs. The resistance found in the gene 
      gyrA is of concern due to the high number of pre-extensive DR-TB cases in 
      Fortaleza.

AB  - Severe neurological problems and other special manifestations such as high 
      prevalence of structural cardiac changes has been described in infants vertically 
      exposed to the Zika virus (ZIKV) and has been called congenital Zika virus 
      syndrome (CZS). Previous studies have shown that the 24-hour Holter heart rate 
      variability (HRV) analysis allows the prediction of worse outcomes in infants 
      with neurological impairment and higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome 
      (SIDS), hypertension, diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular diseases. This 
      study describes the 24-hour Holter findings of infants with confirmed vertical 
      exposure to the ZIKV by positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays in the 
      mother's blood during pregnancy and/or in the urine or cerebrospinal fluid of the 
      newborn. Data analysis was descriptive and included two subgroups according to 
      the presence of fetal distress, positive PCR to ZIKV in the newborn, CZS and 
      severe microcephaly. Heart rate, pauses, arrhythmias, ST segment and QT interval 
      analyses and HRV evaluation through R-R, SDNN, pNN50 and rMMSD were described. 
      The Mann-Whitney test was performed to assess differences between the two 
      subgroups. The sample consisted of 15 infants with a mean age of 16 months, nine 
      of whom were male. No arrhythmias or QT interval changes were observed. The 
      comparison of HRV through the Mann-Whitney test showed a significant difference 
      between patients with and without CZS, with and without severe microcephaly, with 
      lower HRV in the groups with severe microcephaly and CZS. The study suggests that 
      there is an increased risk of SIDS and cardiovascular diseases in this group of 
      patients.

TI  - New opportunities in tuberculosis prevention: implications for people living with 
      HIV.
PG  - e25438
LID - 10.1002/jia2.25438 [doi]
LID - e25438
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of mortality among people 
      living with HIV (PLHIV). An invigorated global END TB Strategy seeks to increase 
      efforts in scaling up TB preventive therapy (TPT) as a central intervention for 
      HIV programmes in an effort to contribute to a 90% reduction in TB incidence and 
      95% reduction in mortality by 2035. TPT in PLHIV should be part of a 
      comprehensive approach to reduce TB transmission, illness and death that also 
      includes TB active case-finding and prompt, effective and timely initiation of 
      anti-TB therapy among PLHIV. However, the use and implementation of preventive 
      strategies has remained deplorably inadequate and today TB prevention among PLHIV 
      has become an urgent priority globally. DISCUSSION: We present a summary of the 
      current and novel TPT regimens, including current evidence of use with 
      antiretroviral regimens (ART). We review challenges and opportunities to scale-up 
      TB prevention within HIV programmes, including the use of differentiated care 
      approaches and demand creation for effective TB/HIV services delivery. TB 
      preventive vaccines and diagnostics, including optimal algorithms, while 
      important topics, are outside of the focus of this commentary. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      number of new tools and strategies to make TPT a standard of care in HIV 
      programmes have become available. The new TPT regimens are safe and effective and 
      can be used with current ART, with attention being paid to potential drug-drug 
      interactions between rifamycins and some classes of antiretrovirals. More 
      research and development is needed to optimize TPT for small children, pregnant 
      women and drug-resistant TB (DR-TB). Effective programmatic scale-up can be 
      supported through context-adapted demand creation strategies and the inclusion of 
      TPT in client-centred services, such as differentiated service delivery (DSD) 
      models. Robust collaboration between the HIV and TB programmes represents a 
      unique opportunity to ensure that TB, a preventable and curable condition, is no 
      longer the number one cause of death in PLHIV.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy causes congenital abnormalities, 
      including microcephaly. However, rates vary widely, and the contributing risk 
      factors remain unclear. We examined the serum antibody response to ZIKV and other 
      flaviviruses in Brazilian women giving birth during the 2015-2016 outbreak. 
      Infected pregnancies with intermediate or higher ZIKV antibody enhancement titers 
      were at increased risk to give birth to microcephalic infants compared with those 
      with lower titers (P < 0.0001). Similarly, analysis of ZIKV-infected pregnant 
      macaques revealed that fetal brain damage was more frequent in mothers with 
      higher enhancement titers. Thus, features of the maternal antibodies are 
      associated with and may contribute to the genesis of ZIKV-associated 
      microcephaly.

AB  - We report here a probable case of vertical transmission of chikungunya infection 
      with confirmed maternal viremia close to labor that led to severe infection in 
      the newborn. The newborn progressed with cutaneous lesions and irritability 2 
      months after vertical transmission, when chikungunya virus was detected in the 
      infant's CSF by a molecular diagnostic test (real-time polymerase chain 
      reaction).

TI  - Zika virus infection as a cause of congenital brain abnormalities and 
      Guillain-Barré syndrome: A living systematic review.
PG  - 1433
LID - 10.12688/f1000research.19918.1 [doi]
LID - 1433
AB  - Background: The Zika virus (ZIKV) caused a large outbreak in the Americas leading 
      to the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in 
      February 2016. A causal relation between infection and adverse congenital 
      outcomes such as microcephaly was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) 
      informed by a systematic review structured according to a framework of ten 
      dimensions of causality, based on the work of Bradford Hill. Subsequently, the 
      evidence has continued to accumulate, which we incorporate in regular updates of 
      the original work, rendering it a living systematic review. Methods: We present 
      an update of our living systematic review on the causal relation between ZIKV 
      infection and adverse congenital outcomes and between ZIKV and GBS for four 
      dimensions of causality: strength of association, dose-response, specificity, and 
      consistency. We assess the evidence published between January 18, 2017 and July 
      1, 2019. Results: We found that the strength of association between ZIKV 
      infection and adverse outcomes from case-control studies differs according to 
      whether exposure to ZIKV is assessed in the mother (OR 3.8, 95% CI: 1.7-8.7, I 
      (2)=19.8%) or the foetus/infant (OR 37.4, 95% CI: 11.0-127.1, I (2)=0%). In 
      cohort studies, the risk of congenital abnormalities was 3.5 times higher after 
      ZIKV infection (95% CI: 0.9-13.5, I (2)=0%). The strength of association between 
      ZIKV infection and GBS was higher in studies that enrolled controls from hospital 
      (OR: 55.8, 95% CI: 17.2-181.7, I (2)=0%) than in studies that enrolled controls 
      at random from the same community or household (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 0.8-5.4, I 
      (2)=74.6%). In case-control studies, selection of controls from hospitals could 
      have biased results. Conclusions: The conclusions that ZIKV infection causes 
      adverse congenital outcomes and GBS are reinforced with the evidence published 
      between January 18, 2017 and July 1, 2019.

TI  - Dysregulation of placental ABC transporters in a murine model of malaria-induced 
      preterm labor.
PG  - 11488
LID - 10.1038/s41598-019-47865-3 [doi]
LID - 11488
AB  - Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) is characterized by placental accumulation of 
      Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and 
      preterm delivery (PTD). Placental ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters mediate 
      the efflux of nutrients, cytokines and xenobiotics. The expression and activity 
      of these transporters are highly responsive to infection. We hypothesized that 
      MiP would perturb the expression of placental ABC transporters, promoting PTD. 
      Peripheral blood, spleens, livers and placentas of pregnant mice, infected with 
      Plasmodium berghei ANKA on gestational day (GD) 13.5, were collected and analyzed 
      on GD18.5. The primary consequences of human MiP, including IUGR, PTD (20%) and 
      placental inflammation, were recapitulated in our mouse model. Electron 
      microscopy revealed attenuated presence of labyrinthine microvilli and dilated 
      spongiotrophoblasts -granular endoplasmic reticulum cisternae. Additionally, a 
      decrease in placental Abca1 (ABCA1), Abcb1b (P-glycoprotein), Abcb9 and Abcg2 
      (BCRP) expression was observed in MiP mice. In conclusion, MiP associated with 
      PTD impairs placental ABC transporters' expression, potentially modulating

TI  - Understanding the relation between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and 
      adverse fetal, infant and child outcomes: a protocol for a systematic review and 
      individual participant data meta-analysis of longitudinal studies of pregnant 
      women and their infants and children.

LID - e026092
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is a known cause of 
      microcephaly and other congenital and developmental anomalies. In the absence of 
      a ZIKV vaccine or prophylactics, principal investigators (PIs) and international 
      leaders in ZIKV research have formed the ZIKV Individual Participant Data (IPD) 
      Consortium to identify, collect and synthesise IPD from longitudinal studies of 
      pregnant women that measure ZIKV infection during pregnancy and fetal, infant or 
      child outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will identify eligible studies through 
      the ZIKV IPD Consortium membership and a systematic review and invite study PIs 
      to participate in the IPD meta-analysis (IPD-MA). We will use the combined 
      dataset to estimate the relative and absolute risk of congenital Zika syndrome 
      (CZS), including microcephaly and late symptomatic congenital infections; 
      identify and explore sources of heterogeneity in those estimates and develop and 
      validate a risk prediction model to identify the pregnancies at the highest risk 
      of CZS or adverse developmental outcomes. The variable accuracy of diagnostic 
      assays and differences in exposure and outcome definitions means that included 
      studies will have a higher level of systematic variability, a component of 
      measurement error, than an IPD-MA of studies of an established pathogen. We will 
      use expert testimony, existing internal and external diagnostic accuracy 
      validation studies and laboratory external quality assessments to inform the 
      distribution of measurement error in our models. We will apply both Bayesian and 
      frequentist methods to directly account for these and other sources of 
      uncertainty. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The IPD-MA was deemed exempt from ethical 
      review. We will convene a group of patient advocates to evaluate the ethical 
      implications and utility of the risk stratification tool. Findings from these 
      analyses will be shared via national and international conferences and through 
      publication in open access, peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 
      PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews 
      (CRD42017068915).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To contribute to the discussion on the research findings indicating 
      the sexual transmission of American trypanosomiasis and Chagas disease in humans. 
      METHODS: A review of the literature was performed to investigate the routes of 
      transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi parasites and to evaluate the distribution of 
      Chagas disease, which is now found across five continents. RESULTS: The 
      epidemiological profile of American trypanosomiasis, which is still considered a 
      neglected disease of the poor people of Latin America, has changed over time. A 
      family-based study demonstrated that the blood protozoan T. cruzi can be 
      transmitted sexually from infected males and females to naïve mates. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Evidence that Chagas disease can be transmitted sexually, coupled with the 
      migration of individuals with Chagas disease to previously non-endemic countries 
      and increased travel to endemic countries, has implications for public health. 
      Improved screening of blood supplies and prenatal care are required to prevent 
      congenital spread.

TI  - Immune reactivity to Trypanosoma cruzi chimeric proteins for Chagas disease 
      diagnosis in immigrants living in a non-endemic setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic Chagas Disease (CD) diagnosis is based on serological methods 
      employing crude, semipurified or recombinant antigens, which may result in low 
      sensitivity or cross-reactivity. To reduce these restrictions, we developed a 
      strategy involving use of molecules containing repetitive fragments of 
      Trypanosoma cruzi conserved proteins. Diagnostic performance of IBMP-8.1 and 
      IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens (Molecular Biology Institute of Paraná - IBMP in 
      Portuguese acronym) was assessed to diagnose T. cruzi-infected and non-infected 
      immigrants living in Barcelona (Spain), a non-endemic setting for Chagas disease. 
      METHODS: Reactivity of IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 was assessed using an in-house 
      automated ELISA with 347 positive and 331 negative individuals to Chagas disease. 
      Antigenic cross-reactivity was measured with sera samples from pregnant women 
      with Toxoplasma gondii (n = 98) and Zika virus (n = 75) antibodies. RESULTS: The 
      area under the curve values was 1 and 0.99 for the IBMP-8.1 and IBMP-8.4 
      proteins, respectively, demonstrating excellent diagnostic accuracy. The 
      reactivity index was higher for IBMP-8.1 than IBMP-8.4 in positive samples and no 
      significant difference in reactivity index was observed in negative samples. 
      Sensitivity ranged from 99.4% for IBMP-8.1 to 99.1% for IBMP-8.4 and was not 
      statistically different. Specificity for IBMP-8.1 reached 100 and 99.7% for 
      IBMP-8.4, both nearly 100% accurate. No antigenic cross-reactivity was observed 
      and reactivity index was similar to that for negative Chagas disease individuals. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed an outstanding performance of IBMP-8.1 and 
      IBMP-8.4 chimeric antigens by ELISA and suggest both chimeric antigens could also 
      be used for Chagas disease diagnosis in immigrants living in non-endemic 
      settings.

TI  - Association of Infants Exposed to Prenatal Zika Virus Infection With Their 
      Clinical, Neurologic, and Developmental Status Evaluated via the General Movement 
      Assessment Tool.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: There is an urgent need to assess neurodevelopment in Zika virus 
      (ZIKV)-exposed infants. OBJECTIVES: To perform general movement assessment (GMA) 
      at 9 to 20 weeks' postterm age and to evaluate whether the findings are 
      associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 12 months in infants 
      prenatally exposed to acute maternal illness with rash in Brazil during the ZIKV 
      outbreak and in age-matched controls. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this 
      cohort study, infants prenatally exposed to acute maternal illness with rash were 
      recruited at medical institutions in Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, Brazil, 
      from February 1, 2016, to April 30, 2017, while infants without any exposure to 
      maternal illness originated from the Graz University Audiovisual Research 
      Database for the Interdisciplinary Analysis of Neurodevelopment. Participants 
      were 444 infants, including 76 infants without congenital microcephaly, 35 
      infants with microcephaly, and 333 neurotypical children matched for sex, 
      gestational age at birth, and age at GMA. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: General 
      movement assessment performed at 9 to 20 weeks' postterm age, with negative 
      predictive value, positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity 
      generated, as well as clinical, neurologic, and developmental status (Bayley 
      Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition [Bayley-III] scores) at 
      age 12 months. Motor Optimality Scores were generated based on the overall 
      quality of the motor repertoire. Adverse outcomes were defined as a Bayley-III 
      score less than 2 SD in at least 1 domain, a score less than 1 SD in at least 2 
      domains, and/or atypical neurologic findings. RESULTS: A total of 444 infants 
      were enrolled, including 111 children prenatally exposed to a maternal illness 
      with rash and 333 children without any prenatal exposure to maternal illness 
      (57.7% male and mean [SD] age, 14 [2] weeks for both groups); 82.1% (46 of 56) of 
      ZIKV-exposed infants without congenital microcephaly were healthy at age 12 
      months. Forty-four of 46 infants were correctly identified by GMA at 3 months, 
      with a negative predictive value of 94% (95% CI, 85%-97%). Seven of 10 
      ZIKV-exposed children without microcephaly with adverse neurodevelopmental 
      outcomes were identified by GMA. The GMA positive predictive value was 78% (95% 
      CI, 46%-94%), sensitivity was 70% (95% CI, 35%-93%), specificity was 96% (95% CI, 
      85%-99%), and accuracy was 91% (95% CI, 80%-97%). Children with microcephaly had 
      bilateral spastic cerebral palsy; none had normal movements. The Motor Optimality 
      Score differentiated outcomes: the median Motor Optimality Score was 23 
      (interquartile range [IQR], 21-26) in children with normal development, 12 (IQR, 
      8-19) in children with adverse outcomes, and 5 (IQR, 5-6) in children with 
      microcephaly, a significant difference (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      This study suggests that although a large proportion of ZIKV-exposed infants 
      without microcephaly develop normally, many do not. The GMA should be 
      incorporated into routine infant assessments to enable early entry into targeted 
      treatment programs.

TI  - Infectious Morbidity, Mortality and Nutrition in HIV-exposed, Uninfected, 
      Formula-fed Infants: Results From the HPTN 040/PACTG 1043 Trial.
PG  - 1271-1278
LID - 10.1097/INF.0000000000002082 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants are a growing population with 
      potentially poor health outcomes. We evaluated morbidity and mortality in HEU 
      formula-fed infants enrolled in the NICHD HPTN 040/PACTG 1043 trial. METHODS: 
      Infectious morbidity, mortality and undernutrition were evaluated within a cohort 
      of 1000 HEU infants enrolled between April 2004 and April 2010 in Brazil (n = 
      766) and South Africa (n = 234) as part of the NICHD/HPTN 040 trial of 3 
      different antiretroviral regimens to decrease intrapartum HIV vertical 
      transmission. RESULTS: Twenty-three percent of infants had at least 1 infectious 
      serious adverse effect. Infants born to mothers with <12 years of education 
      [adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-5.9), with 
      maternal viral load of >1,000,000 copies/mL at delivery (AOR, 9.9; 95% CI, 
      1.6-63.1) were more likely to have infectious serious adverse effects. At 6 
      months, the infant mortality rate per 1000 live births overall was 22 ± 2.6, 
      9.1 ± 1.8 in Brazil and 64.1 ± 3 in South Africa. Undernutrition and stunting 
      peaked at 1 month of age with 18% having a weight-for-age Z score ≤-2, and 22% 
      with height for Z score ≤-2. The likelihood of infant mortality was greater among 
      infants born in South Africa compared with Brazil (AOR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2.5-15.8), 
      high maternal viral load (AOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.01-2.9) and birth weight-for-age Z 
      score ≤-2 (AOR, 5.2; 95% CI, 1.8-14.8). CONCLUSIONS: There were high rates of 
      undernutrition, stunting and infectious serious adverse effect in this study's 
      formula-fed HEU population. Suppressing maternal HIV viral load during the 
      peripartum period may be a modifiable risk factor to decrease infant mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An intricate fetal-maternal immune crosstalk during pregnancy is 
      essential for a healthy birth. Hence, the infection-induced alterations of 
      maternal immunity often lead to adverse outcomes for mother and/or child. The 
      emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women has been associated 
      with more than 3,000 cases of microcephaly and nervous system malformations. 
      METHODS: To explore the potential correlation of ZIKV-induced alteration of 
      maternal immunity with fetal abnormalities, we performed extensive sera 
      immunoprofiling of 74 pregnant women: 30 symptomatic ZIKV+ pregnant patients and 
      30 healthy pregnant controls in ZIKV-endemic Rio de Janeiro, along with 14 
      healthy pregnant controls in non-endemic Los Angeles. RESULTS: Extensive 
      multiplexing analysis of 69 cytokines revealed that CXCL10, CCL2, and CCL8 
      chemokines were specifically associated with symptomatic ZIKV+ infection during 
      pregnancy, and distinct immunoprofiles were detected at different trimesters in 
      ZIKV-infected pregnant women. Intriguingly, the high CCL2 level and its inverse 
      correlation with CD163, TNFRSF1A, and CCL22 levels was apparently associated with 
      ZIKV-induced abnormal birth. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide insights into the 
      alteration of ZIKV-elicited maternal immunity, serving as a potential clinical 
      biomarker platform. FUNDING: NIH (CA200422, CA180779, DE023926, AI073099,

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of the mother during pregnancy causes devastating 
      Zika congenital syndrome in the offspring. A ZIKV vaccine with optimal safety and 
      immunogenicity for use in pregnant women is critically needed. Toward this goal, 
      we have developed a single-dose live-attenuated vaccine candidate that infects 
      cells with controlled, limited infection rounds. The vaccine contains a 
      9-amino-acid deletion in the viral capsid protein and replicates to titers of > 
      10(6) focus-forming units (FFU)/mL in cells expressing the full-length capsid 
      protein. Immunization of A129 mice with one dose (10(5) FFU) did not produce 
      viremia, but elicited protective immunity that completely prevented viremia, 
      morbidity, and mortality after challenge with an epidemic ZIKV strain (10(6) 
      PFU). A single-dose vaccination also fully prevented infection of pregnant mice 
      and maternal-to-fetal transmission. Intracranial injection of the vaccine (10(4) 
      FFU) to 1-day-old mice did not cause any disease or death, underscoring the 
      safety of this vaccine candidate.

AB  - : media-1vid110.1542/5804915134001PEDS-VA_2018-1104Video Abstract OBJECTIVES: To 
      characterize ophthalmic manifestations of confirmed or suspected antenatal Zika 
      virus (ZIKV) exposure. METHODS: Infants with antenatal ZIKV exposure were 
      referred for evaluation during the 2015-2016 Rio de Janeiro outbreak. Mothers 
      with symptomatic ZIKV infection during pregnancy and/or infants with microcephaly 
      or other findings that were suggestive of suspected antenatal exposure were 
      tested with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Complete 
      eye examinations were performed by pediatric ophthalmologists between January 
      2016 and February 2017. The main outcome measure was eye abnormalities in 
      RT-PCR-positive and suspected (ie, not tested or RT-PCR-negative) antenatal ZIKV 
      cases. RESULTS: Of 224 infants, 189 had RT-PCR testing performed. Of 189 
      patients, 156 had positive RT-PCR results in their blood, urine, and/or placenta. 
      Of 224 infants, 90 had central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities, including 
      microcephaly (62 infants). Eye abnormalities were present in 57 of 224 (25.4%) 
      infants. Optic nerve (44 of 57; 77.2%) and retina abnormalities (37 of 57; 64.9%) 
      were the most common. The group with suspected ZIKV infection (68 infants) had 
      proportionally more eye (36.8% vs 20.5%; P = .022) and CNS abnormalities (68.3% 
      vs 28.1%; P = .008), likely because of referral patterns. Eye abnormalities 
      consistent with ZIKV infection were clinically comparable in both RT-PCR-positive 
      and unconfirmed groups, including 4 RT-PCR-positive infants of 5 without any CNS 
      abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Similar eye manifestations were identified regardless 
      of laboratory confirmation. Well-appearing infants were also found to have eye 
      abnormalities. Therefore, all infants born after ZIKV outbreaks should be 
      universally screened for eye abnormalities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated in Uganda in 1947. In Brazil, 
      the first reported case of ZIKV infection was in May 2015. Additionally, dengue 
      (DENV) is endemic and there has been a recent outbreak of chikungunya (CHIKV). 
      Since the clinical manifestations of different arboviral infections (AI) can be 
      similar, definitive diagnosis requires laboratory testing. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine the prevalence of ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV infections in a Brazilian 
      cohort of HIV-infected pregnant women, to assess clinical/immunological 
      characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of women with evidence of recent AI. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Laboratory diagnosis of ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV infections utilized 
      serological assays, RT-PCR and PRNT. The tests were performed at the first visit, 
      34-36 weeks of gestation and at any time if a woman had symptoms suggestive of 
      AI. Mann-Whitney tests were used for comparison of medians, Chi-square or 
      Fisher's to compare proportions; p< 0.05 was considered statistically 
      significant. Poisson regression was used to analyze risk factors for central 
      nervous system (CNS) malformations in the infant according to maternal 
      symptomatology. RESULTS: Of 219 HIV-infected pregnant women enrolled, 92% were 
      DENV IgG+; 47(22%) had laboratory evidence of recent AI. Of these, 34 (72%) were 
      ZIKV+, nine (19%) CHIKV+, and two (4%) DENV+. Symptoms consistent with AI were 
      observed in 23 (10%) women, of whom 10 (43%) were ZIKV+, eight (35%) CHIKV+. No 
      CNS abnormalities were observed among infants of DENV+ or CHIKV+ women; four 
      infants with CNS abnormalities were born to ZIKV+ women (three symptomatic). 
      Infants born to ZIKV+ women had a higher risk of CNS malformations if the mother 
      was symptomatic (RR = 7.20), albeit not statistically significant (p = 0.066). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Among HIV-infected pregnant women with laboratory evidence of a 
      recent AI, 72% were ZIKV-infected. In this cohort, CNS malformations occurred 
      among infants born to both symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant women with Zika 
      infection.

AB  - Zika virus transmission in Brazil was linked to a large outbreak of microcephaly 
      but less is known about longer term anthropometric and neurological outcomes. We 
      studied a cohort of infants born between October 31, 2015, and January 9, 2016, 
      in a state maternity hospital, followed up for 101 ± 28 days by home visits. 
      Microcephaly (< 2 standard deviations, Intergrowth standard) occurred in 62 of 
      412 (15%) births. Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) was diagnosed in 29 patients. 
      Among CZS patients, we observed a significant gain in anthropometric measures (P 
      < 0.001) but no significant gain in percentile for these measures. The main 
      neurological outcome was epilepsy, occurring in 48% of infants at a rate of 15.6 
      cases per 100 patient-months, frequently requiring multiple anti-seizure 
      medications. The cumulative fatality rate was 7.4% (95% confidence interval: 
      2.1-23.4%). Health-care professionals should be alerted on the high risk of 
      epilepsy and death associated with CZS in early infancy and the need to actively 
      screen for seizures and initiate timely treatment.

TI  - Human Immunodeficiency Virus Antiretroviral Resistance and Transmission in 
      Mother-Infant Pairs Enrolled in a Large Perinatal Study.
PG  - 1770-1777
LID - 10.1093/cid/cix1104 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of antiretroviral drug-associated resistance mutations 
      (DRMs) may be particularly problematic in human immunodeficiency virus 
      (HIV)-infected pregnant women as it can lead to mother-to-child transmission 
      (MTCT) of resistant HIV strains. This study evaluated the prevalence and the 
      effect of antiretroviral DRMs in previously untreated mother-infant pairs. 
      METHODS: A case-control design of 1:4 (1 transmitter to 4 nontransmitters) was 
      utilized to evaluate DRMs as a predictor of HIV MTCT in specimens obtained from 
      mother-infant pairs. ViroSeq HIV-1 genotyping was performed on mother-infant 
      specimens to assess for clinically relevant DRMs. RESULTS: One hundred forty 
      infants acquired HIV infection; of these, 123 mother-infant pairs (88%) had 
      specimens successfully amplified using ViroSeq and assessed for drug resistance 
      genotyping. Additionally, 483 of 560 (86%) women who did not transmit HIV to 
      infants also had samples evaluated for DRMs. Sixty-three of 606 (10%) women had 
      clinically relevant DRMs; 12 (2%) had DRMs against >1 drug class. Among 123 
      HIV-infected infants, 13 (11%) had clinically relevant DRMs, with 3 (2%) 
      harboring DRMs against >1 drug class. In univariate and multivariate analyses, 
      DRMs in mothers were not associated with increased HIV MTCT (adjusted odds ratio, 
      0.8 [95% confidence interval, .4-1.5]). Presence of DRMs in transmitting mothers 
      was strongly associated with DRM presence in their infants (P < .001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Preexisting DRMs were common in untreated HIV-infected pregnant 
      women, but did not increase the risk of HIV MTCT. However, if women with DRMs are 
      not virologically suppressed, they may transmit resistant mutations, thus 
      complicating infant management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal tests are important for prevention of vertical transmission 
      of various infectious agents. The objective of this study was to describe the 
      prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-lymphotropic virus 
      (HTLV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella virus and 
      vaccination coverage against HBV in pregnant adolescents who received care in the 
      city of Belém, Pará, Brazil. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed with 
      324 pregnant adolescents from 2009 to 2010. After the interview and blood 
      collection, the patients were screened for antibodies and/or antigens against 
      HIV-1/2, HTLV-1/2, CMV, rubella virus and HBV. The epidemiological variables were 
      demonstrated using descriptive statistics with the G, χ(2) and Fisher exact 
      tests. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 15.8 years, and the majority 
      (65.4%) had less than 6 years of education. The mean age at first intercourse was 
      14.4 years, and 60.8% reported having a partner aged between 12 and 14 years. The 
      prevalence of HIV infection was 0.3%, and of HTLV infection was 0.6%. Regarding 
      HBV, 0.6% of the participants had acute infection, 9.9% had a previous infection, 
      16.7% had vaccine immunity and 72.8% were susceptible to infection. The presence 
      of anti-HBs was greater in adolescent between 12 and 14 years old (28.8%) while 
      the anti-HBc was greater in adolescent between 15 and 18 years old (10.3%). Most 
      of the adolescents presented the IgG antibody to CMV (96.3%) and rubella (92.3%). 
      None of the participants had acute rubella infection, and 2.2% had anti-CMV IgM. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first report of the seroepidemiology of infectious 
      agents in a population of pregnant adolescents in the Northern region of Brazil. 
      Most of the adolescents had low levels of education, were susceptible to HBV 
      infection and had IgG antibodies to CMV and rubella virus. The prevalence of HBV, 
      HIV and HTLV was similar to that reported in other regions of Brazil. However, 
      the presence of these agents in this younger population reinforces the need for 
      good prenatal follow-up and more comprehensive vaccination campaigns against HBV 
      due to the large number of women susceptible to the virus.

TI  - Development of a melting-curve based multiplex real-time PCR assay for 
      simultaneous detection of Streptococcus agalactiae and genes encoding resistance 
      to macrolides and lincosamides.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus agalactiae or Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains the 
      leading cause of infections in newborns worldwilde. Prenatal GBS screening of 
      pregnant women for vaginal-rectal colonization is recommended in many countries 
      to manage appropriate intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis for those identified 
      as carriers. In this study, a novel melting-curve based multiplex real-time PCR 
      assay for the simultaneous detection of GBS and macrolide and lincosamide 
      resistance markers was developed. The usefulness of the assay was evaluated for 
      rapid and accurate prenatal GBS screening. METHODS: One hundred two pregnant 
      women who were at 35-37 weeks of gestation were enrolled in this study. The 
      analytical performance of the multiplex real-time PCR was first tested using a 
      panel of reference and clinical bacterial and fungal strains. To test the 
      clinical performance, vaginal-rectal swabs were obtained from pregnant women who 
      were seen at the teaching hospital for regular prenatal care. The results of 
      real-time were compared with those obtained from microbiological analyses. 
      RESULTS: The real-time PCR assay showed 100% specificity and a limit of detection 
      of 10(4) colony forming units equivalent per reaction. The prevalence of GBS 
      colonization among the population studied was 15.7% (16/102) based on a positive 
      culture and the real-time PCR results. Agreement between the two assays was found 
      for 11 (68.75%) GBS colonized women. Using the culture-based results as a 
      reference, the multiplex real-time PCR had a sensitivity of 91.7% (11/12, CI 
      59.7-99.6%), a specificity of 95.5% (86/90, CI 89.8-98.7%), a positive predictive 
      value of 73.3% (11/15, CI 44.8-91.1%) and a negative predictive value of 98.9% 
      (86/87, CI 92.9-99.9%). CONCLUSION: The multiplex real-time PCR is a rapid, 
      affordable and sensitive assay for direct detection of GBS in vaginal-rectal 
      swabs.

TI  - Probiotic treatment during neonatal age provides optimal protection against 
      experimental asthma through the modulation of microbiota and T cells.
PG  - 155-169
LID - 10.1093/intimm/dxy011 [doi]
AB  - The incidence of allergic diseases, which increased to epidemic proportions in 
      developed countries over the last few decades, has been correlated with altered 
      gut microbiota colonization. Although probiotics may play a critical role in the 
      restoration of gut homeostasis, their efficiency in the control of allergy is 
      controversial. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of probiotic treatment 
      initiated at neonatal or adult ages on the suppression of experimental ovalbumin 
      (OVA)-induced asthma. Neonatal or adult mice were orally treated with probiotic 
      bacteria and subjected to OVA-induced allergy. Asthma-like symptoms, microbiota 
      composition and frequencies of the total CD4+ T lymphocytes and CD4+Foxp3+ 
      regulatory T (Treg) cells were evaluated in both groups. Probiotic administration 
      to neonates, but not to adults, was necessary and sufficient for the absolute 
      prevention of experimental allergen-induced sensitization. The neonatally 
      acquired tolerance, transferrable to probiotic-untreated adult recipients by 
      splenic cells from tolerant donors, was associated with modulation of gut 
      bacterial composition, augmented levels of cecum butyrate and selective 
      accumulation of Treg cells in the airways. Our findings reveal that a cross-talk 
      between a healthy microbiota and qualitative features inherent to neonatal T 
      cells, especially in the Treg cell subset, might support the beneficial effect of 
      perinatal exposure to probiotic bacteria on the development of long-term 
      tolerance to allergens.

AB  - AIMS: The aim of the study is to verify the knowledge and practices of health 
      professionals working in prenatal care (PNC) related with syphilis during 
      pregnancy and to identify the main barriers to the implementation of protocols 
      for the control of this disease. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in Teresina, 
      Brazil, from January to May 2015, was conducted with 366 physicians and nurses 
      working in PNC, corresponding to 70% of eligible professionals. We evaluated 20 
      knowledge and practice criteria related to the diagnosis and treatment of 
      syphilis during pregnancy with a 95% compliance standard. We performed 
      descriptive analysis of the data and used χ(2) statistical test to verify 
      differences according to professional category. RESULTS: Only 2 criteria, 
      "knowledge about mother to child transmission according to gestational age" and 
      "counselling on infection," reached 95% compliance. Knowledge of the 
      epidemiological profile of congenital syphilis and the goal of elimination of 
      congenital syphilis and knowledge about serological tests had scores below 50%, 
      while practices related with posttest counselling, cure control, and treatment of 
      partners reached 60%. We identified organisational barriers related to the late 
      initiation of PNC, to the delayed return of syphilis test results, to the 
      application of benzathine penicillin in primary care units and to the treatment 
      of partners. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies for early initiation of PNC, implementation 
      of rapid tests for syphilis, ensuring treatment of pregnant women with 
      penicillin, adequate partner treatment, and continued education of health 
      professionals on clinical management and counselling in sexually transmitted 
      diseases are necessary to eliminate congenital syphilis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) is related to severe 
      neurological manifestations. A previous study in Brazil reported an increased 
      incidence of non-severe congenital heart defects in infants with diagnosis of 
      congenital Zika syndrome but without laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection in 
      the mother or infant. The objective of this study is to report echocardiographic 
      (ECHO) findings in infants with laboratory confirmed antenatal exposure to ZIKV. 
      METHODOLOGY: Cross sectional study of cardiologic assessments of infants born 
      between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to ZIKV 
      in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. RESULTS: The study enrolled 120 children with a median 
      age of 97 days (1 to 376 days). In utero exposure to ZIKV was confirmed in 97 
      children (80,8%) through positive maternal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      results during pregnancy or a positive PCR result at birth; 23 additional 
      children (19.2%) had maternal positive PCR results during pregnancy and 
      postnatally. Forty- eight infants (40%) had cardiac defects noted on ECHO. 
      Thirteen infants (10.8%) had major cardiac defects (atrial septal defect, 
      ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). None of the defects were 
      severe. The frequency of major defects was higher in infants whose mothers had a 
      rash in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, or who had altered Central Nervous System 
      (CNS) imaging postnatally or were preterm. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with in utero 
      ZIKV exposure have a higher prevalence of major cardiac defects, however none 
      were severe enough to require immediate intervention. For this reason, guidelines 
      for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow general 
      newborn screening guidelines, which significantly reduces the burden of 
      performing emergent fetal or neonatal ECHOs in a setting where resources are not 
      available, such as most Brazilian municipalities.

AB  - AIMS: to estimate the mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV among infected 
      pregnant women identified in the "Birth in Brazil" study and to evaluate care 
      practices provided in order to identify missed opportunities at preventing the 
      MTCT of HIV infection in the country. METHODS: Descriptive study using data 
      obtained from the consultation of different databases: the "Birth in Brazil" 
      study database and the Brazilian National Information Systems (NIS) databases. We 
      used cases of pregnant women infected with HIV identified in the "Birth in 
      Brazil" study, and cases of AIDS in children under 5 years old identified in the 
      NIS, to estimate the MTCT of HIV infection in the country, with a 95% confidence 
      interval. We also estimated the HIV cascade (HIV diagnosis; use of antiretroviral 
      treatment (ART) during pregnancy, labour, and for the newborn; adequate care 
      during childbirth considering viral load at birth; and no breastfeeding) using 
      data from the same sources. RESULTS: MTCT of HIV of 2.0% (95% CI 0.3%-13.8%). At 
      birth, 84.0% of HIV infected woman showed a positive HIV diagnosis, 74.9% 
      received combined ART during pregnancy, 80.7% received ART during childbirth, 
      77.1% received adequate care during childbirth, 86.8% of newborns received ART 
      within the first 24 hours after birth, and 2.8% of newborns were breastfed. 
      Considering all steps, 61.3% of the women (95% CI 48.3%-72.8%) received all 
      available medical interventions. In the analysis restricted to women identified 
      in the NIS, 65.3% (95% CI 48.0%-79.3%) of HIV infected women received all 
      available medical interventions. CONCLUSION: Brazil has healthcare policies that 
      guarantee free access to tests, ART and substitutes for maternal milk. However, 
      missed opportunities to prevent MTCT of HIV were identified in at least one-third 
      of women and may be making it difficult to reach HIV-elimination targets 
      especially in the less developed country regions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effect of Trypanosoma cruzi infection on fertility, 
      gestation outcome, and maternal-fetal transmission in guinea pigs (Cavia 
      porcellus). METHODS: Animals were infected with T. cruzi H4 strain (TcI lineage) 
      before gestation (IBG) or during gestation (IDG). Tissue and sera samples of dams 
      and fetuses were obtained near parturition. RESULTS: All IBG and IDG dams were 
      seropositive by two tests, and exhibited blood parasite load of 1.62±2.2 and 
      50.1±62 parasites/μl, respectively, by quantitative PCR. Histological evaluation 
      showed muscle fiber degeneration and cellular necrosis in all infected dams. 
      Parasite nests were not detected in infected dams by histology. However, qPCR 
      analysis detected parasites-eq/g heart tissue of 153±104.7 and 169.3±129.4 in IBG 
      and IDG dams, respectively. All fetuses of infected dams were positive for 
      anti-parasite IgG antibodies and tissue parasites by qPCR, but presented a low 
      level of tissue inflammatory infiltrate. Fetuses of IDG (vs. IBG) dams exhibited 
      higher degree of muscle fiber degeneration and cellular necrosis in the heart and 
      skeletal tissues. The placental tissue exhibited no inflammatory lesions and 
      amastigote nests, yet parasites-eq/g of 381.2±34.3 and 79.2±84.9 were detected in 
      IDG and IBG placentas, respectively. Fetal development was compromised, and 
      evidenced by a decline in weight, crow-rump length, and abdominal width in both 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: T. cruzi TcI has a high capacity of congenital transmission 
      even when it was inoculated at a very low dose before or during gestation. Tissue 
      lesions, parasite load, and fetal under development provide evidence for high 
      virulence of the parasite during pregnancy. Despite finding of high parasite 
      burden by qPCR, placentas were protected from cellular damage. Our studies offer 
      an experimental model to study the efficacy of vaccines and drugs against 
      congenital transmission of T. cruzi. These results also call for T. cruzi 
      screening in pregnant women and adequate follow up of the newborns in endemic 
      areas.

PG  - 1
LID - 10.1038/s41598-017-17765-5 [doi]
LID - 1
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently caused a pandemic disease, and many cases of ZIKV 
      infection in pregnant women resulted in abortion, stillbirth, deaths and 
      congenital defects including microcephaly, which now has been proposed as ZIKV 
      congenital syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the in situ immune response 
      profile and mechanisms of neuronal cell damage in fatal Zika microcephaly cases. 
      Brain tissue samples were collected from 15 cases, including 10 microcephalic 
      ZIKV-positive neonates with fatal outcome and five neonatal control 
      flavivirus-negative neonates that died due to other causes, but with preserved 
      central nervous system (CNS) architecture. In microcephaly cases, the 
      histopathological features of the tissue samples were characterized in three CNS 
      areas (meninges, perivascular space, and parenchyma). The changes found were 
      mainly calcification, necrosis, neuronophagy, gliosis, microglial nodules, and 
      inflammatory infiltration of mononuclear cells. The in situ immune response 
      against ZIKV in the CNS of newborns is complex. Despite the predominant 
      expression of Th2 cytokines, other cytokines such as Th1, Th17, Treg, Th9, and 
      Th22 are involved to a lesser extent, but are still likely to participate in the 
      immunopathogenic mechanisms of neural disease in fatal cases of microcephaly 
      caused by ZIKV.

AB  - In this review, we give an overview of aspects related to the congenital 
      transmission of the Zika virus (ZIKV). Although we acknowledge that important 
      advances in research on ZIKV pathogenesis have come from studies using animal 
      models, particularly non-human primates, this review emphasizes studies using 
      ex-vivo human cells and tissues as well as natural infections in pregnant women. 
      The possible routes used by ZIKV to cross or breach the placental barrier and 
      infect the fetal central nervous system are presented. Understanding the viral 
      infection biology and ZIKV pathogenesis during pregnancy may guide the design of 
      affordable antiviral strategies to benefit pregnant women in areas at risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the coverage of the reporting of cases of HIV-infected 
      pregnant women, to estimate the increase in the coverage of the reporting with 
      the routine search of data in other Brazilian health information systems, and to 
      identify missed opportunities for identification of HIV-infected pregnant women 
      in Brazilian maternity hospitals. METHODS: This is a descriptive study on the 
      linkage of Brazilian databases with primary data from the "Nascer no Brasil" 
      study and secondary database collection from national health information systems. 
      The "Nascer no Brasil" is a national-based study carried out in 2011-2012 with 
      23,894 pregnant women, which identified HIV-infected pregnant women using 
      prenatal and medical records. We searched for cases of HIV-infected pregnant 
      women identified in the "Nascer no Brasil" study in the Information System of 
      Notifiable Diseases, the Control System for Laboratory Tests of the National 
      CD4+/CD8+ Lymphocyte Count and HIV Viral Load Network, and the Logistics Control 
      System for Medications. We used the OpenRecLink software for the linkage of 
      databases. We estimated the notification coverage, with the respective confidence 
      interval, of the evaluated Brazilian health information systems. RESULTS: We 
      estimated the coverage of the reporting of HIV-infected pregnant women in the 
      Information System of Notifiable Diseases as 57.1% (95%CI 42.9-70.2), and we 
      located 89.3% of the HIV-infected pregnant women (95%CI 81.2-94.2) in some of the 
      Brazilian health information systems researched. The search in other national 
      health information systems would result in an increase of 57.1% of the reported 
      cases. We identified no missed opportunities for the diagnosis of HIV+ in 
      pregnant women in the maternity hospitals evaluated by the "Nascer no Brasil" 
      study. CONCLUSIONS: The routine search for information in other Brazilian health 
      information systems, a procedure carried out by the Ministry of Health for cases 
      of AIDS in adults and children, should be adopted for cases of HIV in pregnancy.

TI  - No association between periodontitis and preterm low birth weight: a case-control 
      study.
PG  - 71-76
LID - 10.1007/s00404-017-4556-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the association between periodontitis in 
      pregnant women and adverse pregnancy outcomes by heeding confounding risk factors 
      for preterm low birth weight infants. METHODS: This study was reported according 
      to The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology 
      (STROBE) Statement. A case-control study was conducted. Medical records of all 
      pregnant women attending a prenatal care clinic were screened. Those between 21 
      and 34 years and gestational age of 28-32 weeks were initially enrolled in the 
      study. The exclusion criteria were then applied: diabetes mellitus, genitourinary 
      tract infections, or HIV infection; previous multiple gestations; previous 
      preterm birth/low birth weight infants; in vitro fertilization procedures; 
      placental, cervical/uterine abnormalities; history of infertility; history of 
      drug abuse; and any medical conditions that required antibiotics prophylaxis. 
      Patients' anthropometric, demographic, and behavioral characteristics were 
      collected. The periodontal clinical parameters were obtained from six sites per 
      tooth: clinical attachment level, probing pocket depth, dental plaque index, and 
      gingival bleeding index. Women were then allocated into two groups: mothers of 
      preterm and/or low birth weight newborns (cases) and mothers of full-term and 
      normal birth weight newborns (controls). RESULTS: Periodontal clinical parameters 
      were analyzed and reported separately for each group, and no significant 
      differences were observed (p > 0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that 
      periodontal clinical parameters were not associated with the adverse pregnancy 
      outcomes. CONCLUSION(S): After controlling for confounding factors, our results 
      suggest that maternal periodontal disease is not a risk factor associated with 
      preterm low birth weight infants.

TI  - Prevalence of syphilis and HIV infection during pregnancy in incarcerated women

AB  - This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of syphilis and HIV infection during 
      pregnancy, the mother to child transmission of syphilis and the incidence of 
      congenital syphilis in incarcerated women in Brazil; to compare these rates to 
      those observed in pregnant women outside of jail; and to verify the maternal 
      factors associated with syphilis infection during pregnancy in free and 
      incarcerated women. We used data from two nationwide studies conducted during the 
      period 2011-2014. The Birth in Brazil study included 23,894 free women cared for 
      in 266 hospitals. The Maternal and Infant Health in Prisons study included 495 
      incarcerated pregnant women or mothers living with their children, according to a 
      census conducted in 33 female prisons. The same case definitions and data 
      collection methods were used in both studies. The chi-square test was used to 
      compare the characteristics of incarcerated and free women with a significance of 
      0.05. For incarcerated women, the estimated prevalence of syphilis during 
      pregnancy was 8.7% (95%CI: 5.7-13.1) and for HIV infection 3.3% (95%CI: 1.7-6.6); 
      the estimated mother to child transmission of syphilis was 66.7% (95%CI: 
      44.7-83.2) and the incidence of congenital syphilis was 58.1 per 1,000 living 
      newborns (95%CI: 40.4-82.8). Incarcerated women had a greater prevalence of 
      syphilis and HIV infection during pregnancy, lower quality of antenatal care and 
      higher levels of social vulnerability. Syphilis infection showed to be an 
      indicator of social vulnerability in free women, but not in incarcerated women. 
      Health initiatives in prison are necessary to reduce healthcare inequalities and 
      should include adequate antenatal and birth care.

AB  - The burden of arboviruses in the Americas is high and may result in long-term 
      sequelae with infants disabled by Zika virus infection (ZIKV) and arthritis 
      caused by infection with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). We aimed to identify 
      environmental drivers of arbovirus epidemics to predict where the next epidemics 
      will occur and prioritize municipalities for vector control and eventual 
      vaccination. We screened sera and urine samples (n = 10,459) from residents of 48 
      municipalities in the state of Rio de Janeiro for CHIKV, dengue virus (DENV), and 
      ZIKV by molecular PCR diagnostics. Further, we assessed the spatial pattern of 
      arbovirus incidence at the municipal and neighborhood scales and the timing of 
      epidemics and major rainfall events. Lab-confirmed cases included 1,717 
      infections with ZIKV (43.8%) and 2,170 with CHIKV (55.4%) and only 29 (<1%) with 
      DENV. ZIKV incidence was greater in neighborhoods with little access to municipal 
      water infrastructure (r = -0.47, p = 1.2x10-8). CHIKV incidence was weakly 
      correlated with urbanization (r = 0.2, p = 0.02). Rains began in October 2015 and 
      were followed one month later by the largest wave of ZIKV epidemic. ZIKV cases 
      markedly declined in February 2016, which coincided with the start of a CHIKV 
      outbreak. Rainfall predicted ZIKV and CHIKV with a lead time of 3 weeks each 
      time. The association between rainfall and epidemics reflects vector ecology as 
      the larval stages of Aedes aegypti require pools of water to develop. The 
      temporal dynamics of ZIKV and CHIKV may be explained by the shorter incubation 
      period of the viruses in the mosquito vector; 2 days for CHIKV versus 10 days for 
      ZIKV.

TI  - The impact of antibody profile in thrombosis associated with primary 
      antiphospholipid syndrome.
PG  - 1163-1169
LID - 10.1002/ajh.24875 [doi]
AB  - Triple positivity (TP) for antiphospholipid antibodies(aPL) may identify aPL 
      carriers with poorer prognosis. The clinical impact of TP in primary 
      antiphospholipid syndrome(PAPS) remains unclear and further clinical evidences 
      are needed to validate TP as a marker of severity. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the impact of TP on the clinical course of PAPS with thrombosis(t-PAPS). 
      We performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of t-PAPS patients, comparing 
      groups of patients with TP and non-TP profiles according to their demographic, 
      clinical and laboratory features. We included 105 patients with t-PAPS, the 
      median follow-up time of 3.7 years. Twenty-two patients(21%) had TP; the 
      demographic distribution, the presence of cardiovascular risk factors and the 
      site of thrombosis were similar between TP and non-TP patients. The frequency of 
      thrombotic events did not differ between TP and non-TP patients during the study 
      period. Pregnancy morbidities were more frequent in women with t-PAPS and TP than 
      in those with non-TP profile (80% vs. 52.8%, P = 0.05). Patients with t-PAPS and 
      TP presented, at diagnosis, higher dRVVT ratio (median R = 2.44 vs. 1.57, 
      P < 0.0001), higher aCL titer (median = 50UI vs. 35 UI, P < 0.0001), lower C3 
      levels (median = 1.08 vs. 1.30 mg dL(-1) , P = 0.001), lower C4 levels 
      (median = 0.22 vs. 0.25 mg dL(-1) , P = 0.05) and higher frequency of positive 
      ANA test (50% vs. 20%, P = 0.008) than patients with t-PAPS and non-TP. 
      Lower-than-normal levels of C3 was independently associated with TP (OR = 5.1, 
      P = 0.02). The presence of TP in patients with t-PAPS was associated with immune 
      derangement, with no effect on the clinical course of the disease.

AB  - Trophoblast infection by Toxoplasma gondii plays a pivotal role in the vertical 
      transmission of toxoplasmosis. Here, we investigate whether the antibiotic 
      therapy with azithromycin, spiramycin and sulfadiazine/pyrimethamine are 
      effective to control trophoblast infection by two Brazilian T. gondii genotypes, 
      TgChBrUD1 or TgChBrUD2. Two antibiotic protocols were evaluated, as follow: i) 
      pre-treatment of T. gondii-tachyzoites with selected antibiotics prior 
      trophoblast infection and ii) post-treatment of infected trophoblasts. The 
      infection index/replication and the impact of the antibiotic therapy on the 
      cytokine milieu were characterized. It was observed that TgChBrUD2 infection 
      induced lower infection index/replication as compared to TgChBrUD1. Regardless 
      the therapeutic protocol, azithromycin was more effective to control the 
      trophoblast infection with both genotypes when compared to conventional 
      antibiotics. Azithromycin induced higher IL-12 production in TgChBrUD1-infected 
      cells that may synergize the anti-parasitic effect. In contrast, the 
      effectiveness of azithromycin to control the TgChBrUD2-infection was not 
      associated with the IL-12 production. BeWo-trophoblasts display distinct 
      susceptibility to T. gondii genotypes and the azithromycin treatment showed to be 
      more effective than conventional antibiotics to control the T. gondii 
      infection/replication regardless the parasite genotype.

AB  - The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak demonstrates that cost-effective clinical 
      diagnostics are urgently needed to detect and distinguish viral infections to 
      improve patient care. Unlike dengue virus (DENV), ZIKV infections during 
      pregnancy correlate with severe birth defects, including microcephaly and 
      neurological disorders. Because ZIKV and DENV are related flaviviruses, their 
      homologous proteins and nucleic acids can cause cross-reactions and 
      false-positive results in molecular, antigenic, and serologic diagnostics. We 
      report the characterization of monoclonal antibody pairs that have been 
      translated into rapid immunochromatography tests to specifically detect the viral 
      nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein antigen and distinguish the four DENV serotypes 
      (DENV1-4) and ZIKV without cross-reaction. To complement visual test analysis and 
      remove user subjectivity in reading test results, we used image processing and 
      data analysis for data capture and test result quantification. Using a 30-μl 
      serum sample, the sensitivity and specificity values of the DENV1-4 tests and the 
      pan-DENV test, which detects all four dengue serotypes, ranged from 0.76 to 1.00. 
      Sensitivity/specificity for the ZIKV rapid test was 0.81/0.86, respectively, 
      using a 150-μl serum input. Serum ZIKV NS1 protein concentrations were about 
      10-fold lower than corresponding DENV NS1 concentrations in infected patients; 
      moreover, ZIKV NS1 protein was not detected in polymerase chain reaction-positive 
      patient urine samples. Our rapid immunochromatography approach and reagents have 
      immediate application in differential clinical diagnosis of acute ZIKV and DENV 
      cases, and the platform can be applied toward developing rapid antigen 
      diagnostics for emerging viruses.

TI  - Evolution of Chagas' disease in Brazil. Epidemiological perspective and 
      challenges for the future: a critical review.
PG  - 289-295
LID - 10.1177/1757913916671160 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This article aimed to provide a critical review of the evolution of Chagas' 
      disease (ChD) in Brazil, its magnitude, historical development and management, 
      and challenges for the future. METHODS: A literature search was performed using 
      PubMed, SciELO and Google Scholar and throughout collected articles' references. 
      Narrative analysis was structured around five main themes identified: vector 
      transmission, control programme, transfusion, oral and congenital transmission. 
      RESULTS: In Brazil, the Chagas' Disease Control Programme was fully implemented 
      in the 1980s, when it reached practically all the endemic areas, and in 1991, the 
      Southern Cone Initiative was created, aiming to control the disease transmission 
      through eliminating the Triatoma infestans and controlling blood banks. As a 
      result, the prevalence of chagasic donors in blood banks reduced from 4.4% in the 
      1980s to 0.2% in 2005. In 2006, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) certified 
      the interruption of transmission of ChD through this vector in Brazil. However, 
      there are still challenges, such as the domiciliation of new vector species, the 
      need for medical care of the infected individuals, the prevention of alternative 
      mechanisms of transmission, the loss of political concern regarding the disease 
      and the weakening of the control programme. CONCLUSION: Despite the progress 
      towards control, there are still many challenges ahead to maintain and expand 
      such control and minimise the risk of re-emergence.

AB  - The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with congenital 
      malformations has prompted the rapid development of vaccines. Although efficacy 
      with multiple viral vaccine platforms has been established in animals, no study 
      has addressed protection during pregnancy. We tested in mice two vaccine 
      platforms, a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated modified mRNA vaccine encoding ZIKV 
      prM and E genes and a live-attenuated ZIKV strain encoding an NS1 protein without 
      glycosylation, for their ability to protect against transmission to the fetus. 
      Vaccinated dams challenged with a heterologous ZIKV strain at embryo day 6 (E6) 
      and evaluated at E13 showed markedly diminished levels of viral RNA in maternal, 
      placental, and fetal tissues, which resulted in protection against placental 
      damage and fetal demise. As modified mRNA and live-attenuated vaccine platforms 
      can restrict in utero transmission of ZIKV in mice, their further development in 
      humans to prevent congenital ZIKV syndrome is warranted.

TI  - Malaria in Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela: current challenges in malaria 
      control and elimination.

AB  - In spite of significant progress towards malaria control and elimination achieved 
      in South America in the 2000s, this mosquito-transmitted tropical disease remains 
      an important public health concern in the region. Most malaria cases in South 
      America come from Amazon rain forest areas in northern countries, where more than 
      half of malaria is caused by Plasmodium vivax, while Plasmodium falciparum 
      malaria incidence has decreased in recent years. This review discusses current 
      malaria data, policies and challenges in four South American Amazon countries: 
      Brazil, Colombia, Peru and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Challenges to 
      continuing efforts to further decrease malaria incidence in this region include: 
      a significant increase in malaria cases in recent years in Venezuela, evidence of 
      submicroscopic and asymptomatic infections, peri-urban malaria, gold 
      mining-related malaria, malaria in pregnancy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
      (G6PD) deficiency and primaquine use, and possible under-detection of Plasmodium 
      malariae. Some of these challenges underscore the need to implement appropriate 
      tools and procedures in specific regions, such as a field-compatible molecular 
      malaria test, a P. malariae-specific test, malaria diagnosis and appropriate 
      treatment as part of regular antenatal care visits, G6PD test before primaquine 
      administration for P. vivax cases (with weekly primaquine regimen for G6PD 
      deficient individuals), single low dose of primaquine for P. falciparum malaria 
      in Colombia, and national and regional efforts to contain malaria spread in 
      Venezuela urgently needed especially in mining areas. Joint efforts and 
      commitment towards malaria control and elimination should be strategized based on 
      examples of successful regional malaria fighting initiatives, such as PAMAFRO and 
      RAVREDA/AMI.

TI  - Accuracy of Zika virus disease case definition during simultaneous Dengue and 
      Chikungunya epidemics.
PG  - e0179725
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0179725 [doi]
LID - e0179725
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika is a new disease in the American continent and its surveillance 
      is of utmost importance, especially because of its ability to cause neurological 
      manifestations as Guillain-Barré syndrome and serious congenital malformations 
      through vertical transmission. The detection of suspected cases by the 
      surveillance system depends on the case definition adopted. As the laboratory 
      diagnosis of Zika infection still relies on the use of expensive and complex 
      molecular techniques with low sensitivity due to a narrow window of detection, 
      most suspected cases are not confirmed by laboratory tests, mainly reserved for 
      pregnant women and newborns. In this context, an accurate definition of a 
      suspected Zika case is crucial in order for the surveillance system to gauge the 
      magnitude of an epidemic. METHODOLOGY: We evaluated the accuracy of various Zika 
      case definitions in a scenario where Dengue and Chikungunya viruses co-circulate. 
      Signs and symptoms that best discriminated PCR confirmed Zika from other 
      laboratory confirmed febrile or exanthematic diseases were identified to propose 
      and test predictive models for Zika infection based on these clinical features. 
      RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our derived score prediction model had the best 
      performance because it demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity, 
      86·6% and 78·3%, respectively. This Zika case definition also had the highest 
      values for auROC (0·903) and R2 (0·417), and the lowest Brier score 0·096. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In areas where multiple arboviruses circulate, the presence of rash 
      with pruritus or conjunctival hyperemia, without any other general clinical 
      manifestations such as fever, petechia or anorexia is the best Zika case 
      definition.

TI  - Pacemaker Implants in Children and Adolescents with Chagas Disease in Brazil: 
      18-Year Incidence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chagas disease continues to be a serious public health problem, and 
      accounts for 25-30% of the indications for cardiac stimulation in Brazil. 
      OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients 
      with Chagas disease, younger than 18 years, who had undergone pacemaker 
      implantation in Brazil between 1994 and 2011, and its temporal trend. METHODS: 
      This was a cross-sectional analysis of data from the Brazilian Pacemaker Registry 
      database. The following variables were analyzed: year when pacemaker was 
      implanted, location, age, sex, ethnic group, functional class and the main 
      electrocardiographic findings at baseline. RESULTS: In a total of 183,123 
      implants performed between 1994 and 2011, 214 implants of cardiac stimulation 
      device in Chagas disease patients aged younger than 18 years were identified. 
      Mean age at implantation was 5.6 ± 6.2 years. Second- and third-degree 
      atrioventricular blocks corresponded to 71% of indications for pacemaker 
      implantation. Fifty-six percent of the procedures were performed in the southeast 
      region. Regarding the total number of pacemaker implants per year, there was a 
      remarkable increase in the implants for all causes. However, time series analysis 
      of the implants in Chagas disease patients younger than 18 years revealed a 
      significant reduction in the annual number of implants. CONCLUSION: There has 
      been an important reduction in the number of pacemaker implantations among 
      children and adolescents with Chagas disease, suggesting a reduction in the 
      vertical transmission of the parasite. FUNDAMENTO: A doença de Chagas mantém-se 
      como sério problema de saúde pública e tem sido responsável por aproximadamente 
      25% a 30% das indicações de estimulação cardíaca no Brasil. OBJETIVO: Estudar as 
      características clínicas e epidemiológicas dos pacientes menores de 18 anos 
      portadores de doença de Chagas submetidos a implante de marca-passo no território 
      brasileiro entre 1994 e 2011, e sua tendência temporal. MÉTODOS: Trata-se de um 
      estudo retrospectivo que utilizou informações coletadas pelo Registro Brasileiro 
      de Marca-passo. As variáveis analisadas foram: ano do implante, localidade, 
      idade, sexo, grupo étnico dos pacientes; classificação funcional e os principais 
      achados eletrocardiográficos de base. RESULTADOS: Em um total de 183 123 
      implantes realizados entre 1994 e 2011, foram identificados 214 implantes de 
      dispositivos de estimulação cardíaca em portadores de doença de Chagas com idade 
      inferior a 18 anos. A média de idade no momento do implante foi de 5,6 ± 6,2 
      anos. Bloqueios atrioventriculares de 2º e 3º graus foram responsáveis por 71% 
      das indicações. Dos procedimentos, 55,6% foram realizados na região sudeste. Em 
      relação ao total de implantes de marca-passo por ano, observamos um aumento 
      importante e significante de implante por todas as causas. Entretanto, quando 
      avaliamos a série temporal de implantes em pacientes com doença de Chagas menores 
      que 18 anos, observamos uma redução expressiva e significativa no número anual de 
      implantes. CONCLUSÃO: Observa-se uma redução importante do número de implantes de 
      marca-passo em crianças e adolescente chagásicos, o que sugere uma redução da 
      transmissão vertical do parasita.

TI  - Zika puzzle in Brazil: peculiar conditions of viral introduction and 
      dissemination - A Review.
PG  - 319-327
LID - 10.1590/0074-02760160510 [doi]
AB  - This article discusses the peculiar conditions that favoured the unexpected 
      introduction of Zika virus into the poorest northeastern region of Brazil in 
      2015, its speed of transmission to other Brazilian states, other Latin American 
      countries and other regions, and the severity of related neurological disorders 
      in newborns and adults. Contrasting with evidence that Zika had so far caused 
      only mild cases in humans in the last six decades, the epidemiological scenario 
      of this outbreak in Brazil indicates dramatic health effects: in 2015, an 
      increase of 20-fold in notified cases of microcephaly and/or central nervous 
      system (CNS) alterations suggestive of Zika congenital infection, followed by an 
      exponential increase in 2016, with 2366 cumulative cases confirmed in the country 
      by the end of December 2016. A significant increase in Guillain-Barré syndrome in 
      adults has also been reported. Factors involved in viral dissemination, neural 
      pathogenesis and routes of transmission in Brazil are examined, such as the role 
      of social and environmental factors and the controversies involved in the 
      hypothesis of antibody-dependent enhancement, to explain the incidence of 
      congenital Zika syndrome in Brazil. Responses to the Zika outbreak and the 
      development of new products are also discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the associations between first trimester 25-hydroxyvitamin 
      D [25(OH)D] status and changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride 
      (TG) concentrations, TG/HDL-c, and TC/HDL-c ratios throughout pregnancy. We 
      hypothesized that first trimester 25(OH)D inadequacy is associated with lower 
      concentrations of HDL-c and higher LDL-c, TC, TG, TG/HDL-c, and TC/HDL-c ratios 
      throughout pregnancy. METHODS: A prospective cohort study with 3 visits at 5-13 
      (baseline), 20-26, and 30-36 gestational weeks, recruited 194 pregnant women 
      attending a public health care center in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Plasma 25(OH)D 
      concentrations were measured in the first trimester using liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 25(OH)D concentrations were classified 
      as adequate (≥75nmol/L) or inadequate (<75nmol/L). Serum TC, HDL-c, and TG 
      concentrations were measured enzymatically. Crude and adjusted longitudinal 
      linear mixed-effects models were employed to evaluate the association between the 
      first trimester 25(OH)D status and changes in serum lipid concentrations 
      throughout pregnancy. Confounders adjusted for in the multiple analysis were age, 
      homeostatic model assessment (HOMA), early pregnancy BMI, leisure time physical 
      activity before pregnancy, energy intake, and gestational age. RESULTS: At 
      baseline, 69% of the women had inadequate concentrations of 25(OH)D. Women with 
      25(OH)D inadequacy had higher mean LDL-c than those with adequate concentrations 
      (91.3 vs. 97.5mg/dL; P=0.064) at baseline. TC, HDL-c, LDL-c TG, TG/HDL-c ratios, 
      and TC/HDL-c ratios, increased throughout pregnancy independently of 25(OH)D 
      concentrations (ANOVA for repeated measures P<0.001). The adjusted models showed 
      direct associations between the first trimester 25(OH)D status and changes in TC 
      (β=9.53; 95%CI=1.12-17.94), LDL-c (β=9.99; 95% CI=3.62-16.36) concentrations, and 
      TC/HDL-c ratios (β=0.16; 95% CI=0.01-0.31) throughout pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Inadequate plasma 25(OH)D concentrations during early pregnancy were associated 
      with more pronounced changes of TC, LDL-c concentrations, and TC/HDL-c ratios 
      throughout pregnancy. Changes in these cardiovascular markers suggest the 
      importance of ensuring adequate vitamin D status at the beginning of pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There are limited data regarding Xpert performance to detect Group B 
      Streptococcus (GBS) in HIV-infected pregnant women. We evaluated the accuracy of 
      a rapid real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test in a cohort of 
      HIV-infected women. METHODS: At 35-37 weeks of pregnancy, a pair of combined 
      rectovaginal swabs were collected for two GBS assays in a cohort of sequentially 
      included HIV-infected women in Rio de Janeiro: (1) culture; and (2) real-time PCR 
      assay [GeneXpert GBS (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA)]. Using culture as the reference, 
      sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative-likelihood ratios were estimated. 
      RESULTS: From June 2012 to February 2015, 337 pregnant women met inclusion 
      criteria. One woman was later excluded, due to failure to obtain a result in the 
      index test; 336 were included in the analyses. The GBS colonization rate was 
      19.04%. Sensitivity and specificity of the GeneXpert GBS assay were 85.94% (95% 
      CI: 75.38-92.42) and 94.85% (95% CI: 91.55-96.91), respectively. Positive and 
      negative predictive values were 79.71% (95% CI: 68.78-87.51) and 96.63% (95% CI: 
      93.72-98.22), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: GeneXpert GBS is an acceptable test for 
      the identification of GBS colonization in HIV-infected pregnant women and 
      represents a reasonable option to detect GBS colonization in settings where 
      culture is not feasible.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chagas disease (CD) is currently considered a neglected disease; 
      hence, identifying the factors associated with its high prevalence is essential. 
      This study aimed to identify the seroprevalence of and the possible factors 
      associated with CD in inhabitants of the City of Limoeiro do Norte, Northeastern 
      Brazil. METHODS: Between April and November 2013, blood collection was conducted 
      and a semi-structured questionnaire was administered. Blood samples that showed 
      positive or possible serology for anti-Trypanosoma cruzi antibodies based on 
      indirect immunofluorescence, hemagglutination indirect, and an enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay were analyzed. Associations between CD positivity and the 
      study variables were analyzed using prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence 
      intervals (CI). RESULTS: A total of 812 individuals were analyzed, of which T. 
      cruzi seropositivity was determined in 4.2% (34 individuals). Sociodemographic 
      variables showing a significant association with T. cruzi positivity included age 
      >50 years (PR = 27.6; 95% CI = 6.66-114.4), elementary level education (PR = 
      5.15; 95% CI = 1.83-14.47), and retirement (PR = 7.25; 95% CI = 3.72-14.14). 
      Positivity for T. cruzi was 6.17 times higher in those who had a history of 
      living in rammed earth houses compared with those who did not (95% CI = 
      2.19-17.37). There was no evidence of vertical transmission in the individuals 
      studied. Among the individuals infected with T. cruzi, the majority reported 
      having a comorbidity (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the 
      seroprevalence of CD and identified factors associated with a high prevalence of 
      CD.

TI  - Emerging Zika Virus Infection: A Rapidly Evolving Situation.
PG  - 61-86
LID - 10.1007/5584_2016_187 [doi]
AB  - Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, firstly identified in Uganda and 
      responsible for sporadic human cases in Africa and Asia until recently, when 
      large outbreak occurred in Pacific Ocean and the Americas. Since the main vectors 
      during its spread outside of Africa have been Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti 
      mosquitoes, which are widely distributed all over the world, there is urgent need 
      for a coordinated response for prevention and spread of ZIKV epidemics.Despite 
      clinical manifestation of Zika virus infection are usually mild and self 
      limiting, there are reports suggesting, during the recent epidemic, an 
      association of ZIKV infection with severe consequences, including fetal/newborn 
      microcephaly, due to vertical in utero transmission, autoimmune-neurological 
      presentations including cranial nerve dysfunction, and Guillain-Barré Syndrome in 
      adults. The primary mode of transmission of Zika virus between humans is through 
      the bite of an infected female mosquito of the Aedes genus, but also sexual and 
      blood transfusion transmission may occur. Moreover, a case of non-sexual spread 
      from one person to another has been described, indicating that we still have more 
      to learn about Zika transmission.Biological basis for pathogenetic effects are 
      under investigation. Laboratory diagnosis is challenging since, so far, there are 
      no "gold standard" diagnostic tools, and the low and short viremia in the acute 
      phase, and together with the high cross-reactivity among the members of 
      flavivirus genus are the most challenging aspects to be overcome.

AB  - With the urbanisation of the population in developing countries and the process 
      of globalisation, Chagas has become an emerging disease in the urban areas of 
      endemic and non-endemic countries. In 2006, it was estimated that the prevalence 
      of Chagas disease among the general Bolivian population was 6.8%. The aim of the 
      present study was to determine the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection 
      among Bolivian immigrants living in São Paulo, Brazil. This study had a sample of 
      633 volunteers who were randomly selected from the clientele of primary care 
      units located in the central districts of São Paulo, Brazil. Infection was 
      detected by two different ELISA assays with epimastigote antigens, followed by an 
      immunoblot with trypomastigote antigens as a confirmatory test. The prevalence of 
      the infection was 4.4%. Risk factors independently associated with the infection 
      were: a history of rural jobs in Bolivia, knowledge of the vector involved in 
      transmission, and having relatives with Chagas disease. Brazil has successfully 
      eliminated household vector transmission of T. cruzi, as well as its transmission 
      by blood transfusion. The arrival of infected immigrants represents an additional 
      challenge to primary care clinics to manage chronic Chagas disease, its vertical 
      transmission, and the blood derivatives and organ transplant programs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antibodies directed against domain 1 of β2 glycoprotein 1 
      (aβ2GP1-Dm1) have been involved in the immunopathogenesis of antiphospholipid 
      syndrome (APS). However, the clinical relevance of aβ2GP1-Dm1 in thrombotic APS 
      has not yet been fully explored. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of 
      aβ2GP1-Dm1 in a cohort of patients with thrombotic APS, and to evaluate whether 
      testing for aβ2GP1-Dm1 could have a clinical impact upon the risk assessment of 
      the disease. METHODS: Patients were tested for aβ2GP1-Dm1 antibodies by 
      chemiluminescence (BioFlash/AcuStar®, ES). The presence of aβ2GP1-Dm1 was 
      evaluated in different clinical presentations of the disease. RESULTS: Eight-four 
      patients with a history of venous or arterial thrombosis were included. 
      Forty-five (54%) patients had aβ2GP1 antibodies and 40% of them were positive for 
      aβ2GP1-Dm1. Levels of aβ2GP1-Dm1 were higher in patients with systemic autoimmune 
      disease (AUC=0.665; 95% CI=0.544-0.786; P=0.01), positive antinuclear antibody 
      (AUC=0.654; 95% CI=0.535-0.772; P=0.01), triple antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) 
      positivity (AUC=0.680; 95% CI=0.534-0.825; P=0.02) and positive lupus 
      anticoagulant (AUC=0.639; 95% CI=0.502-0.776; P=0.07). In this cohort, aβ2GP1-Dm1 
      antibodies were not associated with the site of the first thrombosis (OR=0,62, 
      95% CI=0.20-1.94, P=0.42), thrombosis recurrence (OR=1.0, 95% CI=0.37-2.71, 
      P=1.0) or pregnancy morbidity (OR=1.5, 95% CI=0.33-7.34, P=0.58). In multivariate 
      analysis, positivity for aβ2GP1-Dm1 antibodies was associated with the diagnosis 
      of systemic autoimmune disease (OR=4.01, 95% CI=1.14-14.2; P=0.03) and triple aPL 
      positivity (OR=3.59, 95% CI=0.87-14.85; P=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: In the present 
      cohort of thrombotic-APS patients, aβ2GP1-Dm1 antibodies were related to the 
      diagnosis of systemic autoimmunity and complex serological profile of the 
      disease, as triple aPL positivity and positive antinuclear antibody. Thus, our 
      results suggest that testing for aβ2GP1-Dm1 antibodies may be useful for 
      improving APS risk assessment.

TI  - Effect of physical exercise training in patients with Chagas heart disease: study 
      protocol for a randomized controlled trial (PEACH study).
PG  - 433
LID - 10.1186/s13063-016-1553-4 [doi]
LID - 433
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of exercise training on Chagas heart disease are still 
      unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of exercise training over 
      functional capacity, cardiac function, quality of life, and biomarkers in Chagas 
      heart disease. METHODS: The PEACH study is a superiority randomized clinical 
      trial which will include subjects who meet the following criteria: Chagas heart 
      disease with a left ventricular ejection fraction below 45 % with or without 
      heart failure symptoms; clinical stability in the last 3 months; adherence to 
      clinical treatment; and age above 18 years. The exclusion criteria are: 
      pregnancy; neuromuscular limitations; smoking; evidence of non-chagasic heart 
      disease; systemic conditions that limit exercise practice or cardiopulmonary 
      exercise test; unavailability to attend the center three times a week during the 
      intervention period; and practitioners of regular exercise. The intervention 
      group will perform an exercise training intervention three times per week during 
      6 months and will be compared to the control group without exercise. Both groups 
      will undergo the same monthly pharmaceutical and nutritional counseling as well 
      as standard medical treatment according to the Brazilian consensus on Chagas 
      disease. The primary outcome is functional capacity based on peak exercise oxygen 
      consumption during cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Secondary outcomes are: 
      cardiac function; body composition; muscle respiratory strength; microvascular 
      reactivity; cardiac rhythm abnormalities; autonomic function; biochemical; 
      oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers; and quality of life. Subjects will 
      be evaluated at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months after randomization. Thirty 
      patients will be randomly assigned into exercise or control groups at a ratio of 
      1:1. DISCUSSION: Findings of the present study will be useful to determine if 
      physical exercise programs should be included as an important additional therapy 
      in the treatment of patients with Chagas heart disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02517632 (registered on 6 August 2015).

AB  - The objectives were to estimate incidence of congenital syphilis and verify 
      factors associated with vertical transmission. A national hospital-based study 
      was performed in 2011-2012 with 23,894 postpartum women using an in-hospital 
      interview and data from patient charts and prenatal cards. Univariate logistic 
      regression was performed to verify factors associated with congenital syphilis. 
      Estimated incidence of congenital syphilis was 3.51 per 1,000 live births (95%CI: 
      2.29-5.37) and vertical transmission rate was 34.3% (95%CI: 24.7-45.4). 
      Congenital syphilis was associated with lower maternal schooling, black skin 
      color, higher rate of risk factors for prematurity, late initiation of prenatal 
      care, fewer prenatal visits, and lower rate of prenatal serological testing. 
      Fetal mortality was six times higher in congenital syphilis, and newborns with 
      congenital syphilis showed higher hospital admission rates. Congenital syphilis 
      is a persistent public health problem in Brazil and is associated with greater 
      social vulnerability and gaps in prenatal care.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate the occurrence of Leishmania 
      infantum in the male and female genital tract and female mammary glands of dogs 
      and the parasite burden and to identify histological alterations associated with 
      this protozoan. Twenty male and 20 female Leishmania-seropositive dogs with 
      isolation of L. infantum were examined. Tissue samples of the prepuce, glans, 
      epididymis, testes, prostate, vulva, vagina, uterus, uterine tubes, and mammary 
      glands were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and histopathology. For 
      parasitological culture and in situ hybridization, samples were collected from 
      the testis, epididymis, and uterus. Additionally, seminal fluid was aspirated 
      from the epididymis for parasitological culture. In the genital tract, 34 (85 %) 
      dogs, including 18 males and 16 females, were positive for Leishmania. Of these, 
      27 (79 %) animals were symptomatic. Leishmania was detected in the mammary glands 
      of 13 (65 %) females. L. infantum was isolated for the first time from the 
      seminal fluid and uterus of naturally infected dogs. The parasite burden and 
      intensity of the inflammatory reaction were greater in the prepuce and glans of 
      males and in the vulva and mammary glands of females. In addition to 
      inflammation, testicular degeneration, atrophy, absence of spermatogenesis, and 
      necrosis were observed. Detection of amastigote forms in the mammary gland lumen 
      indicates possible elimination of this parasite in milk. The frequent parasitism 
      observed in the genital tract of infected males and females and the viability of 
      L. infantum in seminal fluid and uterus suggest the possibility of bidirectional 
      venereal and vertical transmission.

TI  - Detection and sequencing of Zika virus from amniotic fluid of fetuses with 
      microcephaly in Brazil: a case study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of microcephaly in Brazil in 2015 was 20 times higher 
      than in previous years. Congenital microcephaly is associated with genetic 
      factors and several causative agents. Epidemiological data suggest that 
      microcephaly cases in Brazil might be associated with the introduction of Zika 
      virus. We aimed to detect and sequence the Zika virus genome in amniotic fluid 
      samples of two pregnant women in Brazil whose fetuses were diagnosed with 
      microcephaly. METHODS: In this case study, amniotic fluid samples from two 
      pregnant women from the state of Paraíba in Brazil whose fetuses had been 
      diagnosed with microcephaly were obtained, on the recommendation of the Brazilian 
      health authorities, by ultrasound-guided transabdominal amniocentesis at 28 
      weeks' gestation. The women had presented at 18 weeks' and 10 weeks' gestation, 
      respectively, with clinical manifestations that could have been symptoms of Zika 
      virus infection, including fever, myalgia, and rash. After the amniotic fluid 
      samples were centrifuged, DNA and RNA were extracted from the purified virus 
      particles before the viral genome was identified by quantitative reverse 
      transcription PCR and viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic 
      reconstruction and investigation of recombination events were done by comparing 
      the Brazilian Zika virus genome with sequences from other Zika strains and from 
      flaviviruses that occur in similar regions in Brazil. FINDINGS: We detected the 
      Zika virus genome in the amniotic fluid of both pregnant women. The virus was not 
      detected in their urine or serum. Tests for dengue virus, chikungunya virus, 
      Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, HIV, 
      Treponema pallidum, and parvovirus B19 were all negative. After sequencing of the 
      complete genome of the Brazilian Zika virus isolated from patient 1, phylogenetic 
      analyses showed that the virus shares 97-100% of its genomic identity with 
      lineages isolated during an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013, and that in 
      both envelope and NS5 genomic regions, it clustered with sequences from North and 
      South America, southeast Asia, and the Pacific. After assessing the possibility 
      of recombination events between the Zika virus and other flaviviruses, we ruled 
      out the hypothesis that the Brazilian Zika virus genome is a recombinant strain 
      with other mosquito-borne flaviviruses. INTERPRETATION: These findings strengthen 
      the putative association between Zika virus and cases of microcephaly in neonates 
      in Brazil. Moreover, our results suggest that the virus can cross the placental 
      barrier. As a result, Zika virus should be considered as a potential infectious 
      agent for human fetuses. Pathogenesis studies that confirm the tropism of Zika 
      virus for neuronal cells are warranted. FUNDING: Consellho Nacional de

AB  - An unusually high incidence of microcephaly in newborns has recently been 
      observed in Brazil. There is a temporal association between the increase in cases 
      of microcephaly and the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic. Viral RNA has been detected 
      in amniotic fluid samples, placental tissues and newborn and fetal brain tissues. 
      However, much remains to be determined concerning the association between ZIKV 
      infection and fetal malformations. In this study, we provide evidence of the 
      transplacental transmission of ZIKV through the detection of viral proteins and 
      viral RNA in placental tissue samples from expectant mothers infected at 
      different stages of gestation. We observed chronic placentitis (TORCH type) with 
      viral protein detection by immunohistochemistry in Hofbauer cells and some 
      histiocytes in the intervillous spaces. We also demonstrated the neurotropism of 
      the virus via the detection of viral proteins in glial cells and in some 
      endothelial cells and the observation of scattered foci of microcalcifications in 
      the brain tissues. Lesions were mainly located in the white matter. ZIKV RNA was 
      also detected in these tissues by real-time-polymerase chain reaction. We believe 
      that these findings will contribute to the body of knowledge of the mechanisms of 
      ZIKV transmission, interactions between the virus and host cells and viral 
      tropism.

TI  - Zika virus in the Americas: Early epidemiological and genetic findings.
PG  - 345-349
LID - 10.1126/science.aaf5036 [doi]
AB  - Brazil has experienced an unprecedented epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV), with 
      ~30,000 cases reported to date. ZIKV was first detected in Brazil in May 2015, 
      and cases of microcephaly potentially associated with ZIKV infection were 
      identified in November 2015. We performed next-generation sequencing to generate 
      seven Brazilian ZIKV genomes sampled from four self-limited cases, one blood 
      donor, one fatal adult case, and one newborn with microcephaly and congenital 
      malformations. Results of phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses show a single 
      introduction of ZIKV into the Americas, which we estimated to have occurred 
      between May and December 2013, more than 12 months before the detection of ZIKV 
      in Brazil. The estimated date of origin coincides with an increase in air 
      passengers to Brazil from ZIKV-endemic areas, as well as with reported outbreaks 
      in the Pacific Islands. ZIKV genomes from Brazil are phylogenetically 
      interspersed with those from other South American and Caribbean countries. 
      Mapping mutations onto existing structural models revealed the context of viral 
      amino acid changes present in the outbreak lineage; however, no shared amino acid 
      changes were found among the three currently available virus genomes from 
      microcephaly cases. Municipality-level incidence data indicate that reports of 
      suspected microcephaly in Brazil best correlate with ZIKV incidence around week 
      17 of pregnancy, although this correlation does not demonstrate causation. Our 
      genetic description and analysis of ZIKV isolates in Brazil provide a baseline 
      for future studies of the evolution and molecular epidemiology of this emerging 
      virus in the Americas.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of dengue virus infection 
      during pregnancy and its correlation with low birth weight, prematurity, and 
      asphyxia. A non-concurrent cohort study reveals the association of dengue during 
      pregnancy with prematurity and low birth weight, when birth occurred during the 
      maternal-fetal viremia period (p = 0.016 and p < 0.0001, respectively).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Galectin-3, a β-galactoside binding lectin, has been described as a 
      mediator of cardiac fibrosis in experimental studies and as a risk factor 
      associated with cardiovascular events in subjects with heart failure. Previous 
      studies have evaluated the genetic susceptibility to Chagas disease in humans, 
      including the polymorphisms of cytokine genes, demonstrating correlations between 
      the genetic polymorphism and cardiomyopathy development in the chronic phase. 
      However, the relationship between the galectin-3 single nucleotide polymorphism 
      (SNP) and phenotypic variations in Chagas disease has not been evaluated. 
      OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine whether genetic polymorphisms of 
      galectin-3 may predispose to the development of cardiac forms of Chagas disease. 
      METHODS: Fifty-five subjects with Chagas disease were enrolled in this 
      observational study. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for 
      genotyping the variants rs4644 and rs4652 of the galectin-3 gene. RESULTS: For 
      the SNP rs4644, the relative risk for the cardiac form was not associated with 
      the genotypes AA (OR = 0.79, p = 0.759), AC (OR = 4.38, p = 0.058), or CC (OR = 
      0.39, p = 0.127). Similarly, for the SNP rs4652, no association was found between 
      the genotypes AA (OR = 0.64, p = 0.571), AC (OR = 2.85, p = 0.105), or CC (OR = 
      0.49, p = 0.227) and the cardiac form of the disease. CONCLUSION: Our results 
      showed no association between the different genotypes for both SNPs of the 
      galectin-3 gene and the cardiac form of Chagas disease.

TI  - High rates of baseline antiretroviral resistance among HIV-infected pregnant 
      women in an HIV referral centre in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
PG  - 922-8
LID - 10.1177/0956462414562477 [doi]
AB  - In order to understand antiretroviral resistance during pregnancy and its impact 
      on HIV vertical transmission, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of 231 
      HIV-infected pregnant women who fulfilled Brazilian guidelines for antiretroviral 
      testing and had antiretroviral genotypic testing performed between April 2010 and 
      October 2012. At entry into prenatal care, the mean CD4 cell count for this 
      cohort of patients was 406 cells/mm(3) (95% CI: 373-438 cells/mm(3)), while the 
      mean HIV RNA was 24,394 copies/ml (95% CI: 18,275-30,513 copies/ml). Thirty-six 
      women (16%) had detectable antiretroviral-resistant mutations. By 34 weeks 
      gestation, 75% had achieved HIV RNA <400 copies/ml. Our logistic regression model 
      showed the odds of harbouring antiretroviral-resistant virus with a baseline CD4 
      cell count of <200 cells/mm(3) was eight times that of subjects with CD4 cell 
      counts >500 CD4 cells/mm(3) (95% CI 1.5-42.73). Six infants were HIV infected, 
      four born to mothers with detectable viraemia at 34 weeks and two born to mothers 
      who were lost to follow up. Antiretroviral resistance is common in prenatal care 
      but did not increase vertical transmission if viral load was appropriately 
      suppressed. Genotyping should be considered in Brazil in order to assist 
      initiation of appropriate combination antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy to 
      suppress viral load to avoid vertical transmission.

TI  - Congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi in central Brazil. A study of 1,211 
      individuals born to infected mothers.

AB  - Transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi during pregnancy is estimated to occur in less 
      than 20% of infected mothers; however, the etiopathogenesis is not completely 
      understood. The Centre for Studies on Chagas Disease provides confirmation of T. 
      cruzi infection for individuals living in central Brazil. In this retrospective 
      hospital-based study, all requests for diagnosis of T. cruzi infection in 
      individuals less than 21 years old from 1994-2014 were searched. We end with 
      1,211 individuals and their respective infected mothers. Congenital transmission 
      of infection was confirmed in 24 individuals (2%) in central Brazil, an area 
      where the main T. cruzi lineage circulating in humans is TcII. This low 
      prevalence of congenital Chagas disease is discussed in relation to recent 
      findings in the south region of Brazil, where TcV is the main lineage and 
      congenital transmission has a higher prevalence (approximately 5%), similar to 
      frequencies reported in Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. This is the first report 
      to show geographical differences in the rates of congenital transmission of T. 
      cruzi and the relationship between the prevalence of congenital transmission and 
      the type of Tc prevalent in each region.

TI  - Deep sequencing of the Trypanosoma cruzi GP63 surface proteases reveals diversity 
      and diversifying selection among chronic and congenital Chagas disease patients.
PG  - e0003458
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003458 [doi]
LID - e0003458
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chagas disease results from infection with the diploid protozoan 
      parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. T. cruzi is highly genetically diverse, and 
      multiclonal infections in individual hosts are common, but little studied. In 
      this study, we explore T. cruzi infection multiclonality in the context of age, 
      sex and clinical profile among a cohort of chronic patients, as well as paired 
      congenital cases from Cochabamba, Bolivia and Goias, Brazil using amplicon deep 
      sequencing technology. METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A 450bp fragment of the 
      trypomastigote TcGP63I surface protease gene was amplified and sequenced across 
      70 chronic and 22 congenital cases on the Illumina MiSeq platform. In addition, a 
      second, mitochondrial target--ND5--was sequenced across the same cohort of cases. 
      Several million reads were generated, and sequencing read depths were normalized 
      within patient cohorts (Goias chronic, n = 43, Goias congenital n = 2, Bolivia 
      chronic, n = 27; Bolivia congenital, n = 20), Among chronic cases, analyses of 
      variance indicated no clear correlation between intra-host sequence diversity and 
      age, sex or symptoms, while principal coordinate analyses showed no clustering by 
      symptoms between patients. Between congenital pairs, we found evidence for the 
      transmission of multiple sequence types from mother to infant, as well as 
      widespread instances of novel genotypes in infants. Finally, non-synonymous to 
      synonymous (dn:ds) nucleotide substitution ratios among sequences of TcGP63Ia and 
      TcGP63Ib subfamilies within each cohort provided powerful evidence of strong 
      diversifying selection at this locus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results shed 
      light on the diversity of parasite DTUs within each patient, as well as the 
      extent to which parasite strains pass between mother and foetus in congenital 
      cases. Although we were unable to find any evidence that parasite diversity 
      accumulates with age in our study cohorts, putative diversifying selection within 
      members of the TcGP63I gene family suggests a link between genetic diversity 
      within this gene family and survival in the mammalian host.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The benign character formerly attributed to Plasmodium vivax 
      infection has been dismantled by the increasing number of reports of severe 
      disease associated with infection with this parasite, prompting the need for more 
      thorough and comprehensive characterization of the spectrum of resulting clinical 
      complications. Endemic areas exhibit wide variations regarding severe disease 
      frequency. This study, conducted simultaneously in Brazil and India, constitutes, 
      to our knowledge, the first multisite study focused on clinical characterization 
      of P. vivax severe disease. METHODS: Patients admitted with P. vivax 
      mono-infection at reference centers in Manaus (Amazon - Brazil) and Bikaner 
      (Rajasthan - India), where P. vivax predominates, were submitted to standard 
      thorough clinical and laboratory evaluations in order to characterize clinical 
      manifestations and identify concurrent co-morbidities. RESULTS: In total, 778 
      patients (88.0% above 12 years old) were hospitalized at clinical discretion with 
      PCR-confirmed P. vivax mono-infection (316 in Manaus and 462 in Bikaner), of 
      which 197 (25.3%) presented at least one severity criterion as defined by the 
      World Health Organization (2010). Hyperlactatemia, respiratory distress, 
      hypoglycemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation were more frequent in 
      Manaus. Noteworthy, pregnancy status was associated as a risk factor for severe 
      disease (OR = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.2-3.4; P = 0.007). The overall case fatality rate 
      was 0.3/1,000 cases in Manaus and 6.1/1,000 cases in Bikaner, with all deaths 
      occurring among patients fulfilling at least one severity criterion. Within this 
      subgroup, case fatality rates increased respectively to 7.5% in Manaus and 4.4% 
      in Bikaner. CONCLUSION: P. vivax-associated severity is not negligible, and 
      although lethality observed for complicated cases was similar, the overall 
      fatality rate was about 20-fold higher in India compared to Brazil, highlighting 
      the variability observed in different settings. Our observations highlight that 
      pregnant women and patients with co-morbidities need special attention when 
      infected by this parasite due to higher risk of complications.

TI  - Syphilis in HIV-infected mothers and infants: results from the NICHD/HPTN 040 
      study.
PG  - e52-7
LID - 10.1097/INF.0000000000000578 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Untreated syphilis during pregnancy is associated with spontaneous 
      abortion, stillbirth, prematurity and infant mortality. Syphilis may facilitate 
      HIV transmission, which is especially concerning in low- and middle-income 
      countries where both diseases are common. METHODS: We performed an analysis of 
      data available from NICHD/HPTN 040 (P1043), a study focused on the prevention of 
      intrapartum HIV transmission to 1684 infants born to 1664 untreated HIV-infected 
      women. This analysis evaluates risk factors and outcomes associated with a 
      syphilis diagnosis in this cohort of HIV-infected women and their infants. 
      RESULTS: Approximately, 10% of women (n=171) enrolled had serological evidence of 
      syphilis without adequate treatment documented and 1.4% infants (n=24) were 
      dually HIV and syphilis infected. Multivariate logistic analysis showed that 
      compared with HIV-infected women, co-infected women were significantly more 
      likely to self-identify as non-white (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.5, 95% CI: 
      1.5-4.2), to consume alcohol during pregnancy (AOR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.1) and to 
      transmit HIV to their infants (AOR 2.1, 95% CI: 1.3-3.4), with 88% of HIV 
      infections being acquired in utero. As compared with HIV-infected or HIV-exposed 
      infants, co-infected infants were significantly more likely to be born to mothers 
      with venereal disease research laboratory titers≥1:16 (AOR 3, 95% CI: 1.1-8.2) 
      and higher viral loads (AOR 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-1.9). Of 6 newborns with symptomatic 
      syphilis, 2 expired shortly after birth, and 2 were HIV-infected. CONCLUSION: 
      Syphilis continues to be a common co-infection in HIV-infected women and can 
      facilitate in utero transmission of HIV to infants. Most infants are asymptomatic 
      at birth, but those with symptoms have high mortality rates.

AB  - Considering that interleukin 10 (IL10), transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFB1), 
      and interferon gamma (IFNG) are involved in the susceptibility of BeWo 
      trophoblast cells to Toxoplasma gondii infection, the aim of the present study 
      was to investigate the effector mechanisms triggered by these cytokines in the 
      control of T. gondii in BeWo cells. For this purpose, infected/uninfected BeWo 
      cells were treated with IL10, TGFB1 (50 ng/ml), and IFNG (20 or 100 ng/ml) in 
      order to verify the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of 
      transcription 1 (STAT1), STAT3, and Smad2, parasite intracellular proliferation, 
      as well as the Th1/Th2/IL17A cytokine production. The treatment of BeWo cells 
      with IL10 and TGFB1 favored T. gondii proliferation, and these findings were 
      associated with STAT3 and Smad2 phosphorylation, respectively (P < 0.05). Also, 
      these cytokine treatments were able to down-modulate TNF alpha (TNFA) and IL6 
      production (P < 0.05). Low concentration of IFNG was unable to control T. gondii 
      infection but was able to trigger STAT1 phosphorylation and up-regulate IL6 and 
      IL17A production; whereas a high concentration of IFNG was unable to activate 
      STAT1 but down-modulated IL6 and TNFA and increased T. gondii proliferation (P < 
      0.05). IL10, TGFB1, and IFNG regulate a differential T. gondii proliferation in 
      BeWo cells because they distinctly trigger intracellular signaling pathways and 
      cytokine production, especially IL6 and TNFA. Our data open new windows to 
      understand the mechanisms triggered by IL10, TGFB1, and IFNG at the 
      maternal-fetal interface in the presence of T. gondii, contributing to 
      recognizing the importance of these effector mechanisms involved in the vertical 
      transmission of this parasite.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rate of vertical HIV transmission has decreased in Brazil, but 
      regional inequalities suggest problems in implementing control measures during 
      pregnancy and delivery. The aims of this study were to ascertain the coverage of 
      HIV testing during prenatal care and estimate the prevalence of HIV infection 
      during pregnancy in Brazil. METHODS: This was a national hospital-based study of 
      23,894 women that was conducted in 2011-2012. The data came from interviews with 
      mothers during postpartum hospitalization, from hospital medical files and from 
      prenatal cards. All the pregnant women with reactive serological results for HIV 
      infection marked on their cards or with diagnoses of HIV infection during the 
      hospital stay for delivery were considered cases of HIV infection. Univariate and 
      multivariable logistic regression were performed to investigate factors 
      associated with the prevalence of HIV infection and with performing at least one 
      HIV test during pregnancy. RESULTS: Among participating women, the coverage of 
      testing for HIV infection was 81.7% among those who presented with prenatal card 
      and the prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant women was 0.4% (95% CI: 
      0.32-0.51%). In the adjusted analysis, there was higher coverage of testing among 
      women living in the South and Southeast regions; of women aged 35 years and over; 
      with greater schooling levels; who self-reported as white; with prenatal care 
      provided in private services; with an early start to prenatal care; and with an 
      adequate number of consultations, defined as a minimum of six for a term 
      pregnancy. In the adjusted analyses there was a greater odds ratio of HIV 
      infection among women living in the South region, aged 35 years and over, with 
      schooling of less than 8 years, who self-reported race as black, without a 
      partner, with syphilis coinfection and who were attended by public services. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HIV infection among pregnant women in Brazil 
      remains below 1% and the coverage of testing for HIV infection is over 80%. 
      However, the regional and social inequalities in access to healthcare services 
      and the missed opportunities for diagnoses of HIV infection indicate the 
      importance of strengthening HIV infection control programs during pregnancy.

PG  - 1623-52
LID - 10.1517/14740338.2014.975204 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antiretroviral (ARV) drug use during pregnancy significantly 
      reduces mother-to-child HIV transmission, delays disease progression in the women 
      and reduces the risk of HIV transmission to HIV-serodiscordant partners. Pregnant 
      women are susceptible to the same adverse reactions to ARVs as nonpregnant adults 
      as well as to specific pregnancy-related reactions. In addition, we should 
      consider adverse pregnancy outcomes and adverse reactions in children exposed to 
      ARVs during intrauterine life. However, studies designed to assess the safety of 
      ARV in pregnant women are rare, usually with few participants and short follow-up 
      periods. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we discuss studies reporting adverse 
      reactions to ARV drugs, including maternal toxicity, adverse pregnancy outcomes 
      and the consequences of exposure to ARV in infants. We included results of 
      observational studies, both prospective and retrospective, as well as randomized 
      clinical trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. EXPERT OPINION: The 
      benefits of ARV use during pregnancy outweigh the risks of adverse reactions 
      identified to date. More studies are needed to assess the adverse effects in the 
      medium- and long term in children exposed to ARVs during pregnancy, as well as 
      pregnant women using lifelong antiretroviral therapy and more recently available 
      drugs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our study presents a method to generate a novel detection 
      coefficient for the association between leprosy and pregnancy (DCLP). Methods The 
      DCLP was calculated for women from the State of Pará (2007-2009), Brazil. Data 
      were ordered, divided into five equal parts (corresponding to the P20, P40, P60, 
      and P80 percentiles), and classified as low, medium, high, very high, or 
      hyperendemic. RESULTS: Using the new index, we established the DCLP parameters 
      for low (<0.36), medium (0.36-0.69), high (0.70-1.09), very high (1.10-1.50), and 
      hyperendemic (>1.50). CONCLUSIONS: The new DCLP is more appropriate than the 
      overall detection coefficient (DC), which does not take into account the 
      particularities of the interaction between a disease and a specific physiological 
      state.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart disease progression occurs in 30% of patients with chronic 
      Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Supplementation with selenium (Se) in animal model 
      of T. cruzi infection produced promising results. There is evidence that patients 
      with Chagas heart disease have lower Se levels than healthy individuals and 
      patients with T. cruzi infection without of cardiac disease. The aim of this 
      investigation is to estimate the effect of Se treatment on prevention of heart 
      disease progression in patients with chagasic cardiopathy. METHODS: The Selenium 
      Treatment and Chagasic Cardiopathy trial is a superiority, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. The eligibility criteria are as 
      follows: (1) a Chagas disease diagnosis confirmed by serology; (2) segmental, 
      mild or moderate global left ventricular systolic dysfunction; and (3) age 
      between 18 and 65 years. The exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) pregnancy, 
      (2) diabetes mellitus, (3) tobacco use, (4) alcohol abuse, (5) evidence of 
      nonchagasic heart disease, (6) depression, (7) dysphagia with evidence of food 
      residues in the esophagus, (8) dysphagia with weight loss higher than 15% of 
      usual weight in the last four months and/or (9) conditions that may result in low 
      protocol adherence. The intervention will be 100 μg of sodium selenite once daily 
      for 365 consecutive days compared to placebo. The following are the primary 
      outcomes to be measured: (1) the trajectories of the left ventricular ejection 
      fraction in the follow-up period; (2) reduction of heart disease progression 
      rates, with progression defined as a 10% decrease in left ventricular ejection 
      fraction; and (3) rate of hospital admissions attributable to dysrhythmia, heart 
      failure or stroke due to Chagas disease. One hundred thirty patients will be 
      randomly allocated into either the intervention or placebo group at a ratio of 
      1:1. The sequence allocation concealment and blinding were planned to be 
      conducted with the strategy of numbered boxes. Both patients and health-care 
      providers will remain blinded to the intervention groups during the 5 years of 
      follow-up. DISCUSSION: If Se treatment reduces the progression of Chagas 
      cardiopathy, the inclusion of this micronutrient in the daily diet can improve 
      the therapeutic regimen for this neglected tropical disease at low cost. TRIAL

TI  - Prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women and congenital transmission of 
      Trypanosoma cruzi in Brazil: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 943-57
LID - 10.1111/tmi.12328 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women and the 
      risk of congenital transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in Brazil, through 
      a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched electronic databases, 
      grey literature and reference lists of included publications to identify 
      epidemiological studies on the prevalence of Chagas disease in pregnant women and 
      on the congenital transmission rate of T. cruzi infection in Brazil published 
      between January 1980 and June 2013. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals 
      (95% CIs) were calculated using fixed- and random-effects models. RESULTS: 
      Sixteen articles were included - 12 studies on the prevalence of Chagas disease 
      in pregnant women (549,359 pregnant women) and nine on congenital transmission 
      rates (1687 children born to infected mothers). Prevalence of Chagas disease in 
      pregnant women ranged from 0.1% to 8.5%, and congenital transmission rates from 
      0% to 5.2%. The pooled prevalence of Chagas disease among pregnant women across 
      studies was 1.1% (95% CI: 0.6-2.0); the pooled congenital transmission rate was 
      1.7% (95% CI: 0.9-3.1). In 2010, 34,629 pregnant women were estimated to be 
      infected with T. cruzi, and 312-1073 children born (mean: 589 cases) with 
      congenital infection. CONCLUSION: Congenital Chagas disease is a neglected public 
      health problem in Brazil. Systematic congenital Chagas disease control programs 
      through routine prenatal screening for T. cruzi should be widely implemented in 
      Brazil's endemic areas, to identify infected pregnant women and newborns at risk 
      of congenital infection.

AB  - Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
      infection remains an important cause of new HIV infections worldwide, especially 
      in low and middle-resource limited countries. Safety data from studies involving 
      pregnant women and prenatal antiretroviral (ARV) exposure are still needed once 
      these studies are often small and with a limited duration to assess adverse drug 
      reactions (ADR). The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of ADR 
      related to the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnant women in two 
      referral centers in Rio de Janeiro State. A prospective study was carried out 
      from February 2005 to May 2006. Women were classified according to their ART 
      status during pregnancy diagnosis: ARV-experienced (ARTexp) or ARV-naïve (ARTn). 
      Two hundred fourteen HIV-infected pregnant women were included: 36 ARTexp and 178 
      ARTn. ARTexp women have not experienced ADR. Among ARTn, 20.2% presented ADR. 
      Incidence rate of ADR was 70.8 per 1000 person-months and the most common ADRs 
      observed were: gastrointestinal (belly or abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea and 
      vomit) in 16.3%, cutaneous (pruritus and rash) in 6.2%, anemia (2.2%) and 
      hepatitis (1.7%). The frequency of obstetrical complications, pre-term delivery, 
      low birth weight and birth abnormalities was low in this population. ADRs ranged 
      from mild to moderate intensity, none of them being potentially fatal. Only in a 
      few cases it was necessary to discontinue ART. In conclusion, the high 
      effectiveness of ARV for HIV prevention of MTCT (PMTCT) overcomes the risk of 
      ADR.

      treatment. She presented with impaired cardiac function during the acute phase 
      (pericarditis and incomplete right bundle-branch block) that resolved favorably 
      after benznidazole therapy. Serological results also became negative, as 
      determined by hemagglutination assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and 
      immunofluorescence assays. The child was born without sequelae and showed no 
      evidence of congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection at birth or 24 days later.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the access to the interventions for the prevention of 
      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) mother to child transmission and mother to 
      child transmission rates in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, from 1999 to 2009. 
      METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. Prevention of HIV mother to child 
      transmission interventions were accessed and mother to child transmission rates 
      were calculated. RESULTS: The study population is young (median: 26 years; 
      interquartile range: 22.0-31.0), with low monthly family income (40.4% up to one 
      Brazilian minimum wage) and schooling (62.1% less than 8 years). Only 47.1% 
      (n=469) knew the HIV status of their partner; of these women, 39.9% had an 
      HIV-seronegative partner. Among the 1259 newborns evaluated, access to the 
      antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum prevention of HIV mother to child 
      transmission components occurred in 59.2%, 74.2%, and 97.5% respectively; 91.0% 
      of the newborns were not breastfed. Overall 52.7% of the newborns have benefited 
      from all the recommended interventions. In subsequent pregnancies (n=289), 67.8% 
      of the newborns received the full package of interventions. The overall rate of 
      HIV vertical transmission was 4.7% and the highest annual rate occurred in 2005 
      (7.4%), with no definite trend in the period. CONCLUSIONS: Access to the full 
      package of interventions for the prevention of HIV vertical transmission was low, 
      with no significant trend of improvement over the years. The vertical 
      transmission rates observed were higher than those found in reference services in 
      the municipality of Rio de Janeiro and in the richest regions of the country.

TI  - Combination antiretroviral treatment for women previously treated only in 
      pregnancy: week 24 results of AIDS clinical trials group protocol a5227.
PG  - 542-50
LID - 10.1097/QAI.0000000000000072 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with HIV and prior exposure to combination antiretroviral 
      therapy (cART) solely for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (pMTCT) need 
      to know whether they can later be treated successfully with a commonly used 
      regimen of efavirenz (EFV) and coformulated emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir 
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF). METHODS: Nonpregnant women with plasma HIV-1 RNA of 
      ≥500 copies per milliliter, previously cART exposed for pMTCT only, were eligible 
      if they were off ART for ≥24 weeks before entry, were without evidence of drug 
      resistance on standard genotyping, and were ready to start EFV plus FTC/TDF. The 
      primary endpoint was virologic response (defined as plasma HIV RNA <400 
      copies/mL) at 24 weeks. RESULTS: Fifty-four women were enrolled between October 
      2007 and December 2009; 52 of 54 completed 24 weeks of follow-up. Median baseline 
      CD4 T-cell count was 265/mm and baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA was 4.6 log10 copies 
      per milliliter. Median prior cART duration was 14 weeks, and median time elapsed 
      from the last pMTCT dose to entry was 22 months. Virologic response at 24 weeks 
      was observed in 42 of 52 women or 81% (exact 95% confidence interval: 68% to 
      90%). There were no differences in response by country, by number, or class of 
      prior pMTCT exposures. Although confirmed virologic failure occurred in 8 women, 
      no virologic failures were observed in women reporting perfect early adherence. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this first prospective clinical trial studying combination 
      antiretroviral retreatment in women with a history of pregnancy-limited cART, the 
      observed virologic response to TDF/FTC and EFV at 24 weeks was 81%. Virologic 
      failures occurred and correlated with self-reported nonadherence.

TI  - Chagas disease: don't forget it in Latin American patients with heart block!
PG  - 206-8
AB  - Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and mostly affects 
      poor rural populations of central and south America. It is mainly acquired by 
      bugs (triatoma) but also by ingestion of the parasite (fresh fruit juices) or by 
      foetal-maternal blood passing. Despite an important decrease in transmission 
      during the last decades in several countries, millions of patients are still 
      chronically infected and most of them are asymptomatic. In 2012-2013, two cases 
      were admitted in our cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) with heart block due to 
      Chagas cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis was established by echocardiography and positive 
      serological results for Trypanosoma cruzi. This report underlines that in cases 
      of heart failure and conduction abnormalities of unclear aetiology, Chagas 
      disease should be taken into consideration, even in patients originating from 
      non-endemic countries.

TI  - Effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in patients with 
      chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy: study protocol for a randomized controlled 
      trial.
PG  - 379
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-14-379 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy is an inflammatory disease that 
      occurs in approximately 30% of patients infected by the protozoan Trypanosoma 
      cruzi, and it has a profile of high morbidity and mortality. The worst prognosis 
      and the progression of this cardiomyopathy are associated with an exacerbated 
      immune response and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, which also occur 
      in other cardiomyopathies. Some nutrients, including omega-3 polyunsaturated 
      fatty acids (PUFAs), promote the inhibition and/or stimulation of cytokine 
      production. The objective of this trial is to study the effects of omega-3 PUFA 
      supplementation on the inflammatory response and lipid profile in patients with 
      chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a parallel, randomized, 
      placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial with 40 patients that will be 
      conducted at a reference unit for Chagas disease patients, where the patients 
      will be selected. The study will include patients with chronic chagasic 
      cardiomyopathy who are 18 years of age or older. The exclusion criteria are (a) 
      ongoing diarrheal disease, (b) inflammatory bowel disease, (c) diabetes or other 
      endocrine disease, (d) use of fibrates, niacin, or statins, (e) use of 
      anti-inflammatory drugs, (f) pregnant and lactating women, (g) use of vitamin, 
      mineral, or omega-3 supplementation during the previous 30 days, (h) hospital 
      admission during the study, and (i) other associated cardiomyopathies. The 
      intervention will be treatment with omega-3 PUFAs at a dose of 3 g/day for 8 
      weeks, compared to placebo (corn oil). The primary endpoints will be the 
      concentrations of inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, 
      IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, interferon (IFN)γ, and transforming growth 
      factor (TGF)β). Secondary endpoints will be the fasting glucose, lipid, and 
      anthropometric profiles. For statistical analysis, we plan to run either a t test 
      or Wilcoxon test (numerical variables) and Pearson's χ2 or Fisher's exact test 
      (categorical data), as appropriate. DISCUSSION: Evidence suggests that the 
      anti-inflammatory action of omega-3 PUFAs may have beneficial effects on chronic 
      chagasic cardiomyopathy, as shown for other cardiomyopathies, due to improved 
      control of the inflammatory response. At the end of the study, we predict that 
      patients will have lower inflammatory markers and an improved metabolic and 
      anthropometric profile. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials 
      NCT01863576.

TI  - Is pregnancy associated with severe dengue? A review of data from the Rio de 
      Janeiro surveillance information system.
PG  - e2217
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0002217 [doi]
LID - e2217
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dengue is a reportable disease in Brazil; however, pregnancy has been 
      included in the application form of the Brazilian notification information system 
      only after 2006. To estimate the severity of maternal dengue infection, the 
      available data that were compiled from January 2007 to December 2008 by the 
      official surveillance information system of the city of Rio de Janeiro were 
      reviewed. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the study period, 151,604 cases 
      of suspected dengue infection were reported. Five hundred sixty-one women in 
      their reproductive age (15-49 years) presented with dengue infection; 99 (18.1%) 
      pregnant and 447 (81.9%) non-pregnant women were analyzed. Dengue cases were 
      categorized using the 1997 WHO classification system, and DHF/DSS were considered 
      severe disease. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare maternal age, according 
      to gestational period, and severity of disease. A chi-square test was utilized to 
      evaluate the differences in the proportion of dengue severity between pregnant 
      and non-pregnant women. Univariate analysis was performed to compare outcome 
      variables (severe dengue and non-severe dengue) and explanatory variables 
      (pregnancy, gestational age and trimester) using the Wald test. A multivariate 
      analysis was performed to assess the independence of statistically significant 
      variables in the univariate analysis. A p-value<0.05 was considered statistically 
      significant. A higher percentage of severe dengue infection among pregnant women 
      was found, p = 0.0001. Final analysis demonstrated that pregnant women are 3.4 
      times more prone to developing severe dengue (OR: 3.38; CI: 2.10-5.42). Mortality 
      among pregnant women was superior to non-pregnant women. CONCLUSION: Pregnant 
      women have an increased risk of developing severe dengue infection and dying of 
      dengue.

TI  - Epidemiological profile of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected mothers and live birth 
      conditions in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil.
PG  - 196-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess the epidemiological 
      characteristics of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected mothers and the live birth 
      conditions of neonates. METHODS: A serological survey with IgG-specific tests was 
      conducted using dried blood samples from newborn infants in the State of Minas 
      Gerais. T. cruzi infection was confirmed in mothers through positive serology in 
      two different tests, and infected mothers were required to have their infants 
      serologically tested after the age of 6 months. The birth conditions of the 
      neonates were obtained from the System of Information on Live Births database. 
      RESULTS: The study included 407 children born to T. cruzi-infected mothers and 
      407 children born to uninfected mothers. The average age of seropositive mothers 
      was 32 years (CI95% 31.3-32.6), which was greater than the average age of 
      seronegative mothers - 25 years (CI95% 24.8-25.2). The mothers' level of 
      education was higher among uninfected mothers (41% had 8 or more years of 
      education, versus 22% between the infected mothers). Vaginal delivery was more 
      frequent among infected mothers. There was no evidence of inter-group differences 
      with respect to the child's sex, gestational age, birth weight or Appearance, 
      pulse, grimace, activity and respiration (APGAR) scores at 1 and 5 minutes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The level of education and the greater number of previous 
      pregnancies and cases of vaginal delivery reflect the lower socioeconomical 
      conditions of the infected mothers. In the absence of vertical transmission, 
      neonates had similar health status irrespective of the infection status of their 
      mothers.

TI  - Congenital syphilis: a sentinel event in antenatal care quality.
PG  - 147-56; discussion 157
LID - S0034-89102013000100019 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate antenatal care in reducing the vertical transmission of 
      syphilis. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed to be representative of 
      low-risk pregnancies in women cared for at the Brazilian Unified Health System 
      (SUS) network in the city of Rio de Janeiro, from November 2007 to July 2008. 
      Pregnant women diagnosed with syphilis were identified through interviews, 
      checking their antenatal care card and searching for reported cases in the public 
      health information systems. Cases of congenital syphilis were sought at the 
      disease reporting system (Sinan), the Mortality Information System (SIM) and the 
      SUS's Hospital Information System (SIH). RESULTS: Syphilis was identified in 46 
      of the pregnancies, and 16 cases of congenital syphilis were identified, 
      resulting in a prevalence of 1.9% (95%CI 1.3;2.6) of syphilis in pregnancy and an 
      incidence of 6/1,000 (95%CI 3;12/1,000) of congenital syphilis. The vertical 
      transmission rate was 34.8% with three cases resulting in death (1 abortion, 1 
      stillborn and 1 neonatal death) and high proportions of prematurity and low birth 
      weight. The healthcare pathway of those women revealed flaws in the care they 
      received, such as late entry to antenatal care, syphilis remaining undiagnosed 
      during pregnancy and lack of treatment for the partner. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative 
      strategies are needed to improve the outcomes of syphilis in pregnancy, including 
      improving the laboratory network, the quality of care delivered to the pregnant 
      women and their sexual partners and, most important of all, investigating every 
      case of congenital syphilis as a sentinel event in the quality of antenatal care.

      TcI subpatent maternal parasitemia.
PG  - 671-8
LID - 10.1007/s00436-012-3184-3 [doi]
AB  - The congenital transmission of Chagas disease is associated with an increase in 
      parasitemia during pregnancy, maternal and fetal immunity, and populations of 
      Trypanosoma cruzi. In this study, the biological behavior of TcI and TcV 
      (isolated from a human congenital case) strains and their potential for 
      experimental congenital transmission were evaluated in female BALB/C mice. 
      Parasitemia was estimated by fresh blood examination, semiquantitative 
      microhematocrit, and hemoculture, while congenital transmission was evaluated by 
      culture in the liver infusion tryptose medium and by polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) of the pups' tissues on postnatal day 7 and of the pups' blood sample at 30 
      days after birth. Infection was detected in 100 % of the females. Both strains 
      showed subpatent parasitemia, which was higher for TcV infection. The presence of 
      amastigote nest was detected only in an animal infected with TcI. The 
      inflammatory process was more frequent (p = 0.001) in the tissues of the animals 
      infected with TcV (58.6 %) than TcI (31.1 %). The fertility rates of females 
      mated after 35 days postinfection were similar (90 % for TcV, 88.9 % for TcI; p = 
      0.938). Parasitemia did not change during pregnancy. The average number of 
      pups/female was greater (p = 0.03) in mice with TcV infection (8.30) than in 
      those with TcI infection (4.78). Congenital transmission was detected exclusively 
      by PCR in 50.9 % of the pups, 46.6 % for TcV and 58.1 % for TcI. The PCR 
      positivity for TcI was higher in the blood than in the tissue (p = 0.003). These 
      results demonstrate the T. cruzi experimental congenital infection associated 
      with subpatent maternal parasitemia of TcI and TcV.

TI  - Descriptive study of HTLV infection in a population of pregnant women from the 
      state of Pará, Northern Brazil.
PG  - 453-6
LID - S0037-86822012005000007 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In Brazil, studies have shown that HTLV seroprevalence among 
      pregnant women varies from 0 to 1.8%. However, this seroprevalence was unknown in 
      the State of Pará, Brazil. The present study describes, for the first time, the 
      HTLV seroprevalence among pregnant women from the State of Pará, Northern Brazil. 
      METHODS: 13,382 pregnant women were submitted to HTLV screening during prenatal 
      care, and those with non-seronegative results to anti-HTLV were submitted to 
      Western blot (WB) test to confirm and separate HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 carriers. 
      RESULTS: HTLV seroprevalence in the population of pregnant women was 0.3%, and 
      HTLV-1 was identified in 95.3% of patients. The demographic profile of HTLV 
      carriers was as follows: women with age between 20 and 40 years old (78.4%); 
      residing in the metropolitan region of Belém, Pará (67.6%); and with educational 
      level of high school (56.8%). Other variables related to infection were as 
      follows: beginning of sexual intercourse between the age of 12 and 18 years old 
      (64.9%) and have being breastfed for more than 6 months (51.4%). Most of the 
      women studied had at least two previous pregnancies (35.1%) and no abortion 
      (70.3%). Coinfections (syphilis and HIV) were found in 10.8% (4/37) of these 
      pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence of HTLV infection in pregnant women 
      assisted in basic health units from the State of Pará, Northern Brazil, was 0.3% 
      similar to those described in other Brazilian studies. The variables related to 
      infection were important indicators in identifying pregnant women with a higher 
      tendency to HTLV seropositivity, being a strategy for disease control and 
      prevention, avoiding vertical transmission.

PG  - 569-74
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.2011.10-0015 [doi]
AB  - One hundred fifty-two Trypanosoma cruzi seropositive women were submitted to a 
      single hemoculture; 101 were pregnant, and 51 were not pregnant. Seven tubes from 
      each individual were harvested with liver infusion tryptose (LIT) medium and 
      observed monthly until the fifth month. Hemocultures were positive in 50% (76 of 
      152) of the women. Results showed that the positivity was 29.4% (15 of 51) among 
      non-pregnant women and 60.4% (61 of 101) in pregnant women (P < 0.05). In 
      relation to gestational age, there were significant differences in positivity, 
      with a higher proportion of women with positive hemocultures (20 of 25) before 21 
      weeks and lower after 30 weeks (10 of 21; P = 0.02). We conclude that pregnancy 
      enhances the parasitemia in Chagas disease, with a higher effect early in 
      pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of assisted reproduction 
      techniques (ART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serodiscordant couples. 
      DESIGN: Systematic review of five databases of noncomparative open intervention 
      and observational studies of serodiscordant couples undergoing ART, with study 
      selection and data extraction performed independently and in duplicate. SETTING: 
      Tertiary fertility centers. PATIENT(S): HIV serodiscordant couples where the man 
      is HIV positive. INTERVENTION(S): Intrauterine insemination (IUI), in vitro 
      fertilization (IVF), or intracytoplasmic injection (ICSI) performed after washed 
      semen viral testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Pregnancy rates per cycle, 
      cumulative pregnancy, abortion rate, and HIV seroconversion in newborns or women. 
      RESULT(S): Of the 658 abstracts retrieved, 41 were selected for review, and 17 
      full articles were included (3,900 IUI cycles in 1,184 couples in 11 aggregated 
      studies and 738 ICSI/IVF cycles in 579 couples across 10 studies). The IUI and 
      ICSI results were, respectively: pregnancy rates per cycle, 18% and 38.1%; 
      cumulative pregnancy, 50% and 52.9%; and abortion rate, 15.6% and 20.6%. No 
      seroconversions in women or newborns were detectable at birth or after 3 to 6 
      months. CONCLUSION(S): Cumulative evidence suggests that ART is safe and 
      effective for avoiding horizontal and vertical transmission in HIV serodiscordant 
      couples.

AB  - Congenital toxoplasmosis is a potentially severe infection and its prevention is 
      most often based on serological screening in pregnant women. Many cases could be 
      prevented by simple precautions during pregnancy. Aiming to assess the knowledge 
      about toxoplasmosis among professionals working in antenatal care in a high 
      prevalent region, a questionnaire was administered to 118 obstetric nurses and 
      physicians attending at primary care units and hospitals. The questionnaire was 
      self-completed and included questions on diagnosis, clinical issues, and 
      prevention. Only 44% of total answers were corrected. Lower scores were observed 
      among those with over 10 years of graduation, working in primary care units, and 
      nurses. Errors were mainly observed in questions of prevention and diagnosis. As 
      congenital toxoplasmosis is a mother-to-child (MTC) transmitted disease, early 
      diagnosis and treatment can prevent serious and irreversible fetal damage. Thus, 
      doctors and nurses who provide prenatal care must be appropriately trained on 
      prophylactic, diagnostic, and clinical aspects of toxoplasmosis. The authors 
      suggest that measures should be taken for continuing education regarding 
      toxoplasmosis in pregnancy.

PG  - 108-21
LID - S0037-86822011000800015 [pii]
AB  - A survey for seroprevalence of Chagas disease was held in a representative sample 
      of Brazilian individuals up to 5 years of age in all the rural areas of Brazil, 
      with the single exception of Rio de Janeiro State. Blood on filter paper was 
      collected from 104,954 children and screened in a single laboratory with two 
      serological tests: indirect immunofluorescence and enzyme linked immunoassay. All 
      samples with positive or indetermined results, as well as 10% of all the negative 
      samples were submitted to a quality control reference laboratory, which performed 
      both tests a second time, as well as the western blot assay of TESA 
      (Trypomastigote Excreted Secreted Antigen). All children with confirmed final 
      positive result (n = 104, prevalence = 0.1%) had a follow-up visit and were 
      submitted to a second blood collection, this time a whole blood sample. In 
      addition, blood samples from the respective mothers and familiar members were 
      collected. The infection was confirmed in only 32 (0.03%) of those children. From 
      them, 20 (0.025%) had maternal positive results, suggesting congenital 
      transmission; 11 (0.01%) had non-infected mothers, indicating a possible 
      vectorial transmission; and in one whose mother had died the transmission 
      mechanism could not be elucidated. In further 41 visited children the infection 
      was confirmed only in their mothers, suggesting passive transference of maternal 
      antibodies; in other 18, both child and mother were negative; and in 13 cases 
      both were not localized. The 11 children that acquired the infection presumably 
      through the vector were distributed mainly in the Northeast region of Brazil 
      (States of Piauí, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba and Alagoas), in addition 
      to one case in Amazonas (North region) and another in Parana (South region). 
      Remarkably, 60% of the 20 cases of probably congenital transmission were from a 
      single State, Rio Grande do Sul, with the remaining cases distributed in other 
      states. This is the first report demonstrating regional geographical differences 
      in the vertical transmission of Chagas disease in Brazil, which probably reflects 
      the predominant Trypanosoma cruzi group IId and IIe (now TcV and TcVI) found in 
      this state. Overall, these results show that the regular and systematic control 
      programs against the transmission of Chagas disease, together with socioeconomic 
      changes observed in Brazil in the last decades, interrupted the vectorial 
      transmission in Brazil, resumed in the few cases found in this national survey. 
      Furthermore they reinforce the need for maintenance of control programs for the 
      consolidation of this major advance in public health.

AB  - Vectorial, transfusion and congenital are considered the main transmission 
      mechanisms in human Chagas disease. Alternative mechanisms are accidental, oral 
      and by organ transplantation. Other hypothetic mechanisms could be by other 
      vectors, sexual, criminal and by means of marsupial anal secretions. The present 
      accorded strategies for prevention are: CONGENITAL: early case detection and 
      immediate treatment. If possible, start during the pre natal period, throughout 
      mothers serology, performing parasitological tests in the new born from positive 
      women. For positive cases, immediate treatment; for those negative babies, 
      conventional serology at the 8th month, treating specifically those with positive 
      results. ACCIDENTAL TRANSMISSION: Rigorous training and utilization of protection 
      equipments. IF accident occurs, immediate disinfection, conventional serology and 
      beginning of specific treatment by ten days. Revision of the serology after 30 
      days: if positive, extend the treatment until the total dose (60 days or more). 
      ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION: previous serology for donor and receptor. When the former 
      is infected and the last negative, cancel the surgery or install the specific 
      treatment by ten days before the surgery for the donor, followed by the receptor 
      during ten days after the transplantation. ORAL TRANSMISSION: Specific measures 
      are not available, food hygiene is recommended, including the cooking of meats 
      delivered from possible reservoirs. Nowadays, the detection and immediate 
      treatment of the case is recommended, followed by active research of new cases 
      around the detected one.

      in HIV-infected women in Brazil.
PG  - 349-56
LID - 10.3851/IMP1779 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information is lacking on outcomes in HIV-infected Brazilian women 
      with CD4(+) T-cell counts >200 cells/mm(3) who initiate HAART for the prevention 
      of mother-to-child transmission, and discontinue after delivery. METHODS: 
      Clinical event rates after postpartum HAART discontinuation were calculated for 
      all WHO stage 2-3 events, as well as for HIV progression warranting HAART 
      re-initiation, defined by a WHO stage 4 event and/or CD4(+) T-cell decrease to 
      ≤200 cells/mm(3). Predictors of the WHO stage 2-3 events and HIV progression 
      outcomes were evaluated with Cox's proportional hazards models. RESULTS: A total 
      of 120 women were followed for a mean of 1.5 years after delivery. Overall, 26 
      women had 30 events as follows: 20 developed WHO stage 2-3 events, yielding an 
      incidence rate of 13/100 person-years (PY; 95% CI 8-20); 10 developed HIV 
      progression requiring HAART re-initiation (incidence ratio 6/100 PY, 95% CI 
      3-11). Among progressors, a single woman developed a WHO stage 4 clinical event 
      and the remainder had CD4(+) T-cell decreases. Women who had baseline CD4(+) 
      T-cell counts between 200-500 cells/mm(3) had a hazard ratio for WHO stage 2-3 
      events of 2.5 compared to women with baseline ≥500 cells/mm(3) (95% CI 1.0-6.3; 
      P=0.05). The only significant predictor of HIV progression was baseline CD4(+) 
      T-cell count (hazard ratio 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-0.99; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      observational study, a baseline CD4(+) T-cell count <500 cells/mm(3) was 
      associated with an increased risk of postpartum WHO stage 2-3 clinical events and 
      HIV disease progression. Randomized studies are needed to further evaluate the 
      effect of postpartum treatment discontinuation on maternal health.

PG  - 55
LID - 10.1186/1476-072X-9-55 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irregularly shaped spatial clusters are difficult to delineate. A 
      cluster found by an algorithm often spreads through large portions of the map, 
      impacting its geographical meaning. Penalized likelihood methods for Kulldorff's 
      spatial scan statistics have been used to control the excessive freedom of the 
      shape of clusters. Penalty functions based on cluster geometry and 
      non-connectivity have been proposed recently. Another approach involves the use 
      of a multi-objective algorithm to maximize two objectives: the spatial scan 
      statistics and the geometric penalty function. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: We present a 
      novel scan statistic algorithm employing a function based on the graph topology 
      to penalize the presence of under-populated disconnection nodes in candidate 
      clusters, the disconnection nodes cohesion function. A disconnection node is 
      defined as a region within a cluster, such that its removal disconnects the 
      cluster. By applying this function, the most geographically meaningful clusters 
      are sifted through the immense set of possible irregularly shaped candidate 
      cluster solutions. To evaluate the statistical significance of solutions for 
      multi-objective scans, a statistical approach based on the concept of attainment 
      function is used. In this paper we compared different penalized likelihoods 
      employing the geometric and non-connectivity regularity functions and the novel 
      disconnection nodes cohesion function. We also build multi-objective scans using 
      those three functions and compare them with the previous penalized likelihood 
      scans. An application is presented using comprehensive state-wide data for 
      Chagas' disease in puerperal women in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      show that, compared to the other single-objective algorithms, multi-objective 
      scans present better performance, regarding power, sensitivity and positive 
      predicted value. The multi-objective non-connectivity scan is faster and better 
      suited for the detection of moderately irregularly shaped clusters. The 
      multi-objective cohesion scan is most effective for the detection of highly 
      irregularly shaped clusters.

TI  - HIV rapid testing as a key strategy for prevention of mother-to-child 
      transmission in Brazil.
PG  - 803-11

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of HIV rapid testing for pregnant women at 
      maternity hospital admission and of subsequent interventions to reduce perinatal 
      HIV transmission. METHODS: Study based on a convenience sample of women unaware 
      of their HIV serostatus when they were admitted to delivery in public maternity 
      hospitals in Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre, Brazil, between March 2000 and 
      April 2002. Women were counseled and tested using the Determine HIV1/2 Rapid 
      Test. HIV infection was confirmed using the Brazilian algorithm for HIV infection 
      diagnosis. In utero transmission of HIV was determined using HIV-DNA-PCR. There 
      were performed descriptive analyses of sociodemographic data, number of previous 
      pregnancies and abortions, number of prenatal care visits, timing of HIV testing, 
      HIV rapid test result, neonatal and mother-to-child transmission interventions, 
      by city studied. RESULTS: HIV prevalence in women was 6.5% (N=1,439) in Porto 
      Alegre and 1.3% (N=3.778) in Rio de Janeiro. In Porto Alegre most of women were 
      tested during labor (88.7%), while in Rio de Janeiro most were tested in the 
      postpartum (67.5%). One hundred and forty-four infants were born to 143 
      HIV-infected women. All newborns but one in each city received at least 
      prophylaxis with oral zidovudine. It was possible to completely avoid newborn 
      exposure to breast milk in 96.8% and 51.1% of the cases in Porto Alegre and Rio 
      de Janeiro, respectively. Injectable intravenous zidovudine was administered 
      during labor to 68.8% and 27.7% newborns in Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro, 
      respectively. Among those from whom blood samples were collected within 48 hours 
      of birth, in utero transmission of HIV was confirmed in 4 cases in Rio de Janeiro 
      (4/47) and 6 cases in Porto Alegre (6/79). CONCLUSIONS: The strategy proved 
      feasible in maternity hospitals in Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre. Efforts must 
      be taken to maximize HIV testing during labor. There is a need of strong social 
      support to provide this population access to health care services after hospital 
      discharge.

TI  - Modelling congenital transmission of Chagas' disease.
PG  - 215-22
LID - 10.1016/j.biosystems.2009.11.005 [doi]
AB  - The successful elimination of vectorial and transfusional transmission of Chagas' 
      disease from some countries is a result of the reduction of domestic density of 
      the primary vector Triatoma infestans, of almost 100% of coverage in blood 
      serological selection and to the fact that the basic reproductive number of 
      Chagas' disease is very close to one (1.25). Therefore, congenital transmission 
      is currently the only way of acquiring Chagas' Disease in such regions. In this 
      paper we propose a model of congenital transmission of Chagas' disease. Its aim 
      is to provide an estimation of the time period it will take to eliminate this 
      form of transmission in regions where vetorial transmission was reduced to close 
      to zero, like in Brazil.

TI  - Chagas cardiomyopathy--where do we stand after a hundred years?
PG  - 300-16
LID - 10.1016/j.pcad.2009.11.008 [doi]
AB  - A hundred years from its description, Chagas cardiomyopathy remains a challenging 
      disease. Although successful vector-control strategies have decreased the 
      incidence of Chagas disease in several Latin American countries, both migration 
      to urban areas and immigration have spread the disease worldwide; and now, blood 
      transfusion, organ transplantation, and vertical transmission are a concern. The 
      pathogenesis of Chagas cardiomyopathy involves complex host-parasite 
      interactions, where low-grade but incessant systemic infection and triggered 
      autoimmune reaction are the main mechanisms for its development, with the 
      contribution of autonomic damage and microvascular disturbances. Chagas 
      cardiomyopathy is the most important clinical presentation of Chagas disease and 
      comprises a wide range of manifestations, including heart failure, arrhythmias, 
      heart blocks, sudden death, thromboembolism, and stroke. Recently, simple 
      clinical prognostic scores have been developed to identify high-risk patients and 
      help with management. The treatment of Chagas cardiomyopathy focuses mostly on 
      managing heart failure, arrhythmias, and thromboembolism. The role of specific 
      antiparasitic therapy in the chronic form is not yet defined, and a randomized 
      trial is now under way to address this crucial point. In this article, we review 
      the main clinical aspects of Chagas cardiomyopathy and underscore some upcoming 
      challenges for the appropriate control, diagnosis, and management of this complex 
      disease.
